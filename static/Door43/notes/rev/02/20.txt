\v 20 Nevertheless, you have done something wrong: You tolerate that woman among your people who is like that wicked Queen Jezebel who lived long ago. She says that she is a prophetess. However, by what she teaches, she is deceiving my servants. She is urging them to commit sexual immorality and to eat food that they have offered to idols.
\v 21 Although I gave her time to turn away from her sexual immorality and pagan practices, she did not want to stop.
