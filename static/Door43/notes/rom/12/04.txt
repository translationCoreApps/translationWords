\v 4 Although a person has one body, it consists of many parts. All of the parts are needed for\add the body\add*, but they do not all function the same way.
\v 5 Similarly we, \add although we are\add* many, are \add united into\add* one group because of our relationship with Christ, and we belong to one another. \add So no one should act as though he\add* needed by God more\add than the others!\add*

\v 4 Although a person has one body, it consists of many parts. All of the parts are necessary for the body, but they do not all function the same way.
\v 5 Similarly, we, although we are many, are united into one group because we are joined to Christ, and we belong to one another. So no one should act as though he is more important than the others!

\v 4 For we have many members in one body, but not all the members have the same function.
\v 5 In the same way, we who are many are one body in Christ, and are individually members of each other.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For** - Paul uses this word to show that he will now explain why some Christians should not think they are better than others.
  * **we have many members in one body** - Paul refers to all the believers in Christ as if they were different parts of the human body. He does this to illustrate that although believers may serve Christ in different ways, each person belongs to Christ and serves in an important way. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **members** - These are such things as eyes, stomachs, and hands.
  * **are individually members of each other** - Paul speaks of the believers as if God had physically joined them together like the parts of the human body. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God has joined each believer together with all other believers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
