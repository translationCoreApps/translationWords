<usfm>
\v 24 We have heard that certain men to whom we gave no such commandment, went out from us and have troubled you with teachings that make trouble for your souls.
\v 25 So it seemed good to all of us to agree to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
\v 26 people who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
