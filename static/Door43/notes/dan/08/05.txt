\v 5 While I thinking \add about what I had seen\add*, I saw a goat come from the west. It ran across the land very quickly, \add with the result that it seemed that\add* its feet did not touch the ground. This goat had one very large horn between its eyes.
\v 6 It was very angry, and it ran straight toward the ram that I had seen previously, the ram that was standing alongside the canal.

\v 5 As I was thinking about this, I saw a male goat come from the west, who went across the surface of the whole earth, running fast, not seeming to touch the ground. The goat had a large horn between his eyes.
\v 6 He came to the ram who had two horns—I had seen the ram standing on the bank of the canal—and the goat ran toward the ram in a powerful rage.

  * **The goat had a large horn between his eyes** - Goats have two horns on the sides of their heads. This image should be explained. AT: "The goat had a single large horn in the center of his head" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
