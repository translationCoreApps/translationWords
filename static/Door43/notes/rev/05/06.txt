===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Then I saw Jesus, the one who is like a \f + \ft metaphor \f* sacrificial lamb, standing there. He stood near the throne, in the midst of the four living creatures and the elders. It appeared that he had been killed \f + \ft Or:that people had killed him \f*, but he was alive again. He had seven horns, and he had seven eyes that symbolize the Spirit of God who has all kinds of power \f + \ft Or: who is also symbolized as seven spirits \f*. \add He\add* sends \add God's\add* Spirit out into all the earth.
\v 7 He came and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who sits on the throne.

\v 6 Then I saw a Lamb standing there in the midst of the four living creatures and the elders around the throne. Although he was alive, he had marks that showed that someone had killed him. He had seven horns, and he had seven eyes that are the seven spirits of God that God sends out over all the earth.
\v 7 The Lamb came and took the scroll from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne.

\v 6 I saw a Lamb standing between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders. He looked as though he had been killed. He had seven horns and seven eyes; these are the seven spirits of God sent out over all the earth.
\v 7 He went and took hold of the scroll out of the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne.
