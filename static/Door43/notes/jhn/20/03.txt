\v 3 When they heard this, Peter and the other disciple rushed out to the tomb.

  * **the other disciple** - John apparently shows his humility by referring to himself here as "the other disciple," rather than including his name.
  * **went out** - John implies that these disciples were going to the tomb. AT: "rushed out to the tomb" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **linen cloths** - These were the burial cloths that people had used to wrap the body of Jesus.
