\v 26 This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah and said,
\v 27 "Look! I am Yahweh, God of all mankind. Is anything too difficult for me to do?
\v 28 Therefore Yahweh says this, 'See, I am about to give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. He will capture it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah** - The phrase "the word of Yahweh came" is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:14:01|14:01]]. AT: "This is the message that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah" or "This is the message that Yahweh gave to Jeremiah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah and said** - "This is what Yahweh said to Jeremiah"
  * **came to Jeremiah** - It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. You may translate using first person, as the UDB does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Is anything too difficult for me to do?** - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that he can do anything. AT: "Nothing is too difficult for me to do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **See, I am about to give** - "Listen carefully! I am the one who will give"
  * **give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans** - Yahweh speaks of the city as if it were a small object that he could put into a person's hand. The word "hand" is a metonym for the power that the hand puts into action. AT: "put this city under the power of the Chaldeans" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
