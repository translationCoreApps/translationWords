====== Isaiah 17:10-11 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 That will happen because you have stopped worshiping God
\q2 who is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a huge rock under which you can be safe.
\q1 You have forgotten that he is the one who can hide\f + \ft Or: protect \f* you.
\q1 So, now you plant very nice grapevines
\q2 and even plant very expensive ones that come from other countries.
\q1
\v 11 But even if they sprout leaves on the day that you plant them,
\q2 and even if they produce blossoms on that same morning,
\q1 at harvest time, there will not be any grapes for you to pick.
\q2 All that you will get is a lot of agony\f + \ft Or: misery \f*.

\q1
\v 10 For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have ignored the rock of your strength.
\q1 So you plant pleasant plants, and set out vine branches received from a stranger,
\q1
\v 11 on the day you plant and hedge and cultivate. Soon your seed will grow,
\q1 but the harvest will fail on a day of grief and of desperate sorrow.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For you have forgotten** - Here "you" refers to the people of Israel. The word "forgotten" does not mean they have no memory of God. It means they no longer obey him. AT: "For you no longer obey"
  * **the God of your salvation** - "the God who saves you"
  * **and have ignored the rock of your strength** - This compares God to a large rock which people could climb on to get away from their enemies or hide behind. AT: "and have ignored God, who is like a rock that protects you" or "and have ignored the one who protects you"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the harvest will fail** - "there will not be much fruit for you to harvest"
