====== Nahum 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:1-13, which is a poetic prophecy. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

Despite being divided into three chapters, this book contains one long prophecy. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Complete destruction ==
At this time, Assyria controlled almost the entire Near East. Nahum prophesies that they will be completely destroyed as a nation so that they will not even be a people group any longer. This prophecy came true and did so very suddenly. At times, this chapter is very violent in describing the destruction of Assyria, which should not be toned down through the use of euphemism.
