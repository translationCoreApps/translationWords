  * **the church throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria** - This is the first use of the singular "church" to refer to more than one local congregation. Here it refers to all the believers in all the groups throughout Israel.
  * **had peace** - "lived peacefully" (UDB). This means the persecution that started with the murder of Stephen was finished.
  * **was built up** - The agent was either God or the Holy Spirit. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God helped them grow" or "the Holy Spirit built them up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

  * **he came down** - The phrase "came down" is used here because Lydda is lower in elevation than the other places where he was traveling.
  * **Lydda** - Lydda is a city located about 18 kilometers southeast of Joppa. This city was called Lod in the Old Testament and in modern Israel.
