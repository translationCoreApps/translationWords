\v 11 My friends and neighbors stay away from me because of my sores;
\q2 even my own family stays far from me.

\q2 those who want to harm me discuss the ways that they can get rid of me;
\q2 they plot against me all day.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **lay snares for me** - The plots of the writer's enemies are spoken of as if they were traps that they had set to catch him like an animal. AT: "set traps to catch me" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **speak destructive words and say deceitful words** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize the hurtful nature of what these people say. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
