\v 1 This is the word that came from Yahweh to Jeremiah when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur son of Malkijah and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest to him. They said to him,
\v 2 "Seek advice from Yahweh on our behalf, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is making war on us. Perhaps Yahweh will do miracles for us, as in times past, and will make him withdraw from us."
