===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer finishes telling about what he had said.

  * **tempest** - a strong storm
  * **Devour them** - Destroying something is spoken of as eating all of it. Possible meanings are "Destroy my enemies'  plans" or "Destroy my enemies." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **confuse their language** - "Language" here represents what the people were saying to each other, and probably refers specifically to them talking about plans to do evil. Confusing it represents making the people unable to understand each other. AT: "confuse them when they speak to each other" or "confuse their plans" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
