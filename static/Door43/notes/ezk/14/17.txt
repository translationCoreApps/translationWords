\v 17 Or if I bring a sword against that land and say, 'Sword, go through the land and cut off both man and beast from it',
\v 18 then even if these three men were in the midst of the land—as I live, declares the Lord Yahweh—they would not be able to rescue even their own sons or daughters; only their own lives would be rescued.
