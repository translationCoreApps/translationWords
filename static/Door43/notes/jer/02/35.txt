====== Jeremiah 02:35-37 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 you say 'We have not done anything that is wrong;
\q2 so surely \add Yahweh\add* is not angry with us.'
\q1 But I will punish \f + \ft metonymy \f* you \add severely\add*
\q2 for saying 'We have not sinned.'
\b
\q1
\v 36 Previously you requested \add the army of\add* Assyria to help you,
\q2 but they were not able to help you.
\q1 Now you have requested \add the army\add* Egypt to help you,
\q2 but they will not be able to help you, either.
\q1
\v 37 They will capture you, and you will be \add their prisoners\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
\q2 led to Egypt, \add very ashamed\add* with your hands on your heads.
\q1 That will happen because I, Yahweh, have rejected those nations that you are relying on,
\q2 and they will not be able to help you at all."
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 Yet you say, 'I have done nothing wrong!
\q2 I am sure that Yahweh will not be angry with me for much longer.'
\q1 But I will punish you severely
\q2 for claiming that you have not sinned.
\q1
\v 36 Previously you requested the army of Assyria to help you,
\q2 but they were not able to help you.
\q1 Now you have requested the army of Egypt to help you,
\q2 but they will not be able to help you, either.
\q1
\v 37 They will capture you, and you will be their prisoners,
\q2 very ashamed with your hands on your heads.
\q1 That will happen because Yahweh has rejected those nations that you are relying on,
\q2 and they will not be able to help you at all."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 35 Yet you say, 'I am innocent; surely his anger has turned away from me.'
\q But look! I will bring down judgment on you because you say, 'I have not sinned.'
\q
\v 36 Why do you treat so very lightly this change in your ways?
\q You will also be disappointed by Egypt, just as you were by Assyria.
\q
\v 37 You will also go out from there dejected, with your hands on your head,
\q for Yahweh has rejected the ones whom you trusted, so you will not be helped by them."
</usfm>
