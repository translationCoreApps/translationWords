===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The arrival of Jesus' mother and brothers becomes an opportunity for him to describe his spiritual family.

  * **behold** - The word "behold" alerts us to a new people in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **his mother** - This is Mary, Jesus' human mother.
  * **his brothers** - These are probably other children born to Mary. But, it is possible they are Jesus' cousins.
  * **seeking to speak** - "wanting to speak"
  * **Someone said to him, "Look, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you."** - This can be translated as an indirect quotation. AT: "Someone told Jesus that his mother and brothers were outside and wanted to speak to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
