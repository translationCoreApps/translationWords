<usfm>
\v 17 Continue to remember what the Amalek people-group did to your ancestors when they were coming out of Egypt.
\v 18 They attacked your ancestors as they were traveling, when they were weak and exhausted. Those people were not afraid of God at all, so they attacked your ancestors from the rear and killed all those who were unable to walk as fast as the others.
\v 19 Therefore, when Yahweh our God has given you the land \add that he promised to give you\add*, and when he has enabled you to rest from \add fighting\add* all your enemies around you, kill all the Amalek people-group, with the result that no one will remember them anymore. Do not forget \add to do this\add*!"

\v 17 Call to mind what Amalek did to you on the road as you came out of Egypt,
\v 18 how he met you on the road and attacked those of you at the rear, all who were feeble in your rear, when you were faint and weary; he did not honor God.
\v 19 Therefore, when Yahweh your God has given you rest from all your enemies round about, in the land that Yahweh your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance, you must not forget that you must blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
