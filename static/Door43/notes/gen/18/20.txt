===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "outcry" is expressed as the verb "accuse." AT: "so many people have been accusing the people of Sodom and Gomorrah of doing evil things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **their sin is so serious** - "they have sinned so much"
  * **I will now go down there** - "I will now go down to Sodom and Gomorrah"
  * **go down there and see** - "go down there to find out" or "go down there to decide"
  * **see the outcry ... that has come to me** - Yahweh speaks as if he knew about this matter because he had heard the cries and accusations coming from the people who had suffered. This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "outcry" is expressed as the verb "accuse." AT: "as wicked as those who are accusing them say that they are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **If not** - "If they are not as wicked as the outcry suggests"
