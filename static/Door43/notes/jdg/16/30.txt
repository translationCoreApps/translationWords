\v 30 Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" He stretched out with his strength and the building fell on the rulers and on all the people who were in it. So the dead that he killed when he died were more than those he killed during his life.
\v 31 Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down. They took him, brought him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial place of Manoah, his father. Samson had judged Israel for twenty years.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He stretched out with his strength** - When Samson stretched out his arms he pushed down the pillars of the building. AT: "He used his strength to push against the pillars" or "he used his strength to push over the pillars" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the dead** - This refers to people who are dead. AT: "the dead people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **were more** - "were a greater amount"
  * **all the house of his father** - Here the word "house" refers to his family. AT: "all of his father's family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down** - The phrase "came down" is used here because the place that Samson's family traveled form was higher in elevation than Gaza.
  * **Zorah ... Eshtaol** - Translate the names of these the place the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:13:24|13:25]].

  * **Manoah** - Translate this man's name the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:13:01|13:2]].
  * **Samson had judged Israel for twenty years** - This same sentence is also in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:15:19|15:20]]. It is repeated here to remind readers of how long he judged Israel. AT: "Samson had judged Israel for twenty years before he died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **twenty years** - "20 years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
