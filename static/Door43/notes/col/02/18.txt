\v 18 Disregard those who say that God will punish you because \add you do not worship God in the way that\add* they say \add that you should\add*; that is, they insist that you should humiliate yourselves and that you should worship the angels. \add Disregard such people\add* since they base their authority on things that they have never seen, and since they are proud without reason because their self-directed nature \add controls\add* what they think,
\v 19 and since they do not teach the true teaching about Christ \f + \ft metaphor \f*\add . Christ is the one who causes all of his people to develop\f + \ft Or: grow \f* spiritually as God plans that they should develop\f + \ft Or: grow \f*, just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a person's head directs how his body grows, as it is held together by its joints and ligaments.

\v 18 Those same people pretend to be humble, and they love to worship angels. Do not let them convince you to do the same. If you do, you will lose what Christ has promised you. These people are always talking about visions they say God has made them see. They boast about these things because they think like people everywhere think who do not honor God.
\v 19 Such persons are not joined to Christ. Christ is the head of the body, and that body is all those who believe in him. The whole body depends upon the head. The head takes care of each part and puts together all the bones and ligaments so they work together, and it is God who makes it grow.

<usfm>
\v 18 Let no one who wants humility and the worship of angels judge you out of your prize. Such a person enters into the things he has seen and becomes puffed up by his fleshly thinking.
\v 19 He does not hold on to the head. It is from the head that the whole body throughout its joints and ligaments is supplied and held together; it grows with the growth given by God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let no one ... judge you out of your prize** - Here Paul refers to false teachers as if they were corrupt judges at an athletic contest who would unjustly disqualify the believers from winning the prizes they deserve, and he speaks of Christ saving a person as if Christ were giving a prize to the winner of such a contest. AT: "Let no one ... disqualify you from winning a prize" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who wants humility** - The word "humility" is a metonym for actions one does to make others think that one is humble. AT: "who wants you to do things to show that you are humble" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **enters into the things he has seen** - Here Paul  speaks about people who claim to have dreams and visions from God and who talk proudly about them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **becomes puffed up by his fleshly thinking** - Here Paul says that sinful ways of thinking make a person arrogant. AT: "puffs himself up by means of his fleshly thinking" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])  
  * **puffed up** - Here a person who boasts is spoken of as if he were an object into which someone had blown air to make it larger than it should be. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **his fleshly thinking** - Here the idea of flesh stands for the sinful human nature. "the sinful thoughts he naturally thinks" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He does not hold on to** - Paul speaks of trusting Christ as though one were grasping Christ with one's hands. AT: "He does not firmly grasp" or "He does not cling to," just as a child firmly holds on to his parent. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **It is from the head that the whole body throughout its joints and ligaments is supplied and held together** - Paul speaks of the church, which is ruled and empowered by Christ, as if it were a human body. "It is from the head that God supplies the whole body throughout its joints and ligaments and holds it together" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
