\v 18 \add Similarly, you are dissatisfied with both John and me!\add* When John came \add and preached to you\add*, he did not eat \add good food\add* and did not drink \add wine, like most people do\add*. But you \add rejected him\add* saying, 'A demon is controlling him!'
\v 19 \add In contrast\add*, \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, eat \add the same\add* food and drink \add wine as other people do\add*. But you \add reject me\add*, saying, 'Look! \add This man\add* eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he associates with tax collectors and \add other\add* sinners!' But people \add who really think about\add* what \add John\add* and I have done will realize that what we do is truly wise \f + \ft metaphor, personification \f*."

\v 18 I say this because you are dissatisfied with both John and me! When John came and preached to you, he did not eat good food and did not drink wine, like most people do. But you rejected him and said, 'A demon is controlling him!'
\v 19 I, the Son of Man, was not like John. I eat the same food and drink wine as other people do. But you also reject me and say, 'Look! This man eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he is friends with tax collectors and other sinners!' But anyone who is truly wise will show it by doing good deeds."

\v 18 For John came not eating bread or drinking wine, and they say, 'He has a demon.'
\v 19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking and they say, 'Look, he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is justified by her deeds."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus concludes talking to the crowds about John the Baptist.

  * **not eating bread or drinking wine** - Here "bread" refers to food. It does not mean that John never ate food. It means he fasted often, and when he ate he did not eat good, expensive food. AT: "frequently fasting and not drinking alcohol" or "not eating good food and drinking wine" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **they say, 'He has a demon.'** - This can be translated as an indirect quote. AT: "they say that he has a demon" or "they accuse him of having a demon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **they say** - All occurrences of "they" refer to the people of that generation, and most specifically to the Pharisees and religious leaders.
  * **The Son of Man** - Jesus is referring to himself. AT: "I, the Son of Man," (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **came eating and drinking** - This is the opposite of John's behavior. This means more than just consuming the normal amount of food and drink. It means Jesus celebrated and enjoyed good food and drink like other people did.
  * **they say, 'Look, he is a gluttonous man** - This can be translated as an indirect quote. AT: "they say that he is a gluttonous man" or "they accuse him of eating too much" If you translated "The Son of Man" as "I, the Son of man," the indirect quote could be translated as "they say that I am a gluttonous man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **he is a gluttonous man** - "he is a greedy eater" or "he continually eats too much food"
  * **a drunkard** - "a drunk" or "he continually drinks too much alcohol"
  * **But wisdom is justified by her deeds** - This is a proverb that Jesus applies to this situation, because the people who rejected both him and John were not being wise. Jesus and John the Baptist are the wise ones, and the results of their deeds prove it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]])
  * **wisdom is justified by her deeds** - Here "wisdom" is described as a woman who is proven to be right by what she does. Jesus means that the results of a person's actions prove that he is truly wise. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The results of a person's deeds prove that he is wise" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
