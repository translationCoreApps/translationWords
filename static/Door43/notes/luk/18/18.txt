<usfm>
\v 18 Once a Jewish leader asked Jesus, "Good teacher, what must I do in order to have eternal life?"
\v 19 Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? God is the only one who is truly good!
\p
\v 20 In answer to your question, certainly you know the commandments that God gave to Moses for us to obey: 'Do not commit adultery, do not murder anyone, do not steal, do not give a false report, honor your father and mother.'"
\v 21 The man said, "I have obeyed all those commandments ever since I was young."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This is the next event in the part of the story which began in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:17:20|17:20]]. Jesus begins to talk with a ruler about entering the kingdom of heaven.

  * **A certain ruler** - This introduces a new character in the story. It only identifies him by his position. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **what must I do** - "what do I need to do" or "what is required of me"
  * **inherit eternal life** - "receive life that does not end." The term "inherit" usually refers to the property that a man left to his children when  he dies. Therefore, this metaphor may mean he understood himself to be a child of God and desired for God to give him eternal life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Why do you call me good? No one is good, except God alone** - Jesus is asking the ruler if he realizes that calling Jesus "good" implies that Jesus is God. AT: "You know that no one is good except God alone. Why do you call me good?" or "You know that no one is good except God alone. Do you understand what you are saying when you call me good?"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **do not kill** - "do not murder"
  * **All these things** - "All of these commandments"
