===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He hugged his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck** - "Joseph hugged his brother Benjamin, and they both wept"
  * **He kissed all his brothers** - In ancient Near East, it is common to greet a relative with a kiss. If your language has an affectionate greeting for a relative, use that. If not, use what is appropriate.
  * **wept over them** - This means Joseph was crying while he kissed them.
  * **After that his brothers talked with him** - Earlier they were too afraid to speak. Now they feel they can speak freely. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "After that his brothers talked freely with him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
