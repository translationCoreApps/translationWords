====== Revelation 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart the songs in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:05:09|5:9-10]], [[:en:bible:notes:rev:05:11|5:12]] and [[:en:bible:notes:rev:05:13|5:13]]. This is typically done through the use of indentation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Sealed scroll ==
A sealed scroll contains a written message hidden and waiting to be read. The scroll can only be read by the person with the authority to open it.

== Twenty-four elders ==
This is probably a reference to church leaders, but the identity of the twenty-four elders is uncertain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_apocalypticwriting]])

== Christian prayers ==
The prayers of Christians are connected with incense. Christian prayers have a good smell to God. He is pleased when Christians pray.

== Seven spirits of God ==

The exact meaning of this phrase is unclear. It is possibly a symbolic reference to the Holy Spirit with the number seven symbolizing "completeness." It may also not be symbolic, and reference  seven spirits surrounding the throne of God.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
The "Lion of the tribe of Judah" and the "Root of David" are references to Jesus. They are metaphors and they function as titles for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
