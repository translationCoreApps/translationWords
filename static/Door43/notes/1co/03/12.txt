====== 1 Corinthians 03:12-13 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Furthermore, people can build a house on its foundation \add with materials that are valuable and do not burn easily, such as\add* gold, silver, and expensive jewels. Or they could build a house with \add materials that are not valuable and that burn easily, such as\add* wood, hay, and straw.
\v 13 Later it will become clear\f + \ft Or: evident \f* what kind of material they used to build the house. \add Similarly, when people teach others God's truth\add*, it will later become clear \add what kind of things they taught\add*. \add God\add* will make that clear\f + \ft Or: evident \f* at the time \add when he judges us\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 We are like builders who choose what to put on top of that foundation. Builders can chose to use valuable materials like gold, silver, and precious stones, or they can choose to use worthless materials like wood, hay, and straw.
\v 13 God will judge our work and put on display what each of us has done for him. He will send fire to test the work we have done. That fire will prove the quality of the work that we did for him.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,
\v 13 his work will be revealed, for the daylight will reveal it. For it will be revealed in fire. The fire will test the quality of what each one had done.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Paul speaks of what builders usually do when constructing a building to describe what the teachers in Corinth are actually doing. Builders usually only use gold, silver, or precious stones as decorations on buildings.

  * **Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw** - The building materials used to build a new building are being compared to the spiritual values used to build a person's behavior and activities during his lifetime. AT: "Whether a person builds with valuable materials that will last or with cheap materials that burn easily" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **precious stones** - "expensive stones"
  * **his work will be revealed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will show everyone what the builder has done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **for the daylight will reveal it** - The "daylight" here is a metaphor for the time when God will judge everyone. When God shows everyone what these teachers have done, it will be like the sun has come up to reveal what happened during the night. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For it will be revealed in fire. The fire will test the quality of what each one had done** - Just as fire will reveal the strengths or destroy the weaknesses of a building, God's fire will judge man's efforts and activities. AT: "God will use fire to  show the quality of his work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
