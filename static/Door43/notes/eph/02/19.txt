\v 19 So \add God no longer treats\add* you \add non-Jews\add* as \add people treat\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* foreigners and strangers \add who live among them\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Instead, along with all God's people, \add it is as though\add* you have become citizens of a country that he rules over, and \add as though you have become\add* members of the family\add of which he is the father\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 20 \add Just like\add* a building is built \f + \ft Or:\add as someone\add* builds a building \f* on a foundation, \add God has joined you into one group that originated, Or: began\add* from what the apostles and prophets \add taught\add*. Christ Jesus is the \add most important one in that group, just like a\add* cornerstone \add is the most important part of a building\add*. And
\v 21 just like \add a builder might\add* join together all the parts of a building to make it a temple that \add people will\add* dedicate to the Lord \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add Christ is continually causing all of\add* you who have a relationship with \add him to be united, in order that you will become one holy group\add*.
\v 22 And because of your relationship with Christ, \add God\add* is joining you \add non-Jews\add* together with \add Jewish believers\add* to be \add like\add* one building \f + \ft metaphor \f* in which his Spirit lives.

\v 19 Therefore now you non-Jews are no longer strangers and foreigners to God's people, but instead you are fellow members with those whom God has set apart for himself, and you belong to God's family for whom God is the Father.
\v 20 You are like stones that God has made to be part of his building, and the building is built on what the apostles and prophets taught. The most important stone, the cornerstone, of the building is Christ Jesus himself.
\v 21 Jesus is increasing his family of believers and fitting them together like a temple of stones is built and fit together, increasing as the Lord joins new believers to himself.
\v 22 Jesus is building you up together, both Jews and non-Jews, into one family in which God lives by means of his Spirit.

\v 19 So then, now you Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners. Instead you are fellow citizens with God's holy people and members of God's household.
\v 20 You have been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, and Christ Jesus himself was the cornerstone.
\v 21 In him the whole building fits together and grows as a temple in the Lord.
\v 22 It is in him that you also are being built together as a dwelling place for God in the Spirit.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **you Gentiles ... God's household** - Paul is again speaking of the spiritual condition of Gentiles after they become believers as he would speak about foreigners becoming citizens of a different nation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You have been built on the foundation** - Paul speaks of God's people as if they were a building. Christ is the cornerstone, the apostles are the foundation, and the believers are the structure. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You have been built** - This can be stated in the active tense. AT: "God has built you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the whole building fits together and grows as a temple** - Paul continues to speak of Christ's family as if it were a building. In the same way a builder fits stones together while building, so Christ is fitting us together. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **In him ... in the Lord ... in him** - "In Christ ... in the Lord Jesus ... in Christ" These metaphors express the strongest kind of relationship possible between Christ and those who believe in him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you also are being built together as a dwelling place for God in the Spirit** - This describes how believers are being put together to become a place where God will permanently live through the power of the Holy Spirit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **you also are being built together** - This can be stated as active. AT: "God is also building you together" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
