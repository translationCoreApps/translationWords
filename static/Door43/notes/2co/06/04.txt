\v 4 We have proved again and again that we are God's true servants. We endure great suffering, we face with courage people who hurt us, and we live through hard times.
\v 5 People have beaten us very badly; others have locked us up in prisons; we were the cause for people to riot; we have done hard physical labor; we have passed many long nights without sleep, and we have often gone with very little food.
\v 6 But in all this, our lives are pure, our knowledge is deep, and we are able to wait until God ends our suffering. We know how kind Christ is to us; we are filled with the Holy Spirit, and we love others.
\v 7 We live according to God's true Word, and we have God's power. By means of Christ, God has put us right with himself. This is the truth that we continuously believe; it is like armor that a soldier wears, and like weapons for both of his hands.

\v 4 Instead, we prove ourselves by all our actions, that we are God's servants. We are his servants in much endurance, affliction, distress, hardship,
\v 5 beatings, imprisonments, riots, in hard work, in sleepless nights, in hunger,
\v 6 in purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love.
\v 7 We are his servants in the word of truth, in the power of God. We have the armor of righteousness for the right hand and for the left.
