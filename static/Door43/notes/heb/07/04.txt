\v 4 You can realize how great this man Melchizedek was from the fact that Abraham, our famous ancestor, gave him a tenth of the best things he took from the battle with the kings.
\v 5 According to the laws God gave Moses, the descendants of Abraham's great-grandson Levi, who were priests, should take tithes from God's people who were their relatives, even though those people also were fellow descendants of Abraham.
\v 6 But this man Melchizedek, who was not among the descendants of Levi, received a tenth of everything from Abraham. He also blessed Abraham, the man to whom God promised many descendants.

\v 4 See how great this man was. Our ancestor Abraham gave a tenth of the things that he had taken in battle.
\v 5 On one hand, the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have a command from the law to collect tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, even though they, too, have come from Abraham's body.
\v 6 But on the other hand, Melchizedek, whose descent was not traced from them, received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him, the one who had the promises.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The writer states that the priesthood of Melchizedek is better than Aaron's priesthood and then reminds them that the priesthood of Aaron did not make anything perfect.

  * **this man was** - "Melchizedek was"
  * **On one hand ... But on the other hand** - These phrases are used to compare two things. Your language may have a way to emphasize that the author is making a comparison. Or you could leave out "On one hand" and translate "But on the other hand" simply as "But."
  * **the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood** - The author says this because not all of Levi's sons became priests. AT: "the descendants of Levi who became priests" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])
  * **from the people** - "from the people of Israel"
  * **from their brothers** - Here "brothers" means they are all related to each other through Abraham. AT: "from their relatives"
  * **they, too, have come from Abraham's body** - This is a way of saying that they were descendants of Abraham. AT: "they, too, are descendants of Abraham" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **whose descent was not traced from them** - "who was not a descendant of Levi"
  * **the one who had the promises** - The things that God promised to do for Abraham are spoken of as if they were objects that he could possess. AT: the one to whom God had spoken his promises" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
