  * **Connecting Statement:** - Bildad continues speaking.

  * **How then can man ... God? How can he who is born ... him?** - These two questions are used together to emphasize that it is impossible for a man to be good enough for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **How then can man be righteous with God?** - The implicit reaction is that he cannot. AT: "A man can never be righteous for God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **How can he who is born ... acceptable to him?** - The implicit reaction is that he cannot. AT: "He who is born of a woman cannot be clean or acceptable to him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

  * **How much less man ... a son of man, who is a worm** - These two lines say the same thing and are used together to emphasize that man is not perfect. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
