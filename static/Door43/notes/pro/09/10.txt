===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These verses finish the message of Wisdom.

  * **The fear of Yahweh** - Translate this phrase as in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:01:07|1:7]].
  * **through me your days will be multiplied** - This may be put into active form. AT: "I will multiply your days" or "I will cause you to live many more days" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **through me** - Wisdom, personified as a woman, continues to speak here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **your days will be multiplied, and years of life will be added to you** - These two phrases basically mean the same thing and are used to emphasize the great benefits wisdom has. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **years of life will be added to you** - Wisdom speaks of years of life as if they were physical objects. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will add years of life to you" or "I will add years to your life" or "I will enable you to live longer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **If you are wise ... and if you mock** - These two statements seem to mean that wise people gain advantages for themselves because of their wisdom, and mockers suffer because of their behavior.
  * **you will carry it** - This speaks of the consequence of one's bad behavior as if it were a heavy load that one had to carry on his back. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
