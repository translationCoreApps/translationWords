  * **this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "declaration" is expressed as the verb "solemnly said." AT: "this is what Yahweh of hosts has declared" or "this is what Yahweh of hosts has solemnly said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
