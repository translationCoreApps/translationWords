\v 18 In coming \add to God\add* you have not \add experienced things like what the Israelite people experienced\add* at Sinai Mountain. \add They\add* approached \add a mountain that God told them they\add* should not touch. \add They approached\add* a blazing fire, and it was gloomy and dark \f + \ft doublet \f*, and there was a hurricane\f + \ft Or: cyclone \f*.
\v 19 They heard a trumpet sounding and they heard \add God\add* speak. The result was that those who heard it pleaded for him not to speak to them like that again.
\v 20 When \add God\add* commanded them saying, "If \add a person or\add* even an animal touches this mountain, \add you\add* must \add kill him\f + \ft Or: it \f* by\add* throwing stones at him\f + \ft Or: it \f*," they were terrified.
\v 21 Truly, because Moses was terrified after seeing what happened \add on the mountain\add*, he said, "I am trembling because I am very afraid!"

\v 18 In coming to God, you have not experienced things like what the Israelite people experienced at Mount Sinai. They approached a mountain that God commanded them not to touch because he himself had come down to that mountain. They approached a blazing fire, and it was gloomy and dark, with a violent storm.
\v 19 They heard a trumpet sound, and they heard God speak a message. It was so powerful that they pleaded for him not to speak to them like that again.
\v 20 For God had commanded them, "If a person or even an animal touches this mountain, you must kill him." The people were terrified.
\v 21 Truly, because Moses was terrified after seeing what happened on the mountain, he said, "I am trembling because I am very afraid!"

\v 18 For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched, a mountain of burning fire, darkness, gloom, and storm.
\v 19 You have not come to a trumpet blast, nor to a voice that speaks words whose hearers begged that not another word be spoken to them.
\v 20 For they could not endure what was commanded: "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned."
\f + \ft Some older versions read, \fqa "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned or shot with an arrow." \fqb \f*
\v 21 So fearful was this sight that Moses said, "I am terrified and am trembling."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The author gives a contrast between what believers in Moses' time had while living under the law and what present day believers have after coming to Jesus under the new covenant. He illustrates the experience of the Israelites by describing how God appeared to them at Mount Sinai.
  * **General Information:** - The words "you" and "You" refer to the Hebrew believers to whom the author wrote. The word "they" refers to people of Israel after Moses led them out of Egypt. The first quotation comes from the writings of Moses. God reveals in this passage in Hebrews that Moses said he shook at seeing the mountain.

  * **For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched** - The implicit information can be stated explicitly. AT: "For you have not come, as the people of Israel came, to a mountain that can be touched" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **that can be touched** - This means that believers in Christ have not come to a physical mountain like Mount Sinai that a person can touch or see. This can be stated in active form. AT: "that a person can touch" or "that people can perceive with their senses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **You have not come to a trumpet blast** - "You have not come to a place where there is the loud sound of a trumpet"
  * **nor to a voice that speaks words whose hearers begged that not another word be spoken to them** - Here "voice" refers to someone speaking. The phrase "be spoken" can be stated in active form. AT: "or where God was speaking in such a way that those who heard him begged him not to speak another word to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **what was commanded** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "what God commanded" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **it must be stoned** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "you must stone it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
