\v 6 Achish liked what David suggested. So that day Achish gave to David the town of Ziklag. As a result, Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah since that time.

\v 5 David said to Achish, "If I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may live there: for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?"
\v 6 So Achish gave him Ziklag that day; that is why Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this very day.
\v 7 The number of days that David lived in the land of the Philistines was a full year and four months.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **If I have found favor in your eyes** - Here the eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:20:03|20:3]]. AT: "If I have pleased you" or "If you consider me favorably" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **let them give me a place** - Since Achish was the one who would "give," this is a metonym for "please give me a place." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **one of the cities in the country** - "one of the outlying towns" or "one of the towns outside the city"
  * **for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?** - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "I do not need to live in the city with you." or "I am not important enough to live here with you in the royal city." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **your servant** - David speaks as if he were another person to show that he respected Achish. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **Ziklag** - This is the name of a city in the southwest part of Judah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
