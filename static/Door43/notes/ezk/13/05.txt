===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Those prophets have not helped you Israelite people \f + \ft metonymy \f* to repair the places where the \add city\add* walls have been broken\f + \ft Or: crumbled \f*. That needs to be done in order that the walls will be strong at the time when I, Yahweh, \add send your enemies\add* to attack you.
\v 6 The visions and prophecies of those prophets are false. They say, 'Yahweh told me this,' but I have not sent them \add to you to be my prophets\add*. But they expect that what they prophesy will truly happen!
\v 7 They say that they have seen visions, but those visions are false, and the things that they prophesy are lies \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. They say, 'Yahweh told me this,' but I have told them nothing!

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Because you were listening to them, you have not repaired breeches or strengthened your walls. That needs to be done so that the walls will be strong when I, Yahweh, send your enemies to attack you.
\v 6 The visions and prophecies of those prophets are false. They say, 'Yahweh told me this.' I have not sent them to you to be my prophets, but you expect that what they prophesy will truly happen!
\v 7 They say that they have seen visions, but those visions are false, and the things that they prophesy are lies. They say, 'Yahweh told me this,' but I have told them nothing!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 You have not gone to the breaks in the wall around the house of Israel in order to repair it, in order to resist in battle on the day of Yahweh.
\v 6 The people have false visions and make false predictions, those who say, "Such and such is Yahweh's declaration." Yahweh has not sent them, but they nevertheless have made people hope that their messages would come true.
\v 7 Have you not had false visions and made false predictions, you who say, "Such and such is Yahweh's declaration" when I myself have not spoken?'

  * **resist in battle** - "defend"
  * **Have you not had false visions ... when I myself have not spoken?** - Yahweh uses a question to rebuke the false prophets. AT: "You have had false visions ... because I myself have not spoken." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **had false visions and made false predictions** - Since the false prophets have not really received a message from Yahweh, what they predict about the future is not true.
  * **Such and such** - This is a phrase used to refer to anything the prophet may have said. Your language may have another way to say this. "Yahweh told me this" (UDB)
