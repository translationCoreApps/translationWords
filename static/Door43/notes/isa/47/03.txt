===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to speak to Babylon about her downfall as if she were a queen who is humiliated. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])

  * **Your nakedness will be uncovered** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "You will be naked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **your shame will be seen** - Here the word "shame" is a euphemism for one's private parts. This can be translated in active form. AT: "people will see your shame" or "people will see your private parts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Our Redeemer** - "Our" refers to Isaiah and the people of Israel. See how you translated "Redeemer" in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:41:14|41:14]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
