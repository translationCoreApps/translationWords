===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he appeared in a different form** - Jesus was the person whom the "two of them" saw, but what they saw did not look like Jesus, so they did not know they were looking at Jesus.
  * **two of them** - two of "those who were with him" ([[:en:bible:notes:mrk:16:09|16:10]])
  * **they did not believe them** - The rest of the disciples did not believe what the two who had been walking in the country said.
