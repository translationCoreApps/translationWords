\v 21 Once again, Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice and pay his vow.
\v 22 But Hannah did not go; she had said to her husband, "I will not go until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, so that he may appear before Yahweh and live there forever."
\v 23 Elkanah her husband said to her, "Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only, may Yahweh confirm his word." So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she weaned him.
