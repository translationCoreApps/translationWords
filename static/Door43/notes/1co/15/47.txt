\v 47 The first man, Adam, belonged to the earth, for he was made from dust. But the second man, Christ, belongs to heaven.
\v 48 All those who are made from dust are just like Adam, the one who was made from dust. All those who belong to heaven are just like Christ, the man from heaven.
\v 49 Just as God made us like the man who was made from dust, so he will also make us be like the man from heaven.

<usfm>
\v 47 The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is from heaven.
\v 48 Just as the one made from dust is, so also are those who are made of the dust, and as the man of heaven is, so also are those who are of heaven.
\v 49 Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we will also bear the image of the man of heaven.
