===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

  * **Is it by your wisdom ... for the south?** - Yahweh uses this question to prove that Job is not as great as Yahweh. The implicit answer to this question is "no." AT: "It is not by your wisdom ... for the south." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **stretches out his wings for the south** - Here the stretching out of his wings refers to flying. AT: "flies to the south" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for the south** - In the biblical geography, birds fly south during the winter in order to live in warmer climates.
