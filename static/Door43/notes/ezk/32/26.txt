\v 26 \add Corpses of\add* soldiers of Meshech and Tubal will be there, surrounded by the graves of a huge crowd of their people. While they were alive, they also caused people in many places to be terrified. They were all godless people who were killed by swords because while they were alive, they also caused people in many places \f + \ft hyperbole \f* to be terrified. They will surely \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* lie there, along with other godless soldiers who have died, whose shields were buried with their corpses, whose swords were placed on their skulls in the graves.
\v 27 While they were alive, they had caused many people in the land to be terrified, so they will be punished for their sins.

\v 26 The dead of all the soldiers of the lands of Meshech and Tubal will be there, surrounded by the graves of a huge crowd. While they were alive, they also caused people in many places to be terrified. They are uncircumcised people whom their enemies will have killed.
\v 27 They will not lie there beside the uncircumcised warriors who have gone to the grave highly honored with their shields over their bodies and their swords under their heads. While they were alive, they terrified many people on the earth.

\q
\v 26 Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitudes are there! Their graves surround them.
\q All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword, because they had brought their terrors on the land of the living.
\q
\v 27 They do not lie with the fallen warriors of the uncircumcised who have gone down to Sheol
\q with all their weapons of war, and with their swords placed under their heads
\q and their iniquities over their bones. For they were the terror of warriors in the land of the living.
