===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **You must not detest an Edomite** - "Do not hate an Edomite"
  * **for he is your brother** - "because he is your relative"
  * **you must not abhor an Egyptian** - "do not hate an Egyptian"
  * **The descendants of the third generation that are born to them may belong to the assembly of Yahweh** - This "third" is the ordinal number for three. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "If an Edomite or an Egyptian comes to live in the Israelite community, his grandchildren may become full members of that community" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
