====== Jeremiah 35 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The Rechabites ==

The action of the Rechabites was supposed to contrast with the actions of the Jews. The Rechabites obeyed their ancestors' commands while living in Canaan, while Judah did not obey Yahweh's commands. Because of this Yahweh preserves their people group. It may be helpful to know the Rechabites' history found in the book of Judges.
