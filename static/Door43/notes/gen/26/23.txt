\v 23 From there Isaac went up to Beersheba.
\v 24 The first night that he was there, Yahweh appeared to him and said, "I am God, whom your father Abraham worshiped. Do not be afraid of anything. I will help you and bless you, and because of what I promised my servant Abraham, I will greatly increase the number of your descendants."
\v 25 So Isaac built a stone altar there and offered a sacrifice to worship Yahweh. He set up their tents there, and his servants started to dig a well.
