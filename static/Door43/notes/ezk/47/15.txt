\v 15 These will be the boundaries of the land:
\li1 On the north side, it will extend from the Mediterranean Sea east along the road to Hethlon, past Lebo-Hamath to Zedad,
\li1
\v 16 Berothah, and Sibraim, which is on the border between Damascus and Hamath, as far as Hazer-Hatticon, which is on the border of the Hauran \add region\add*.
\v 17 So the boundary will extend from the Mediterranean Sea to Hazar-Enan on the border between Hamath to the north and Damascus to the south. That will be the northern boundary.

\v 15 This will be the boundary of the land on the north side from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon, and then to Zedad. 
\f + \ft The Hebrew text reads \fqa by way of Hethlon, and then to Zedad \fqa* , but some modern versions imitate 48:1 and add \fqa Lebo Hamath \fqa* . \f*
\v 16 Then the boundary will go to Berothah, to Sibraim, which is between Damascus and Hamath, and then to Hazer Hatticon, which is beside the boundary of Hauran.
\v 17 So the boundary will go from the sea to Hazar Enon on the border with Damascus and Hamath to the north. This will be the north side.
