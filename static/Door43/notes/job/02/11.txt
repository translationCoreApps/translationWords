  * **Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite** - Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar are men's names. Teman was a city in Edom. Shuhites are the decedents of Abraham and Keturah (see Genesis [[:en:bible:notes:gen:25:01|25:1]]). Naamah was a city in Canaan. (See: [[ en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **set a time** - AT: "agreed upon a time" 
  * **to mourn with him and to comfort him** - Here the words "mourn with" and "comfort" share similar meanings. The friends try to comfort Job by mourning with him. AT: "to grieve with Job in order to help ease his suffering." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
