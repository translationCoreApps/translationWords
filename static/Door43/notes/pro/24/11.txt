====== Proverbs 24:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 \add If it is unjustly decided\add* that someone must be executed, try hard to rescue them \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1
\v 12 If you say, "I did not know anything about it, \add so it is not my concern\f + \ft Or: I did not try to help him \f*\add*,"
\q2 remember that God knows what we have done,
\q1 and he knows what we were thinking [IDI, RHQ],
\q2 and he will certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* repay us as we deserve for what we have done or for not doing what we should have done.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Rescue the ones who are being carried away to the slaughter;
\q2 they stagger and fall—hold them back from the one who would kill them.
\q1
\v 12 If you say, "I did not know that those people needed any help," then think about this:
\q2 God knows why we do everything, so he also knows why you said those people needed no help.
\q2 God sees everything you do in this life, so he certainly understands why you said that about those people.
\q2 He will certainly pay you back—and everyone else, too—for the harm they have done.


\q1

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 Rescue those who are being taken away to death
\q and hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter.
\q
\v 12 If you say, "Behold, we knew nothing about this,"
\q does not the one who weighs the heart understand what you are saying?
\q The one who guards your life, does he not know it?
\q Will God not give to each one what he deserves?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These verses continue the "thirty sayings" ([[:en:bible:notes:pro:22:20|22:20]]).

  * **those who are being taken away** - These words can be translated in active form. AT: "those whom they are taking away," where "they" could be anyone, but are probably government officials. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **taken away** - Another possible meaning is "dragged away."
  * **staggering** - walking unsteadily and almost falling. This word would also describe the way a person walks when he is being dragged away.
  * **the slaughter** - The abstract noun "slaughter" can be translated as a verb. The writer speaks as if those who take them away think of them as no better than animals. If your language has a word for killing animals that would fit here, you might want to use it. AT: "where people will kill them as they would kill animals" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **If you say, "Behold, ... this," does** - The writer is answering something that the reader may wrongly be thinking. AT: "You may say, 'Behold, ... this,' but does"
  * **Behold, we** - "Listen to us! We" or "But we" or "We have done nothing wrong, because we"
  * **does not the one who weighs the heart understand what you are saying?** - The writer assumes the readers know the answer and asks this for emphasis. AT: "the one who weighs the heart understands what you are saying." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the one who** - The writer expects the reader to know that "the one" is Yahweh. AT: "Yahweh, who" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **weighs the heart** - The word "heart" is a metonym for what a person thinks and desires. The writer speaks as if what a person thinks and desires were a physical object that a person could weigh, and weighing an object is a metaphor for looking closely at something to see how good it is. AT: "knows how good what people really think and desire is" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The one who guards your life, does he not know it?** - The writer assumes the readers know the answer and asks this for emphasis. AT: "The one who guards your life knows it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Will God not give to each one what he deserves?** - The writer assumes the readers know the answer and asks this for emphasis. AT: "God will give to each one what he deserves." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
