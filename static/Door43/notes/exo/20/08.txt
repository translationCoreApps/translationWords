====== Exodus 20:8-11 ======

<usfm>
\v 8 Do not forget that the seventh day \add of every week\add* is mine, so dedicate those days to me.
\v 9 There are six days each week for you to do all your work,
\v 10 but the seventh day is a rest day, a day dedicated to me, Yahweh God, the one whom you \add should worship\add*. On that day you must not do any work. You and your sons and daughters and your male and female slaves must not work. You must not even force your livestock to work, and you must not allow foreigners to work, those who are living in your country.
\v 11 I, Yahweh, created the sky, the earth, the ocean, and everything that is in them, in six days. Then I stopped my work of creating everything, and rested on the seventh day. That is the reason that I, Yahweh, have blessed the rest day and set it apart \add to be a sacred\f + \ft Or: special \f* day\add*.

\v 8 Do not forget that the seventh day of every week belongs to me, so keep those days only for me.
\v 9 There are six days each week for you to do all your work,
\v 10 but the seventh day is a day of rest, a day dedicated to me, Yahweh your God, the one whom you should worship. On that day you must not do any work. You and your sons and daughters and your male and female slaves must not work. You must not even force your livestock to work, and you must not allow foreigners to work, those strangers who are living in your country.
\v 11 I, Yahweh, created the sky, the earth, the ocean, and everything that is in them in six days. Then I stopped my work of creating everything and rested on the seventh day. That is the reason that I, Yahweh, have blessed the rest day and set it apart to be a sacred day.

\v 8 Remember the Sabbath day, to set it apart to me.
\v 9 You must labor and do all your work for six days.
\v 10 But the seventh day is a Sabbath for me, Yahweh your God. On it you must not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor the foreigner who is within your gates.
\v 11 For in six days I, Yahweh, made the heavens, earth, and sea, and everything that is in them, and then rested on the seventh day. Therefore I, Yahweh, blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart to myself.
