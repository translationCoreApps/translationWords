===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to rebuke Job by asking him questions.

  * **Will you actually say that I am unjust?** - The word "actually" indicates that Yahweh is surprised that Job would say that Yahweh is unjust and that Job should make sure that he really wants to say that. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I am surprised that you are saying I am unjust." or "You should be sure that you want to say that I am unjust, because that is what you are saying." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Will you condemn me so you may claim you are right?** - This can be translated as a statement. AT: "You are condemning me so you can claim that you are innocent." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **arm like God's** - The arm is a metonym for the strength in the arm. AT: "strength like God's strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Can you thunder with a voice like him?** - This can be translated as a statement. AT: "You certainly cannot cause thunder with your voice the way God does with his." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a voice like him** - "a voice the way he does." Most translations read, "a voice like his voice" (see UDB).
