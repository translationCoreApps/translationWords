  * **There is a generation whose teeth are swords, and their jawbones are like knives, so they may devour the poor ... and the needy** - The people of the generation who speak very harmful things is spoken of as if they were wild animals with teeth and jawbones made of swords and knives, and they eat the poor and needy.
