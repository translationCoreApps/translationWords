===== translationNotes: =====

  * **twenty-six thousand** - "26,000" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **seven hundred** - "700" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **left-handed** - A left-handed person is someone who is more skilled their left hand than with their right hand.
  * **could sling a stone at a hair and not miss** - Here "at a hair and not miss" is an probably exaggeration to show how well they could aim. These two negative words together "not miss" emphasize a positive idea. They can be stated in positive form. AT: "could sling a stone very accurately" or "could sling a stone very precisely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
