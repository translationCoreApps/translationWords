\v 24 When Jesus saw how sad the man was, he too became very sorrowful. He said, "It is very difficult for those who are wealthy to agree for God to rule over them."
\v 25 In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for rich people to let God rule their lives."

\v 24 Then Jesus, seeing him, became very sad \f + \ft Scholars are divided whether the phrase: "[he] became very sad," should be included here. Compare vs 23. \fqa \f* and said, "How difficult it is for those who are rich to enter the kingdom of God!
\v 25 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **How difficult it is ... kingdom of God!** - This is an exclamation, and not a question. AT: "It is so very hard ... kingdom of God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclamations]])
  * **a camel to go through a needle's eye** - It is impossible for a camel to fit through the eye of a needle. Therefore, it appears that Jesus may have been using hyperbole to mean it is extremely difficult for a rich man to enter God's kingdom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **needle's eye** - The needle's eye is the hole in a sewing needle through which the thread is passed.
