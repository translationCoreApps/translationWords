<usfm>
\v 3 All the people who will remain in Jerusalem, who did not die when the enemy destroyed Jerusalem,
will belong to the Lordâ€”all those whose names are listed among those who live there.
\v 4 That will happen when the Lord washes away the guilt of the women of Jerusalem,
 and when he stops the violence on the streets of Jerusalem by punishing the people of Jerusalem.
 When he does that, it will be like a fire to burn up all the impure things.

<usfm>
\v 3 Then, he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, will be called holy, 
every one who is recorded as living in Jerusalem,
\v 4 when the Lord will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and will have cleansed the blood stains from Jerusalem's midst, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning fire.

  * **will be called holy** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Lord will call them holy" or "will belong to the Lord" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **every one who is recorded as living in Jerusalem** - "every one whose name is on the list of the people who live in Jerusalem"
  * **when the Lord will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion** - This compares removing sin with washing away filth. AT: "after the Lord removes the sins of the daughters of Zion as someone washes away filth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the daughters of Zion** - Possible meanings are 1) the women of Jerusalem or 2) the people of Jerusalem.
