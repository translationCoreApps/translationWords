====== Jeremiah 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 5:1-31, which is an extended quotation.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===
== Hyperbole ==
It is possible that Yahweh is speaking in hyperbole when he states, "If you can find a man or anyone who is acting justly and trying to act faithfully, then I will forgive Jerusalem." The purpose of this is to show how evil Jerusalem had become. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]], [[:en:obe:kt:justice]], [[:en:obe:kt:faith]], [[:en:obe:kt:forgive]] and [[:en:obe:kt:evil]])

== Rhetorical questions ==
Yahweh asks several rhetorical questions in this chapter. This is intended to show Jeremiah the justness of his actions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
