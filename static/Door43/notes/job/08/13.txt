\q1
\v 14 The things they confidently expect to happen do not happen;
\q2 things they trust will help them are as weak as a spider's web.
\q1
\v 15 If they lean against a house, it falls on them;
\q2 if they cling to things for safety, those things will not remain firm.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 So also are the paths of all who forget God,
\q the hope of the godless will perish.
\q
\v 14 His confidence will break apart,
\q and his trust is as weak as a spider's web.
\q
\v 15 he leans on his house, but it will not support him;
\q he takes hold of it, but it does not stand.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These verses continue Bildad's speech. In verses 14-15, the writer uses parallelism, conveying a single idea with two different statements to emphasize the destruction of those who do not build their lives on the teachings of their ancestors. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **So also are the paths of all who forget God** - "Walking a path" is a common idiom that refers to a person's life and its direction. It often refers to whether people are following God's way or their own. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **his trust is as weak as a spider's web** - Here Bildad compares the lives of the godless to a spider's web; the slightest force will break both. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **he takes hold of it** - "he will try to support it"
