== Priests ==
The priests worked on rebuilding the city. Normally, the priests were exempt from this type of work. Because they helped, it emphasizes that this is a holy work and something done for Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:priest]], [[:en:obe:kt:holy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== Cooperation ==
Everyone worked on this project. Many names are mention to emphasize the cooperation between the different families. Each was given a section of the wall to rebuild.
