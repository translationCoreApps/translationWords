===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling Moses where each tribe and its army will camp around the tent of meeting. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])

  * **under their standard** - The "standards" were four larger groups that the tribes were divided into. Each standard was commanded to camp together. The standards was represented by a banner. See how you translated "standards" in [[:en:bible:notes:num:02:01|2:2]].
  * **Elizur son of Shedeur** - Translate this man's name the same way that you did in [[:en:bible:notes:num:01:04|1:5]].
  * **46,500** - This modifies men. AT: "46,500 men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
