=== Structure and formatting ===

2 Kings is a continuation of 1 Kings.

The story of Elijah continues in this chapter.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== God's sovereignty ==
God is in control of the future. King Ahaziah sent messengers to ask the Philistine god if he would recover from his fall, but this god does not know the future. Because he asked another god instead of Yahweh, Elijah sent the messengers to tell Ahaziah that he would not recover. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical question ==
Elijah rebuked the king with a rhetorical question: "Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
