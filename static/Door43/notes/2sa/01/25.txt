===== translationNotes: =====

  * **How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle** - This phrase is repeated in verse 27 to emphasize that Israel's best warriors are dead. AT: "The mighty men have died in battle"
  * **the mighty** - Here "mighty" is plural and may refer to only Saul and Jonathan, or to all of the soldiers of Israel. AT: "the mighty warriors" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **have fallen** - This is a polite way to say "have died." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **Jonathan is killed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Jonathan has died in battle" or "The enemy has killed Jonathan" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **on your high places** - David continues to address this part of the song to the mountains of Gilboa as he started in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:01:21|1:21]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **my brother Jonathan** - Here "brother" is used in the sense of a very close friend. 
  * **Your love to me was wonderful, exceeding the love of women** - Here "love" is used in the sense of friendship and loyalty. Jonathan's loyalty to David was even greater than the loyalty a woman has for her husband and children.
