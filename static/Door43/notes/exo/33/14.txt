\v 14 Yahweh answered, "My own presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
\v 15 Moses said to him, "If your presence does not go with us, do not take us up from here.
\v 16 For otherwise, how will it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Will it not only be if you go with us so that I and your people are different from all the other peoples that are on the surface of the earth?"
