====== Mark 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and Format ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 4:12, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

4:3-10 forms one parable. The parable is explained in 4:14-23. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Parables ==
There are many parables in this chapter. They are a way Jesus teaches about the kingdom of God. Jesus explains their meaning to the disciples, but not to the crowds. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Implicit knowledge ==

Implicit knowledge is needed in several parts of this chapter. The UDB can be quite effective in helping the reader to understand unknown figures. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
