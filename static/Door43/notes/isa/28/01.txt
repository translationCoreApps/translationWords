====== Isaiah 28:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Terrible things will happen to \add Samaria city, the capital of Israel\add*!
\q2 It is on a hill above a fertile valley;
\q1 the people who live there, who get drunk by drinking too much wine, are very proud;
\q2 it is a beautiful and glorious city,
\q2 but some day that beauty will disappear like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a flower that wilts and dries up.
\q1
\v 2 Listen to this: Yahweh will cause a great army to attack it.
\q2 Their soldiers will be like \f + \ft simile \f* a huge hailstorm or a very strong wind;
\q1 they will be everywhere, like the water of a huge flood,
\q2 and they will smash to the ground \add the buildings in Samaria\add*.

\q1
\v 1 Woe to the proud garland crown that is worn by each of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of its glorious beauty,
\q1 the garland that is set on the head of the lush Valley of those who are overcome with wine!
\q1
\v 2 Behold, the Lord sends one who is mighty and strong; like a storm of hail and a destructive windstorm,
\q1 like a driving rain and overflowing waters;
\q1 and he will throw each garland crown down to the ground.

  * **Woe to the proud garland ... on the head of the lush Valley of those who are overcome with wine** - A "garland" is a crown made of flowers. Here it represents the city of Samaria, the capital of Israel, which sits above a fertile valley. Samaria and its people being destroyed is spoken of as if the flowers in the garland will grow old and stop being beautiful. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Behold** - "Listen" or "Pay attention"
  * **who are overcome with wine** - "who are drunk with wine"
  * **the Lord sends one who is mighty and strong** - Here "one" refers to a mighty king who also represents his powerful army. AT: "the Lord sends a king with his powerful army" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **storm of hail** - A "storm of hail" or hailstorm happens when hard pieces of ice fall from the sky. Here it is a simile that refers to the enemy army that Yahweh will send to destroy the people of Samaria. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **he will throw each garland crown down to the ground** - The king and his powerful army destroying the people of Samaria and their city is spoken of as if the king will throw the people's garlands onto the ground. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
