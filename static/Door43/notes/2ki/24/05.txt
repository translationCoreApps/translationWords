  * **are they not written ... Judah?** - This is written as a rhetorical question because at the time this was written people were already aware of this information. This can be written as a statement. It can be translated in active form. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:08:22|8:23]]. AT: "they are indeed written ... Judah." or "you can find them ... Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **slept with his ancestors** - "died and was buried along with his ancestors" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
