===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Bildad continues to use parallelism in each of these verses to emphasize that their ancestors agree with the things Bildad is telling Job. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **give your attention to what our ancestors learned** - "study carefully what our ancestors discovered" or "consider the things our forefathers learned"
  * **our days on earth are a shadow** - The shortness of life is spoken of as if it were a shadow which quickly disappears. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Will they not teach you and tell you? Will they not speak words from their hearts?** - Bildad uses these rhetorical questions to rebuke Job for not agreeing with Bildad and the ancestors. They can be translated as statements. AT: "They will teach you and tell you and speak what they sincerely believe." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **from their hearts** - Here the word "hearts" represents their inner beliefs. AT: "that they sincerely believe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
