\v 12 Yahweh has declared this:
\q1 "When a lion attacks a sheep,
\q2 sometimes a shepherd will be able to snatch from the lion's mouth
\q2 only two legs or an ear of the sheep.
\q1 Similarly, only a few people from Samaria will escape,

\q
\v 11 Therefore, this is what the Lord Yahweh says,
\q "An enemy will surround the land.
\q He will pull down your strongholds
\q and plunder your fortresses."
\q
\v 12 This is that Yahweh says,
\q "As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion
\q two legs only,
\q or a piece of an ear,
\q so will the people of Israel be rescued who live in Samaria,
\q with only the corner of a couch,
\q or just a corner of a bed."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **couch** - a soft chair big enough to lie down on
  * **with only the corner of a couch, or just a corner of a bed** - This passage in Hebrew is difficult to understand, and some modern versions interpret it differently. The interpretation of the UDB, adopted by some modern versions, uses a simile. It means that only a few Israelites will be saved, just as a house owner might save only a few parts of furniture when his house catches on fire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
