====== Jeremiah 10 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 10:1-25, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Yahweh's power ==
This chapter contrasts the great power of Yahweh with the powerlessness of any other false god. It is intended to question why the Jews would worship any other god. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]])
