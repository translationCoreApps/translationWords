\v 23 But his wife said, "No, we will not die, because if Yahweh intended to kill us, he would not have accepted the burned offering and the grain offering. And he would not have appeared to us and told us the wonderful thing that would happen to us, and he would not have performed this miracle."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He would not have shown us all these things, nor at this time would he have let us hear such things** - Manoah's wife said basically the same thing twice for emphasis. These two statements can be combined. AT: "He would not have told us what he wanted us to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
