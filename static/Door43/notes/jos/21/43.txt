\v 43 It was in this way that Yahweh assigned to the Israelite people all the land that he had promised to give to their ancestors. The Israelite people took control of these areas and settled down in them.
\v 44 Just as he had promised their ancestors, Yahweh allowed them to have peace with the enemies that surrounded them. None of their enemies defeated them. Yahweh helped Israel defeat all their enemies.

\p
\v 43 So Yahweh gave to Israel all the land that he swore to give to their ancestors. The Israelites took possession of it and settled there.
\v 44 Then Yahweh gave them rest on every side, just as he had sworn to their ancestors. Not one of their enemies could defeat them. Yahweh gave all their enemies into their hand.
\v 45 Not one thing among all the good promises that Yahweh had spoken to the house of Israel failed to come true. All of them came to be.
