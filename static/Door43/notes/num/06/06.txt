Your long hair \f + \ft metonymy \f* shows that you belong to me in a special way, so you must do what you have solemnly promised \add and not cut your hair\add*.

\v 6 During all the time that he separates himself to Yahweh, he must not come near a dead body.
\v 7 He must not make himself unclean even for his father, mother, brother, or sister, if they die. This is because he is separated to God, as everyone can see by his long hair.
\v 8 During all the time of his separation he is holy, reserved for Yahweh.
