===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But Yahweh was gracious to Israel, and had compassion on them and concern for them** - It may be helpful to divide this sentence into shorter parts. AT: "But Yahweh was very kind to the Israelite people. He helped them" (UDB)
  * **So Yahweh did not destroy them** - Yahweh's covenant is the reason he did not destroy Israel. This can be made explicit. AT: "This is the reason that Yahweh did not destroy them" or "Because of his covenant, Yahweh did not destroy them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **has not driven them away from his presence** - Yahweh's rejection is spoken of as if he had physically driven Israel away from where he was. AT: "has not rejected them" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
