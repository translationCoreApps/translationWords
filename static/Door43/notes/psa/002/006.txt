===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I myself** - Yahweh is emphasizing that he, and not someone else, has anointed his king.
  * **anointed my king** - "appointed my king to rule"
  * **I will announce a decree of Yahweh** - The person saying this is the king. This can be stated clearly. AT: "The king says 'I will announce a decree of Yahweh'"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He said to me** - "Yahweh said to me"
  * **You are my son! This day I have become your father** - Among many peoples in that part of the world then, men could decide to legally adopt children, who would become their heirs. Here Yahweh adopts a man and makes him king of Israel. AT: "I make you my son. This day I have become your father" or "Now you are my son and am your father"
