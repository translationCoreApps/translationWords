===== translationNotes: =====

  * **their brother Benjamin** - Here "their brother Benjamin" refers to the surviving descendants of Benjamin. AT: "the surviving Benjamites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **one tribe has been cut off from Israel** - The destruction of the tribe of Benjamin is spoken of as if it had been cut off from Israel by a knife. AT: "one tribe has been removed." This was an exaggeration because 600 men were still left. However, the Benjamin women had been killed, so the future of the tribe was in question. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Who will provide wives for those who are left, since we have made a promise to Yahweh that we will not let any of them marry our daughters?** - The Israelites wanted to provide wives for the few surviving Benjamites, but their promise at Mizpah prevented them from doing that.
