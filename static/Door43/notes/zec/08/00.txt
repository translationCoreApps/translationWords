====== Zechariah 08 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is a series of sayings from Yahweh of hosts. Each saying is an encouraging note for those returning from the exile to the land of Judah and Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:yahwehofhosts]])

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 8:2-13, which is an extended quotation.
