===== translationNotes: =====
 
  * **The word of Yahweh came** - This idiom means God spoke. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:06:11|6:11]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke his message" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Although I exalted you** - This is God's message that Jehu was to give to Baasha. The word "you" refers to Baasha.
  * **I exalted you out of the dust** - "I raised you out of the dust." Being in the dust on the ground represents not being important. Exalting someone represents making him important. AT: "I raised you from a very unimportant position" or "when you had no power or influence over people, I made you important" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you have walked in the way of Jeroboam** - Walking represents behaving. Jeroboam and Baasha both sinned. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. AT: "you have done the same things that Jeroboam did" or "you have sinned as Jeroboam sinned" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
