\v 21 Then he brought me to the outer courtyard and he led me past the four corners of that courtyard, and I saw that in at every corner of the courtyard there was a another court.
\v 22 In the four corners of the outer courtyard there were four small courtyards, forty cubits long and thirty wide. There the same dimensions for all four of the courtyards.

\v 23 There was a row made of stone all around the four of them, and cooking hearths were under the stone row.
