\q
\v 7 I have abandoned my house; I have forsaken my inheritance.
\q I have given my own beloved people into the hands of her enemies.

\v 8 My inheritance has become to me like a lion in a thicket;
\q she sets herself against me with her own voice, so I hate her.
\q

\q Go and gather all the wild beasts and bring them to devour her.
