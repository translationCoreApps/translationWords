===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Bildad continues to describe the wicked person.

  * **The steps of his strength will be made short** - This speaks of the wicked person suddenly experiencing disaster as if he no longer had strength  to walk. AT: "It will be like he no long has the strength to walk" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **his own plans will cast him down** - "his own advice makes him fall down." This speaks of the wicked person undergoing disaster as if he feel down. AT: "his own plans will led him into disaster" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For he will be thrown into a net by his own feet; he will walk into a pitfall** - "His own feet will lead him into a net." Bildad uses this image to say that the way that a wicked person lives his life leads him to sudden disaster. AT: "It will be as though he led himself into a net, as if he walked right into a pitfall" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a net** - cords or ropes that people weave together to create a mesh. People used nets to catch animals.
  * **a pitfall** - a pit that has branches and leaves over it so that an animal will walk onto the branches and leaves and fall into the pit
