  * **I stirred Cyrus** - Yahweh speaks of causing Cyrus to act as if it were stirring him from slumber. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will smooth out all his paths** - Yahweh speaks of removing obstacles and causing Cyrus to be successful as if he were making the paths smooth on which Cyrus walks. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He will build my city** - This refers to Jerusalem.
  * **and not for price nor bribe** - Here the words "price" and "bribe" share similar meanings. Cyrus will not do these things for financial gain. AT: "and he will not do these things for money" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
