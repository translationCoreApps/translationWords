====== Job 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. This chapter is a continuation of the advice of Job's friend, Eliphaz. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Eliphaz's advice ==
Eliphaz tells Job to curse Yahweh. The advice Eliphaz gives to Job is bad advice. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:curse]])

== Sickness and sin ==
In the ancient Near East, it was common to believe that a person's illness was caused by sin. It was seen as the punishment of a god. While Yahweh may punish people because of their sin, not all sicknesses were caused by sin. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:believe]], [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
Eliphaz uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter in order to try to convince Job that he is wrong. These questions help to build Eliphaz's argument. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
