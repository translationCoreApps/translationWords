====== 1 Corinthians 08 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 8:6, which is a quotation from the Old Testament. 

Chapters 8-10 form a single unit, answering the question: "Is it alright to eat meat that has been sacrificed to an idol?"

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

==Meat sacrificed to idols ==
Paul answers their question by saying idols are gods that do not really exist, therefore there is nothing wrong with the meat. However, someone who does not understand a Christian's freedom to eat this meat may see a Christian eating and be encouraged to eat the meat as an act of worship to the idol.
