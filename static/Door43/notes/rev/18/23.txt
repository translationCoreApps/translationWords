\v 23 No lamp will ever again shine there. There will never again be the happy voices of any bridegroom and his bride. God will destroy your city because your merchants were the most important men in the world. You used witchcraft to deceive people of all people-groups.
\v 24 You are also responsible for killing the prophets and others of God's people. Indeed, you are guilty of every murder committed on the earth!"
