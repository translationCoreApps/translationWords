===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the regulation** - "the instruction" or "the rule"
  * **the surrounding border** - The word "border" probably refers to the wall that goes all the way around the temple.
  * **most holy** - "absolutely holy"
  * **Behold!** - The word "Behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. It can also be translated as "Indeed!"
