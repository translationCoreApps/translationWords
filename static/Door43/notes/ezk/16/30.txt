===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that when you did all those things, acting like a bold prostitute, you were showing that you could not control your lust and would do anything, no matter how promiscuous, that you wanted to to satisfy your desires.
\v 31 But when you built the houses on the hills to worship idols in every city square, you were not really like a prostitute because prostitutes charge money. You refused to take money for what you did!

\v 30 How sick is your heart—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—that you would do all these things, deeds of a shameless prostitute?
\v 31 You have built your high places at the head of every street and made your vaulted chamber in every public place. Yet you were not like a prostitute because you refused to take payment.

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem and the people of Israel as his unfaithful wife.

  * **How sick is your heart ... that you would do all these things, deeds of a shameless prostitute?** - Yahweh asks the rhetorical question in order to rebuke Jerusalem. AT: "Your heart must be very sick ... that you would do all these things, deeds of a shameless prostitute!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **How sick is your heart** - Here the word "heart" represents the will and emotions Yahweh speaks of her inability to control her desires as if her heart were sick. AT: "How weak-willed are you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **at the head of every street** - Yahweh speaks of the beginning of a street as if it were its head. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:16:25|16:25]]. AT: "at the beginning of every street" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **made your vaulted chamber** - Possible meanings are that she built a place where 1) she could worship her idols or 2) she could practice her prostitution. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:16:23|16:24]].
