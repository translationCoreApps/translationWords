====== 1 Corinthians 08:11-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 As a result, you who know that \add idols are not really alive\add*, might cause that fellow believer, one for whom Christ died, to be ruined \add spiritually\add*\f + \ft Or: to stop believing \add in Christ\add* \f*.
\v 12 By sinning against your fellow believer by causing him to do something that he thinks God does not allow us to do, \add it is as though\add* you are sinning against Christ himself!
\v 13 So if \add I, Paul, think that by\add* eating a certain food I might cause a fellow believer to be ruined spiritually, I will never eat such food again. I do not want to cause any fellow believer to be ruined spiritually\f + \ft Or: to stop believing in Christ \f*. \add And you should\add* \add do as I do\f + \ft Or: imitate my example\add* \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 As a result, if your weaker brother or sister sees you eat meat offered to idols because you have freedom in your mind to eat that food but they did not have the same freedomâ€”you by acting as a free person could destroy your fellow believer for whom Christ died.
\v 12 So, you sin against your weaker brothers and sisters when you encourage them to do something that their sense of right and wrong tells them not to do. This is sinning against Christ.
\v 13 Therefore, if my brother or sister are unable to serve God well because they have seen me eat something, I will never eat meat again! I do not want to do anything that causes them to fall.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 So because of your understanding about the true nature of idols, the weaker one, the brother for whom Christ died, is destroyed.
\v 12 Thus, when you sin against your brothers and wound their weak consciences, you sin against Christ. 
\v 13 Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not cause my brother to fall.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **your understanding** - Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so the word "your" here is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **the weaker one ... is destroyed** - The brother or sister who is not strong in his or her faith will sin or lose his or her faith.
  * **Therefore** - "Because what I have just said is true"
  * **if food causes** - "Food" here is a metonym for the person eating the food. AT: "if I cause by eating" or "if I, because of what I eat, cause" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
