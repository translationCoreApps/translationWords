\v 25 As soon as Jehu \add and Jonadab\add* had finished killing the animals that would be completely burned to be an offering to Baal, \add they went outside and\add* said to the guards and officers, "Go in and kill all of them! Do not allow any of them to escape!" So the guards and officers went in and killed them all with their swords. Then they dragged their corpses outside the temple. Then they went into the inner room of the temple,
\v 26 and they carried out the sacred pillar of Baal that was there, and they burned it.
\v 27 So they destroyed that pillar that honored Baal, and then they burned down the temple, and made it a latrine. And it is still a latrine!
\p
\v 28 That is how Jehu got rid of the worship of Baal in Israel.

\v 25 So then as soon as Jehu finished offering the burnt offering, he said to the guard and to the captains, "Go in and kill them. Let no one come out." So they killed them with the edge of the sword, and the guard and the captains threw them out and went into the inner room of the house of Baal.
\v 26 They dragged out the stone pillars that were in the house of Baal, and they burned them.
\v 27 Then they broke down the pillar of Baal, and destroyed the house of Baal and made it a latrine, which it is to this day.
\v 28 That is how Jehu destroyed Baal worship from Israel.
