====== Ephesians 05:13-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 But when \add God's people rebuke those evil people about their deeds, it will be clear\f + \ft Or: evident \f* how evil their deeds really are, just like\add* everything exposed to the light becomes visible \f + \ft Or:as light ( metaphor ) reveals everything \add that we cannot see in the darkness\add* \f*.
\v 14 \add Just like something on which a light shines reflects that light\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add whoever has learned God's truth reveals that truth to others\add*. That is why \add we believers\add* say this:
\q You who are not aware of your sins, become aware of them \f + \ft metaphor \f*!
\q It is as though you are sound asleep, so wake up!
\q Be like dead people who are becoming alive again!
\q Christ will cause you to know God's truth, just like a light \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\q that shines causes people to know what is in the darkness.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Everything that light exposes can then be clearly seen and better understood
\v 14 because the light shows what it truly is. It is like when God's word explains the sins that destroy people and Jesus who forgives and renews people. So believers say, 
\q "Wake up from your sleep 
\q and arise from living like dead people. 
\q Christ will enable you to understand 
\q his forgiveness and new life."

\p
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 All things, when they are revealed by the light, are exposed.
\v 14 For everything revealed is illuminated. Therefore it says, 
\q "Awake, you sleeper, 
\q and rise from the dead ones, 
\q and Christ will shine on you."
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - It is unknown if this quotation is a combination of quotations from the prophet Isaiah or a quotation from a hymn sung by the believers.

  * **everything revealed is illuminated** - "people can clearly see everything that comes into the light." While this is a metaphor for how the word of God shows people's actions to be good or bad, you should translate this literally. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Awake, you sleeper, and rise from the dead ones** - Possible meanings are 1) Paul is addressing unbelievers who need to wake up from being dead spiritually just as a person who has died must come alive again in order to respond. or 2) Paul is addressing the Ephesian believers and using death as a metaphor for their spiritual weakness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you sleeper ... shine on you** - These instances of "you" refer to the "sleeper" and are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Christ will shine on you** - Christ will enable an unbeliever to understand how evil his deeds are and how Christ will forgive him and give him new life, just as light shows what actually is there that darkness hid. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
