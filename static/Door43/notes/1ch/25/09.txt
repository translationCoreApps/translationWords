===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This begins the list of 24 lots that were cast to choose the order in which families would serve. This list ends in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:25:29|1 Chronicles 25:31]].

  * **the first ... fifth** - This shows the order in which the families were chosen. AT: "number 1 ... number 2 ... number 3 ... number 4 ... number 5" or use "the initial" for "the first" and "the next" for all of the following ones. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **the first lot fell to Joseph's family** - For all of the other people in the list, the text specifies that there were "twelve persons in number." Since this is implied, you may want to add this the statement about Joseph, as the UDB does. AT: "the first lot fell to Joseph's family, twelve persons in number" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Joseph ... Zaccur ... Nethaniah** - See how you translated these names in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:25:01|1 Chronicles 25:2]].
  * **Gedaliah** - See how you translated these names in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:25:01|1 Chronicles 25:3]].
  * **twelve persons** - "12 people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Izri** - This name is spelled Zeri in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:25:01|1 Chronicles 25:3]].
