\v 51 Laban also said to Jacob, "You see this large stone and this pile of rocks that we have set up to be between us.
\v 52 Both this pile of rocks and this large stone will remind us, that I will not go past these rocks to harm you, and you will not go past these rocks to harm me. We will ask the God whom Abraham and his father Nahor worshiped to punish \f + \ft metonymy \f* either one of us, if we harm the other one."

\v 53 So Jacob solemnly promised to do what they said in their peace agreement. And he asked God, the one before whom his father Isaac trembled, to listen to what they promised.

\v 51 Laban said to Jacob, "Look at this pile, and look at the pillar, which I have set between you and me.
\v 52 This pile is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass beyond this pile to you, and that you will not pass beyond this pile and this pillar to me, to do harm.
\v 53 May the God of Abraham, and the god of Nahor, the gods of their father, judge between us." Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This pile is a witness, and the pillar is a witness** - These piles of stones were to act as a remembrance and a boundary marker for Jacob and Laban regarding their peace agreement. They are spoken of as if they are human witnesses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **May the God of Abraham, and the god of Nahor, the gods of their father, judge between us** - Abraham is Jacob's grandfather. Nahor is Laban's grandfather. The father of Abraham and Nahor is Terah. Not all of them worshipped Yahweh.
  * **the Fear of his father Isaac** - Here the word "Fear" refers to Yahweh, who Isaac deeply respected and showed that respect by obeying him.
