====== Job 14 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. This chapter is a continuation of Job's claim of righteousness being presented to Yahweh. It also has an abrupt shift in tone. Rather than being hopeful, Job laments. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lament]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Resurrection ==
The events of Job occurred long before the Old Testament was written. Therefore, he likely had very little direct revelation about Yahweh. The resurrection of the dead was apparently not well-known during Job's day. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:reveal]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
Job uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter in his appeal to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
