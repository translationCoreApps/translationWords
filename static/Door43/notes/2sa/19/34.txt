\v 34 Barzillai replied to the king, "How many days are left in the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
\v 35 I am eighty years old. Can I distinguish between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be a burden to my master the king?
\v 36 Your servant would like to just go over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?
