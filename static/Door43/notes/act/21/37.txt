  * **Do you speak Greek? Are you not then the Egyptian, who previously led a rebellion and led the four thousand terrorists out into the wilderness?** - The chief captain uses these questions to express surprise that Paul is not who he thought he was. AT: "So you speak Greek. I thought you were that Egyptian who led a rebellion in the wilderness with the four thousand terrorists" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **Are you not then the Egyptian** - Shortly before Paul's visit, an unnamed man from Egypt had launched a revolt against Rome in Jerusalem. Later he escaped "into the desert," and the commander wonders if Paul might be the same man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **led a rebellion** - This word "rebellion" can be stated as a verb. AT: "caused people to rebel against the Roman government" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
