\v 31 Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother's name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
\v 32 He walked in the ways of Asa, his father; he did not turn away from them; he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh.
\v 33 However, the high places were not taken away. The people still had not directed their hearts to the God of their ancestors.
