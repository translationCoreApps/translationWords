====== 1 Corinthians 15:35-36 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 But some of you are asking, "How will dead people be raised \f + \ft Or:How will \add God\add* cause dead people to become alive \f* again? What kind of bodies will they have?"
\v 36 \add Anyone who asks such questions is\add* foolish. You \add know that\add* a seed that is planted in the ground must completely change its form \f + \ft metaphor \f* before it sprouts.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 Someone may ask you, "How can the dead rise? What kind of body could they ever have?"
\v 36 You know nothing! You do not think about the fact that any seed you plant in the ground will not start to grow until it dies.
</usfm>

\v 35 But someone will say, "How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body will they come?"
\v 36 You are so ignorant! What you sow will not start to grow unless it dies.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul gives some specifics about how the resurrection of the believers' bodies will take place. He gives a picture of natural and spiritual bodies and compares the first man Adam with the last Adam, Christ.

  * **But someone will say, "How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body will they come?"** - Possible meanings are 1) The person is asking sincerely or 2) the person is using the question to mock the idea of a resurrection. AT: "But some will say that they cannot imagine how God will raise the dead, and what kind of body God would give them in the resurrection." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **someone will say** - "someone will ask"
  * **with what kind of body will they come** - That is, will it be a physical body or a spiritual body? What shape will the body have? What will the body be made of? Translate using the most general question that someone who wants to know the answers to these questions would ask.
  * **You are so ignorant! What you sow** - Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so both instances of "you" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **You are so ignorant** - "You do not know about this at all"
  * **What you sow will not start to grow unless it dies** - A seed will not grow unless it is first buried underground. In the same way, a person has to die before God can resurrect him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
