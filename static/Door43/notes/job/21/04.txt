\q2 And it is certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* right for me to be impatient!
\q1
\v 5 Look at me! Does what you see not cause you to be appalled
\q2 and to put your hands over your mouths \add and say no more\add*?
\q1
\v 6 When I think about \add what has happened to me\add*,
\q2 I am frightened and my entire body shakes.

\q
\v 4 As for me, is my complaint to a person?
\q Why should I not be impatient?
\q
\v 5 Look at me and be astonished,
\q and lay your hand upon your mouth.
\q
\v 6 When I think about my sufferings, I am terrified,
\q and trembling seizes my body.
