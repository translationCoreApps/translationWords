===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the company of godless people** - "the group of godless people"
  * **fire will consume their tents of bribery** - The phrase "tents of bribery" means that the wicked people bought these tents with the money they made by bribery. AT: "the tents they bought with their bribes will be burned by fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_possession]])
  * **They conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity; their womb conceives deceit** - The same thought is repeated three times to emphasize how much evil these people produce. This speaks of a person planning to do evil things and doing them as if the person were conceiving and giving birth to these things as a woman conceives and gives birth to a child. AT: "They plan to cause mischief and do evil things; they are always planning to deceive others" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their womb conceives** - Here the "womb" is used to refer to the person to emphasize conception, as it is in the womb that conception takes place. AT: "they conceive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
