====== Jeremiah 13 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 13:15-27, which is an extended quotation.

== Symbolism ==

The action of hiding the undergarment was intended to be a symbolic event. It was supposed to get the Jews' attention and be a lesson for them to learn. Jeremiah performed the action, but it was not the action itself that was important. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
