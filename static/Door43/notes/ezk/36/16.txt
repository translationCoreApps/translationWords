\v 16 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 17 "Son of man, when the Israelite people were living in their own land, they defiled it by the things that they did. They made it unacceptable to me. I considered that their behavior was as disgusting as the rags that women use during their monthly menstrual periods.
\v 18 So I severely punished them, because they had murdered many people and because they had worshiped idols there. They made their entire land unacceptable to me.

\v 16 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 17 "Son of man, when the house of Israel inhabited their land, they defiled it with their ways and their deeds. Their ways were like the unclean menstruation of a woman before me.
\v 18 So I poured out my fury against them for the blood that they poured out on the land and for their pollution of it by their idols.
