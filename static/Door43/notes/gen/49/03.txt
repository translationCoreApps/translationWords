\v 3 Reuben, you are my oldest son.
You were born when I was young and energetic.
When I became a grown man, you were my first child. You are prouder and stronger than all the rest of my sons.
\v 4 But you were as unstable as ocean waves.
So now you will not be my most important son,
because you climbed up onto my bed and slept with my concubine. That caused me, your father, to have great shame.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength** - The phrases "my firstborn, my might" and "the beginning of my strength" mean the same thing. The words "might" and "strength" stand for Jacob's ability to produce children. The words "firstborn" and "beginning" mean that Reuben is his first child. AT: "my first child after I became a man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **outstanding in dignity, and outstanding in power** - This can be stated as a new sentence. AT: "You are first in honor and power" or "You surpass everyone else in honor and power"
  * **Uncontrollable as rushing water** - Jacob compares Reuben to water in a strong current to emphasize that he cannot control his anger and he is not stable. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **you will not have the preeminence** - "you shall not be first among your brothers"
  * **because you went up to your father's bed. Then you defiled it; you went up to my couch** - Here "bed" and "couch" stand for Jacob's concubine, Bilhah. Jacob is referring to when Reuben slept with Bilhah (See: [[:en:bible:notes:gen:35:21|35:22]]). AT: "because you went to my bed and slept with Bilhah my concubine. You have shamed me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **you went up to your father's bed ... you went up to my couch** - Both statements mean the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
