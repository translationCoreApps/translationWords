\v 3 As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—there will certainly no longer be any occasion for you to use this proverb in Israel.
\v 4 Behold! Every life belong to me—the life of the father as well as the life of the son belong to me! The soul who sins is the one who will die!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **As I live** - "As surely as I am alive." Yahweh uses this expression to show that what he says next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Behold!** - The word "Behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **The soul who sins** - Here the word "soul" represents the person. AT: "The person who sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
