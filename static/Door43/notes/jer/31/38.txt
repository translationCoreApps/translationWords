\v 38 "Look, the days are coming—this is Yahweh's declaration—when the city will be rebuilt for me, from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
\v 39 Then the measuring line will go out again farther, to the hill of Gareb and around Goah.
\v 40 The whole valley of the dead bodies and the ashes, and all the terraced fields going out to the Kidron Valley as far as the corner of the Horse Gate on the east, will be set apart for me, Yahweh. The city will not be pulled up or overthrown again, forever."
