\v 16  Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: 'Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and from his own fig tree, and drink from the water in his own cistern.
\v 17 You will do this until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.'
