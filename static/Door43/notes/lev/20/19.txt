===== translationNotes: =====

  * **sleeps with** - This is a polite way of saying that he had sex with his aunt. Some languages use more direct phrases such as "had sex with." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **You must carry your own guilt** - The idiom "carry your own guilt" means "you are responsible for your own sin." AT: "You are responsible for your sin" or "I will punish you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I will take away any inheritance their children might receive from their parents** - Many versions of the Bible translate this as "they will die childless."
