===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my words will not be false** - "what I say will not be false"
  * **someone who is mature in knowledge is with you** - The word "someone" refers to Elihu himself. He speaks of being very knowledgeable as if it were being mature in knowledge. AT: "I, who am with you, am very knowledgeable" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **See** - "Indeed." The word "See" here adds emphasis to what follows.
  * **he is mighty in strength of understanding** - The phrase "mighty in strength" forms a doublet that means "very strong." Elihu speaks of God understanding everything perfectly as if his understanding were very strong. AT: "he is very strong in understanding" or "he understands everything completely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
