====== Job 18 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. This chapter is  the advice of Job's friend, Bildad. His words in this chapter are much stronger than when he previously spoke, and he is even angry at Job. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Bildad's advice ==
Bildad tells Job to curse Yahweh. The advice Bildad gives to Job is bad advice. He tries to convince Job that he is sinning and has been punished by Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:curse]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])
