====== 1 Timothy 05:23-25 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 \add And Timothy\add*, no longer drink \add only\add* water, but instead, drink a little wine \add also\add*, because \add that may help to cure\add* your stomach's frequent illnesses.
\v 24 \add I tell you not\add* \add to set apart\f + \ft Or: appoint\add* \f* \add elders hastily, without seeing how they conduct their lives, because\add* some people \add sin secretly\add*, so that it is not known what they have done until after someone examines them \f + \ft Or: before God judges them \f*. But some people sin openly, so that people know what they have done before anyone examines them.
\v 25 Similarly, although \add some people\add* do good deeds openly, with the result that people know what they have done, some people \add do good deeds secretly\add*, yet the good deeds that they have done cannot remain secret either.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 No longer drink only water, Timothy. Instead, drink a little wine for your many stomach sicknesses.
\v 24 The sins of some people are clear to everyone, and the church does not need much time to judge them. But the church does not discover some sins until later.
\v 25 In the same way, some good deeds are clear to everybody, but even the other good deeds will become clear at some time in the future.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 You should no longer drink water. Instead, you should take a little wine for the stomach and your frequent sicknesses.
\v 24 The sins of some people are openly known, and they go before them into judgment. But some sins follow later.
\v 25 Likewise, some good works are openly known, but even the others cannot be hidden.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You should no longer drink water** - It is implied that Paul means Timothy should not drink only water. He is telling Timothy to use wine as medicine. The water in that area often caused sickness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **The sins of some people are openly known** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The sins of some people are very obvious" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they go before them into judgment** - "their sins go before those people into judgment." Paul speaks of sins as if they were moving. Possible meanings are 1) Their sins are so obvious that everyone will know they are guilty even before anyone testifies against them or 2) Their sins are evident, and God judges them now. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **But some sins follow later** - "But some sins follow those people later." Paul speaks of sins as if they were moving. Possible meanings are 1) Timothy and the Christian community will not know about certain sins until later or 2) God will not judge some sins until the final judgment. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **good** - Here "good" means they fit with God's character, purposes, and will.
  * **some good works are openly known** - "some good works are obvious"
  * **but even the others cannot be hidden** - Paul speaks of sins as if they were objects that someone could hide. This can be stated in active form. AT: "but people will later find out about even the good deeds that are not obvious" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
