Moses complained about having too much responsibility. Therefore, God gave seventy men the spirit of prophecy to help Moses. The people people complained about food, even though Yahweh was miraculously providing them with their food. The people complained because the did not have meat or fish to eat. God sent them quail. He punished some of the people, but it is not said why he did this. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]] and [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])
