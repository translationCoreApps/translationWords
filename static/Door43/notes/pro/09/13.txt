===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These verses begin to describe foolishness, which is also personified as a woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])

  * **The woman of foolishness** - It is possible to translate "foolishness" as a description. AT: "A foolish woman." However, if a language allows wisdom to be personified, as in the previous part of this chapter, it may also allow foolishness to be personified. AT: "The woman Foolishness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **she is untaught and knows nothing** - These two expressions basically mean the same thing, which is repeated to show how useless the foolish woman is. AT: "she does not know anything at all" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **she is untaught** - "she has not learned from experience" or "she is young and naive"
  * **walking straight on their way** - This seems to be an idiom for "thinking only of their own affairs" or "minding their own business." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
