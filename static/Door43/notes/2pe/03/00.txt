====== 2 Peter 03 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Fire ==
Fire is related to destruction and, because of this, it is associated with punishment.

== Day of the Lord ==
The exact time of the coming day of the Lord will come as a surprise to the world. This is what the simile "like a thief in the night" means. Because of this, Christians are to be prepared for the coming of the Lord. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:dayofthelord]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
