===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **no one can rescue anyone from my hand** - Here the word "hand" represents Yahweh's power. AT: "no one can rescue anyone from my power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **who can turn it back?** - Yahweh uses this question to say that no one can turn back his hand. It can be translated as a statement. Turning back his hand represents stopping him from doing something. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:14:26|14:27]].  AT: "no one can turn it back." or "no one can stop me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
