===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Israel.

  * **This city will not be your cooking pot, nor will you be the meat** - The people had spoken of themselves as if they were good cuts of meat and of the city as if it were a pot in which the meat was stored or cooked. Yahweh says that this in not true. See how you translated this metaphor in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:11:02|11:3]]. AT: "This city is not like a pot that will protect you as a pot protects meat." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **within the borders of Israel** - "in the land of Israel"
  * **the one whose statutes you have not walked in** - Yahweh speaks of obeying his statutes as if it were walking in them, like person would walk along a road. AT: "the one whose statutes you have not obeyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
