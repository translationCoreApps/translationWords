\v 1 Meanwhile, there were some priests in the temple courtyard. There was also the officer in charge of the temple guard, and some members of the Sadducee group. All these men came to Peter and John while the two of them were speaking to the people.
\v 2 These men were very angry because the two apostles were teaching the people about Jesus. What they were telling them was that God caused Jesus to become alive again after he had been killed.
\v 3 So these men arrested Peter and John and put them in jail. The Jewish council had to wait until the next day to question Peter and John, because it was already evening.
\v 4 However, many people who had heard Peter speak put their faith in Jesus. The number of men who believed in Jesus increased to about five thousand.

\v 1 As Peter and John were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them.
\v 2 They were deeply troubled because Peter and John were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead ones.
\v 3 They arrested them and put them in jail until the next morning, since it was now evening.
\v 4 But many of the people who had heard the message believed; and the number of the men who believed was about five thousand.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The religious leaders arrest Peter and John after Peter's having healed the man who was born lame.

  * **came upon them** - "approached them" or "came to them"
  * **They were deeply troubled** - "They were very angry." The Sadducees, in particular, would have been angry about what Peter and John were saying because they did not believe in resurrection. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead ones** - Peter and John were saying that God would raise people from the dead in the same way as he had raised Jesus from among the dead. Translate this in a way that allows "the resurrection" to refer to both Jesus' resurrection and the general resurrection of other people.
  * **from the dead ones** - "from among the dead people"
  * **They arrested them** - "The priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees arrested Peter and John"
  * **since it was now evening** - It was common practice not to question people at night.
  * **the number of the men who believed** - This refers only to men and does not include how many women or children believed.
  * **was about five thousand** - "grew to about five thousand"
