====== Job 13:6-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Listen to what I will say to you now;
\q2 listen while I am saying \add what is true about myself\add*.
\q1
\v 7 Are you telling lies to help God,
\q2 and saying what is deceitful in order to benefit him?
\q1
\v 8 Are you trying to defend him?
\q2 Are you trying to prove in a court that he is innocent?
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Listen to what I will say to you now;
\q2 listen while I am saying what is true about myself.
\q1
\v 7 You are telling lies to help God;
\q2 you are saying what is false in order to help him!
\q1
\v 8 You would really like to be kind to him by defending what he does, would you not?
\q2 It is as if you were trying to prove in a court that he is innocent!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 6 Hear now my own reasoning;
\q listen to the pleading of my own lips.
\q
\v 7 Will you speak unrighteously for God,
\q and will you talk deceitfully for him?
\q
\v 8 Would you really show kindness to him?
\q Would you really argue in court as attorneys for God?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Job continues to speak to his friends.

  * **listen to the pleading of my own lips** - Here "lips" represent the person who is speaking. AT: "listen to what I myself plead for" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Will you speak unrighteously ... deceitfully for him?** - Job uses these two questions to rebuke his friends for speaking unrighteously.  AT: "You think that you are speaking for God, but you are speaking unrighteously. You are speaking deceitfully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **talk deceitfully** - "lie" or "tell lies"
  * **Would you really ... as attorneys for God?** - Showing kindness to God represents helping God or defending God against Job's complaints. Job uses these questions to rebuke his friends for thinking that they can defend God.  AT: "You think that you can defend God. You think that you can argue for God like attorneys in court" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
