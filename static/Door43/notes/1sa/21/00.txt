====== 1 Samuel 21 General Notes ======
 
=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotes, songs, or poems. The ULB sets 21:11 apart through the use of indentation because it is a song. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== David and the high priest ==
David visits Ahimelech, who seems to have been the high priest. David lies to him about being on a special mission for the king. He asks for food, weapons, and prayer. The priest gives him some sacred bread and Goliath's sword. It becomes clear in 1 Samuel 22 that the priest also asks God's guidance for David. 

== David and the king of Gath ==
David flees to Gath. The advisers to the king tell him that David is almost the king of Israel. David becomes afraid of the king and pretends to be insane.


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical questions ==
The king of Gath's advisers use two rhetorical questions to warn him about how dangerous David could be: "Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another about him in dances, 'Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands?'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
