<usfm>
\v 1 My fellow believers, if you discover that a brother or sister is doing wrong, those of you whom God's Spirit is directing should gently correct that person. Furthermore, as you correct another person, you should be very careful so that you do not sin either.
\v 2 When there are brothers or sisters who have problems, you should help each other. By doing that, you will do what Christ commands.
</usfm>

\v 1 Brothers, if a man is caught in some sin, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Be concerned about yourself, so you also may not be tempted.
\v 2 Carry one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul teaches believers how they should treat other believers and how God rewards.

  * **Brothers** - Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:gal:01:01|1:2]].
  * **if a man** - "if someone" or "if anyone among you"
  * **is caught in some sin** - Possible meanings are 1) someone found that person in the act, "is discovered in an act of sin," or 2) that person committed the sin without intending to do evil, "gave in and sinned."
  * **you who are spiritual** - "those of you who are guided by the Spirit" or "you who are living in the guidance of the Spirit"
  * **restore him** - "correct the person who sinned" or "exhort the person who sinned to return to a correct relationship with God"
  * **in a spirit of gentleness** - Possible meanings are 1) that the Spirit is directing the one who is offering correction or 2) "with an attitude of gentleness" or "in a kind way."
  * **Be concerned about yourself** - These words treat the Galatians as though they are all one person to emphasize that he is talking to each of them. AT: "Be concerned about yourselves" or "I say to each one of you, 'Be concerned about yourself'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **so you also may not be tempted** - This can be stated in active form.  AT: "so that nothing will tempt you also to sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
