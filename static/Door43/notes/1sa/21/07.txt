===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Doeg ... herdsmen** - You may need to say clearly that Doeg saw what David did. AT: "Doeg ... herdsmen, and he saw what Ahimelech did." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Doeg** - man's name (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **detained before Yahweh** - Possible meanings are 1) "for Yahweh had detained him there," perhaps so Doeg could finish doing something he had promised Yahweh he would do (see UDB), or 2) no one knows why he was there, "for some reason" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **herdsmen** - the keepers and protectors of a herd, especially of cattle or sheep
