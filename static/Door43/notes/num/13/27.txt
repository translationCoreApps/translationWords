\v 27 They told Moses, "We reached the land to which you sent us. It certainly flows with milk and honey. Here is some produce from it.
\v 28 However, the people who make their homes there are strong. The cities are fortified and very large. We also saw descendants of Anak there.
\v 29 The Amalekites live in the Negev. The Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites have their homes in the hill country. The Canaanites live by the sea and along the Jordan River."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It certainly flows with milk and honey** - "Milk and honey certainly flow there." They spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the milk and honey from those animals and plants were flowing through the land. AT: "It is certainly excellent for raising livestock and growing crops" or "It is certainly very fertile land"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **milk** - Since milk comes from cows and goats, it represents livestock and the food produced from the the livestock. AT: "food from livestock" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **honey** - Since honey is produced from flowers, it represents crops and the food produced from the crops. AT: "food from crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
