====== Isaiah 47:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 You people \add of Babylon\add* who enjoy pleasure and sex,
\q2 listen to this:
\q1 You enjoy a luxurious life and you feel secure.
\q1 You say, 'We are \add like gods\add*,
\q2 and there are no others like us.
\q1 Our women will never become widows,
\q2 and our children will never be killed \add in wars\add*.'
\q1
\v 9 But both of those things will happen to you suddenly:
\q2 many of your women \bd will\bd* become widows
\q2 and many of your children \bd will\bd* die,
\q1 even though you perform much sorcery and many kinds of magic \add to prevent bad things from happening to you\add*.
\q1

\v 8 You people of Babylon who enjoy pleasure and sleeping with people without restraint,
\q2 listen to this:
\q1 You enjoy a luxurious life and you feel secure.
\q1 You say, 'We are like gods,
\q2 and there are no others like us.
\q1 Our women will never become widows,
\q2 and our children will never be killed in wars.'
\q1
\v 9 But both of those things will happen to you suddenly:

\q1
\v 8 So now hear this, you who loves pleasure and sits securely, 
\q1 you who say in your heart, "I exist, and there is no one else like me;
\q1 I will never sit as a widow, nor will I ever experience loss of children."

\q1
\v 9 But these two things will come to you in a moment in one day: 
\q1 the loss of children and widowhood; in full force they will come on you, 
\q1 despite your sorceries and your many incantations and amulets.
