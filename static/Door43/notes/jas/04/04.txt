\v 4 Like a woman who is unfaithful to her husband, you are being unfaithful to God and not obeying him anymore. Those who behave as evil people do belong to this world and are enemies against God. Perhaps you do not realize that.
\v 5 Surely you do not think that it is for no reason that God told us in the scriptures that the Spirit he placed in us yearns for us to live our lives in ways that please him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 You adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility against God? So whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
\v 5 Or do you think the scripture says in vain, "The Spirit he caused to live in us is deeply jealous"?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You adulteresses!** - James speaks of believers as being like a wife who sleeps with men other than her husband. AT: "You are not being faithful to God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do you not know ... God?** - James uses this question to teach his audience. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "You know ... God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **friendship with the world** - This phrase refers to identifying with or participating in the world's value system and behavior. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]).
  * **friendship with the world** - Here the world's value system is spoken of as if it were a person that others could be friends with. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **friendship with the world is hostility against God** - To be friends with the world means that one is an enemy of God. Here "friendship with the world" stands for people who are friends with the world, and "hostility against God" stands for people who are hostile against God. AT: "friends of the world are enemies of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Or do you think the scripture says in vain** - This is a rhetorical question James uses to exhort his audience. To speak in vain is to speak uselessly. AT: "There is a reason that scripture says"
  * **The Spirit he caused to live in us** - Some versions, including the ULB and UDB, understand this as a reference to the Holy Spirit. Other versions translate this as "the spirit" and mean by it the human spirit that each person has been created to have. We suggest that you use the meaning that is presented in other translations used by your readers.
