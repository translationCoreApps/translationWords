===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It will be as if I ate a meal of marrow and fatness** - Here the writer speaks of knowing and worshiping God as being more satisfying than eating a good meal. AT: "I will be happier than a person who eats a meal of fat and choice food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **with joyful lips my mouth will praise you** - Here "with joyful lips my mouth" represents the whole person who will praise God joyfully. AT: "I will praise you joyfully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **when I think about you on my bed ... in the night hours** - These two clauses have the same meaning. The ideas are repeated to emphasize how much the writer thinks about God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
