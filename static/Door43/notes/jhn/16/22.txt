====== John 16:22-24 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 It will be the same with you. Now \add I will die and\add* you will be sad. But after that, I will see you again. Then you will be joyful, and no one will be able to stop you from being joyful.
\v 23 When that happens, you will not ask me any questions \add about anything\add*. Listen to this carefully: \add After that happens, my\add* Father will do for you anything you ask, because of his relationship with me \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 24 Up to the present time you have not asked \add God to do\add* anything for you because of his relationship with me \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Now keep asking \add him for things that you need. If you do that\add*, you will receive them, and then you will be completely joyful.

\v 22 You, like her, have sorrow now, but I will see you again and God will give you great joy, joy no one can take from you.
\v 23 On that day, you will have no more questions to ask me. I am telling you the truth: whatever you ask the Father, he will it give it to you when you ask because you are joined to me.
\v 24 Up until now, you have not asked for anything like that. Ask and you will receive it, and God will give you such joy that fills everything.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 So you have sadness now, but I will see you again, and your heart will be glad, and no one will be able to take away your joy from you.
\v 23 On that day you will not ask me anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.
\v 24 Until now you have not asked anything in my name. Ask, and you will receive so that your joy will be fulfilled.
