===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul reminds the believers in Rome that God chose him to reach the Gentiles.

  * **I myself am also convinced about you, my brothers** - Paul is quite sure that the believers in Rome are honoring each other in their behavior. AT: "I myself am completely sure that you yourselves have acted toward others in a completely good way" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **brothers** - Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.
  * **filled with all knowledge** - Paul exaggerates here to emphasize his point. AT: "filled with sufficient knowledge to follow God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **also able to exhort one another** - Here "exhort" means to teach. AT: "also able to teach each other" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
