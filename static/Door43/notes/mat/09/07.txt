===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This concludes the account of Jesus healing a paralyzed man. Jesus then calls a tax collector to be one of his disciples.

  * **praise** - Use the same word you used in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:15|5:16]].
  * **who had given** - "because he had given"
  * **such authority** - This refers to the authority to declare sins forgiven.
  * **As Jesus passed by from there** - This phrase marks the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **passed by** - "was leaving" or "was going"
  * **Matthew ... him ... He** - Church tradition says that this Matthew is the author of this Gospel, but the text gives no reason to change the pronouns from "him" and "He" to "me" and "I."
  * **He said to him** - "Jesus said to Matthew"
  * **He got up and followed him** - "Matthew got up and followed Jesus." This means Matthew became Jesus' disciple.
