====== Isaiah 05:8-10 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Terrible things will happen to you who continually \add illegally\add* acquire houses and fields.
\q1 You force one family after another to leave their homes
\q2 until you are the only ones \f + \ft hyperbole \f* still living in the land.
\p
\v 9 But I heard the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels solemnly declare this:
\q1 "Some day, many of those huge houses will be empty\f + \ft Or: deserted \f*;
\q2 no one will be living in those beautiful mansions.
\q1
\v 10 The vines on ten acres of land will not produce enough grapes to make six gallons\f + \ft Or: 22 liters \f* of juice, Or: wine,
\q2 and ten baskets of seed will produce only one basket of grain."

\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Terrible things will happen to those who keep acquiring houses and fields \q1 without paying attention to the laws about who owns the land.
\q1 You use your riches to gain more and more property,
\q2 and soon there is no more property for others to buy,
\q2 and you would be the only land owners there are in that place.
\p
\v 9 But I heard Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, solemnly declare this:
\q1 "Some day, many houses will have no one to live in them, 
\q2 even the large and beautiful homes will be empty.
\q1
\v 10 The land that grows vines in this place should require ten pairs of oxen to work them, 
\q1 but this land would not produce enough grapes to make even twenty liters of wine.
\q2 When ten baskets of seed are sown on that land, 
\q1 that land will only produce one basket of grain at harvest time."

\q1
\v 8 Woe to those who join house to house, who join field to field,
\q1 until no room remains, and you alone remain in the land!
\q1
\v 9 Yahweh of hosts told me,
\q1 many houses will be empty, even great and impressive ones, without any inhabitant.
\q1
\v 10 For a ten-yoke vineyard will yield only one bath, and one homer of seed will yield only an ephah.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah announces God's judgment.

  * **to those who join house to house, who join field to field** - "to those who take more and more houses, and who take more and more fields." Isaiah assumes that his audience knows that the law forbids someone from taking land from a family permanently. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Yahweh of hosts** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].
  * **without any inhabitant** - "without anyone living in it"
  * **a ten-yoke vineyard** - The size of the vineyard is represented by the number of pairs of oxen that could plow it in one day. Each pair of oxen would be connected by a yoke. AT: "a vineyard that is large enough for ten pairs of oxen to plow it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **one bath** - "one bath of wine" or "22 liters of wine" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bvolume]])
  * **one homer of seed will yield only an ephah** - "220 liters of seed will produce only 22 liters of grain." One homer equals ten ephahs. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bvolume]])
