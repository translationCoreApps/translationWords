===== translationNotes: =====

  * **you have brought down his throne to the ground** - Here "throne" represents the power to rule as king. AT: "you, Yahweh, have ended his reign as king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **You have shortened the days of his youth** - This is a way of saying God made the king seem old even while he was still young. AT: "Even while he is young you have made him weak like an old man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **covered him with shame** - Yahweh completely humiliating the king is spoken of as if shame were a garment that God used to cover the king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
