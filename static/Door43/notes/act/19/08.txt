\v 8 For three months after that, Paul entered the Jewish meeting place in Ephesus on each Sabbath and taught and persuaded people about Jesus and how God would show himself as king.
\v 9 But some of the Jews would not believe the message and did not want to to hear it any more. They said many bad things about what Paul was teaching. So Paul left them and took the believers with him to meet in the meeting place of Tyrannus.
\v 10 For two years Paul taught people there. In this way, most of the Jews and non-Jews who lived in the region of Asia heard the message about the Lord Jesus.

\v 8 Paul went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God.
\v 9 But when some Jews were hardened and disobedient, they began to speak evil of the way of Christ before the crowd. So Paul left them and led the believers away from them. He reasoned with them every day in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
\v 10 This continued for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
