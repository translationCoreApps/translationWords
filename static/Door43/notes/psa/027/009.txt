===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do not hide your face from me** - The face here represents Yahweh's attention. The phrase "do not hide your face" is a way of asking God not to reject him. AT: "Do not reject me" or "Do not stop taking care of me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **do not turn your servant away in anger** - David said "your servant" to refer to himself in a humble way. AT: "do not be angry with me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **forsake me or abandon me** - The words "forsake" and "abandon" mean the same thing. The writer is emphasizing that he does not want God to leave him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **or abandon me** - The words "and do not" are understood. AT: "and do not abandon me" or "and do not leave me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **God of my salvation** - The abstract noun "salvation" can be stated as "saves." AT: God who saves me" or because you are the God who saves me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Even if my father and my mother forsake me** - "Even if my father and my mother were to forsake me." He is not saying that they actually have done this or that they would do it. His point is that even if they did that, God would not abandon him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **Yahweh will take me in** - "Yahweh will keep me" or "Yahweh will take care of me"
