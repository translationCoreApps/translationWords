  * **a snare** - a trap that catches animals with ropes

  * **Many are those who seek the face of the ruler** - The word "face" is a metonym for the ruler listening to people telling him what they want him to do and then doing it. AT: "Many people want their ruler to pay attention to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **from Yahweh is justice for a person** - It is Yahweh, not human rulers, who will see that people treat a person justly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
