===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak to Pharaoh and to speak of him as if he were a monster, perhaps a crocodile,  in the water.

  * **The Lord Yahweh says this** - Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:05|5:5]].
  * **So I will spread my net over you in the assembly of many peoples** - God's punishment of Pharaoh is spoken of as if the king were the river monster caught in a net. AT: "So I will gather many peoples and throw my net over you." ([[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will abandon you in the land** - "I will leave you helpless on the land." The monster that was fearsome and powerful when it was in the water cannot do anything when it is left on dry land. 
  * **all the birds of the heavens** - "all the birds that fly in the sky"
  * **the hunger of all living animals on earth will be satisfied by you** - This can be put into active form. AT: "I will let all the animals of the earth eat your body until they are hungry no longer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
