===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

  * **You made their children** - Yahweh made the descendants of the Israelites at the time of Moses
  * **gave them into their hands** - The Canaanites are spoken of as if they were small objects that a person could place in the hand of another person. To give something into a person's hand is to give that person complete control over that thing. AT: "enabled the Israelites to have complete control over them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
