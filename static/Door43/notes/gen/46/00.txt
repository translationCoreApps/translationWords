====== Genesis 46 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Going to Egypt ==
Yahweh allowed Israel to go to Egypt. He was to trust in Yahweh and his covenant faithfulness. God continued to bless them in Egypt. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:trust]], [[:en:obe:kt:covenantfaith]] and [[:en:obe:kt:bless]])

== Shepherds ==

Because of the regular flooding of the Nile River, the Egyptians economy revolved around farming more than the raising of animals. Therefore, the Egyptians despised the nomadic lifestyle of shepherds. Joseph's instructions permitted the Hebrew people to live separately from the Egyptians.
