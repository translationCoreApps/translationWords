<usfm>
\v 25 Jesus answered them, "I have told you, but you would not believe me. You know who I am because of the miracles and other things I do by my Father's name and his authority. Those things tell you all you need to know about me.
\v 26 You do not believe in me because you do not belong to me. You are sheep who belong to another shepherd.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins to respond to the Jews.


  * **in the name of my Father** - Here "name" is a metonym for the power of God.  Here "Father" is an important title for God. Jesus performed miracles through his Father's power and authority. AT: "through my Father's power" or "with my Father's power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]]) 
  * **these testify concerning me** - His miracles offer proof about him like a person who testifies would offer proof in a court of law. AT: "offer proof concerning me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **not my sheep** - The word "sheep" is a metaphor for the followers of Jesus. AT: "not my followers" or "not my disciples"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
