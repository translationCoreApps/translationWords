\v 20 Peter also said, "I see that what happened to Judas is like what the Psalms says: 'May his family line die out; may there be no one left in it at all.' And it seems that these other words that David wrote also refer to Judas: 'Let someone else take over his work as a leader.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter continues his speech to the believers that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:01:15|1:16]].
  * **General Information:** - Based on the situation with Judas that Peter just recounted, he recalls two Psalms of David that relate to the incident. The quote ends at the end of this verse.

  * **For it is written in the Book of Psalms** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "For David wrote in the Book of Psalms" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **Let his field be made desolate, and do not let even one person live there** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Let his field be made desolate** - Possible meanings are 1) that the word "field" refers to the field where Judas died or 2) that the word "field" refers to Judas's dwelling place and is a metaphor for his family line. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **be made desolate** - "become empty"
