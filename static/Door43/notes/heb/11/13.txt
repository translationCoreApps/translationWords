\v 13 It was while they still trusted in God that all those people died. Even though they had not yet received the things that God had promised to give them, \add it was as though\add* they saw those things in a distance. They were glad \add to know\add* about what he promised. It was as though they admitted that they were not from this earth, but that they were only here temporarily.
\v 14 As for those people who say\f + \ft Or: believe \f* such things, they clearly show that they long for \add a place that will become\add* their true native land.

\v 13 It was in faith that all these died without receiving the promises. Instead, after seeing and greeting them from far off, they admitted that they were foreigners and exiles on earth.
\v 14 For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **without receiving the promises** - This speaks of promises as if they are objects that a person receives. AT: "without receiving what God had promised them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **after seeing and greeting them from far off** - Future promised events are spoken of as if they were travelers arriving from far away. AT: "after learning what God will do in the future" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they admitted** - "they acknowledged" or "they accepted"
  * **they were foreigners and exiles on earth** - Here "foreigners" and "exiles" mean basically the same thing. This emphasizes that this earth was not their true home. They were waiting for their true home that God would make for them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **a homeland** - "a country for them to belong to"
