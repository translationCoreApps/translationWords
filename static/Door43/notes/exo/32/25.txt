\v 25 Moses saw that Aaron had allowed the people to get out of control and to do things that would make their enemies think the Israelite people were foolish.
\v 26 So he stood at the entrance to the camp and shouted, "Everyone who is loyal to Yahweh should come close to me!" So all the men in the tribe of Levi gathered around him.
\v 27 Then he said to them, "Yahweh, the God of the Israelite people, commands that every one of you should fasten your sword to your side, and then go through the camp from this gate to the other one. Each one of you must kill the other men, whether they are your brother, your friend, or your neighbor."

\v 25 Moses saw that the people were running wild (for Aaron had let them get out of control, causing their enemies to mock them).
\v 26 Then Moses stood at the entrance to the camp and said, "Whoever is on Yahweh's side, come to me." All the Levites gathered around him.
\v 27 He said to them, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, says this: 'Let each man fasten his sword on his side and go back and forth from entrance to entrance throughout the camp, and kill his brother, his companion, and his
neighbor.'"
