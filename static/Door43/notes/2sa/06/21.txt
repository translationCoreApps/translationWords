\v 21 David replied to Michal, "I was doing that to honor Yahweh, who chose me instead of your father and other members of his family, to be the king of the Israelite people, the people who belong to Yahweh. And I will continue to dance to honor Yahweh!
\v 22 Even though you think that what I did was disgraceful, I will continue to act in this way because I am willing to be made a fool in my own eyes. But the female servants whom you were talking about, they will give me honor!"
\p
\v 23 As a result, Saul's daughter never gave birth to any children.

\v 21 David responded to Michal, "I did that before Yahweh, who chose me above your father and above all his family, who appointed me leader over the people of Yahweh, over Israel. Before Yahweh I will be joyful!
\v 22 I will be even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes. But by these slave girls you have spoken about, I will be honored."
\v 23 So Michal, the daughter of Saul, had no children to the day of her death.

  * **who chose me above your father** - Here "your" refers to Michal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **over the people of Yahweh, over Israel** - Here "the people of Yahweh" and "Israel" mean the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **I will be even more undignified than this** - David is being ironic and means the opposite of what he said. He does not believe what he did was actually undignified or that his actions in the future will be undignified. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **I will be humiliated in my own eyes** - Here "in my own eyes" represents what a person considers or thinks about something. AT: "I will consider myself humiliated" or "I will consider myself a fool" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **But by these slave girls you have spoken about, I will be honored** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "But the slave girls of whom you have spoken will honor me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
