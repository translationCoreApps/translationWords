===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Honor for Yahweh leads people to life; anyone who has it will be satisfied** - This means that they will live a long time if they honor Yahweh. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. AT: "Those who honor Yahweh will live a long time; anyone who honors Yahweh will be satisfied" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **anyone who has it** - Here the word "it" refers to "honor for Yahweh."
  * **satisfied and not afflicted by harm** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "satisfied; nothing will harm him" or "satisfied; he will be safe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **sluggard** - Translate this word the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:10:26|10:26]].
  * **buries his hand in the dish** - "dips his hand in the dish" or "puts his hand in his plate." In the Biblical culture people usually ate with their hands as people do in many cultures today. 
  * **he will not even bring it back up to his mouth** - He does not bring his hand back to his mouth because he is too lazy. AT: "but he is too lazy to bring his hand up to his mouth to feed himself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
