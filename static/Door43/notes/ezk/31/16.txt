===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 I caused the people of other nations to tremble when they heard that tree fall to the ground. \add They realized\add* that it would decay, like all people who die and are buried decay. And all the \add people represented by\add* other beautiful trees in my garden in Eden and in Lebanon, who were like beautiful trees that were very proud, ones which had roots that grew down deep into the \add ground where there was plenty of\add*water, were comforted when \add the king represented by\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* that cedar tree was there with them in the place where the dead people are.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 I caused the people of other nations to tremble when they heard that tree fall to the groundâ€”when they heard that Assyria had been destroyed. All the other people groups had also been like beautiful, well-watered trees in Lebanon, but they were comforted when the king represented by that cedar tree arrived among them in the place where they were as dead people.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 I brought shuddering to the nations at the sound of its downfall, when I threw it down to Sheol with those who went down into the pit. So I comforted all the trees of Eden in the lowest parts of the earth. These had been the choicest and best trees of Lebanon; the trees that drank the waters.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.

  * **when I threw it down to Sheol with those who went down into the pit** - Here "threw it down to Sheol" is an idiom that means to kill. "The pit" refers to the grave; because the grave was thought to be the entrance to the world of the dead, the pit also represents that world. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:31:13|31:14]]. AT: "when I killed the cedar and it went to Sheol with everyone else that is dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]). 
  * **in the lowest parts of the earth** - "that were already deep down in the ground." This is an idiom. AT: "that had already died and are now in Sheol" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the choicest and best trees of Lebanon; the trees that drank the waters** - "the best trees of Lebanon that everyone would want; trees that got a lot of water." This is describing the trees of Eden that were in the lowest parts of the earth.
  * **the choicest** - This is something that everyone would want because it is very good.
