===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

  * **Whom are you worried about? Whom do you fear so much ... about me?** - Yahweh uses these questions to scold the people. AT: "You must really fear these idols for you to act so deceitfully ... about me!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **so much that you would not remember me or think about me** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that, although the people should have remembered Yahweh, they did not. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **I will proclaim all your righteous acts and tell all that you have done** - Yahweh is being sarcastic, calling their evil deeds so-called righteousness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
