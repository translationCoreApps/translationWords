===== translationNotes: =====

  * **dogs have surrounded me** - The writer speaks about his enemies as if they were dogs. His enemies are coming close to him like wild dogs do to a dying animal. AT: "my enemies are like dogs that have surrounded me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a company of evildoers** - "a group of evildoers" or "a gang of evildoers"
  * **encircled** - "surrounded"
  * **they have pierced my hands and my feet** - This continues the dog metaphor. The writer speaks about his enemies as if they were dogs that are biting and piercing his hands and feet with their teeth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **pierced** - stabbed through something with a sharp object
  * **I can count all my bones** - Possible meanings are 1) the writer is so thin that he can see his bones. AT: "I can see all of my bones" or "I can feel each of my bones" or 2) this continues the dog metaphor and the writer can see his bones after the dogs have ripped his flesh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **look and stare at me** - The words "look" and "stare" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that people look at him awkwardly and make fun of him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
