===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Moses, Aaron, and the whole community of the people of Israel ... The people of Israel did this with them** - Here there are three parallel sentences that give the same information. It is repeated to emphasize that the people did to the Levites as Yahweh had commanded. AT: "Moses, Aaron, and the whole community of the people of Israel did with the Levites everything that Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
