  * **song of ascents** - Possible meanings are 1) "song people sang while going up to Jerusalem for a celebration" or 2) "song people sang while going up the steps into the temple" or 3) "song whose words are like steps." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:120:001|120:1]]

  * **you will be blessed and prosper** - The words "be blessed" and "prosper" share similar meanings and emphasize God's favor. AT: "Yahweh will bless you and prosper you" or "Yahweh will make you blessed and prosperous" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
