===== translationNotes: =====

  * **it was written** - This can be stated in an active form. AT: "someone had written" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **your house** - This term refers to the temple, God's house.
  * **consume** - The word "consume" points to the metaphor of "fire." Jesus' love for the temple is like a fire that burns within him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **sign** - This refers to an event that proves something is true.
  * **these things** - This refers to Jesus' actions against the money changers in the temple.
  * **Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up** - Jesus is referring to his own body as the temple that will die and come back to life three days later. Translate this in a way that describes tearing down and rebuilding a building. Jesus is not commanding his disciples to tear down the actual temple building. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **raise it up** - This means to "rebuild" or "restore."
