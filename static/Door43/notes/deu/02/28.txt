\v 28 You will sell me food for money, so that I may eat; give me water for money, so that I may drink; only let me pass through on my feet;

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues Moses' message to King Sihon.

  * **You will sell me food for money, so that I may eat; give me water for money, so that I may drink** - Moses tells Sihon that the Israelites will not steal from the Amorites and requests that Sihon and his people sell food and water to the Israelites; he is not giving a command. AT: "I expect to have to pay for food so I can eat and to pay for water so I can drink"
  * **sell me ... I may eat ... give me ... I may drink** - Moses is referring to the people of Israel as if they were Moses himself. AT: "sell to me and my people ... we may eat ... give us ... we may drink" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **only let me pass through on my feet** - "only let us walk through your land"
  * **Ar** - This is the name of a place. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:02:09|2:9]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
