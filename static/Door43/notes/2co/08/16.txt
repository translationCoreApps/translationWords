\v 16 We thank God because he has caused Titus to care for you as much as I do.
\v 17 When we asked him to help you, he agreed to do so. He was so eager to help you that he decided to visit you himself.

\v 16 But thanks be to God, who put into Titus' heart the same earnest care that I have for you.
\v 17 For he not only accepted our appeal, but he was also very earnest about it. He came to you of his own free will.
