====== Philippians 03:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I was \add so\add* zealous \add to make people obey those laws that\add* I caused the people who believe in Christ to suffer \add because I thought they were trying to abolish those laws. Indeed\add*, as far as my obeying those laws is concerned, no \add one could\add* have accused \add me by\add* saying that I had disobeyed any of those laws.


\p
\v 7 Nevertheless, all such things as those, which I used to \add consider to\add* be useful to me, those \add very\add* things I now consider worthless, because I \add want to know\add* Christ \f + \ft Or: in order that I \add may know\add* Christ \f*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I was so passionate to make people obey the law that I caused believers in Christ to suffer. No one could say that I ever disobeyed the law.
\p
\v 7 But everything that I then considered to be important I now consider to be worthless, because Christ has changed me.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I zealously persecuted the church. In respect to the righteousness of the law, I was blameless. 
\v 7 But whatever things were a profit for me, I have considered them as loss because of Christ.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I zealously persecuted the church** - Paul says here that he had been very eager to punish people for following Christ. "I was very determined to hurt Christian believers"
  * **In respect to the righteousness of the law, I was blameless** - "I obeyed the law completely"
  * **whatever things were a profit for me** - Paul is referring here to the praise he received for being an eager Pharisee. He speaks of this praise as if he had viewed it in the past as a businessman's profit. AT: "anything that other Jews praised me for" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I have considered them as loss** - Paul speaks of that praise as if he were now viewing it as a business loss instead of a profit. In other words, Paul says that all his religious acts of righteousness are worthless before Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
