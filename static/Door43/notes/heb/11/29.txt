\v 29 It was because they trusted God that when the \add Israelite\add* people walked through where the Red Sea had been, it was as though they walked on dry land! But, when the \add army of\add* Egypt also attempted to \add cross that same water\add*, they drowned, because \add the sea came back and flooded them!\add*
\p
\v 30 It was because the \add Israelite\add* people trusted God that the walls around Jericho \add city\add* collapsed, after the Israelites marched around the walls for seven days.
\p
\v 31 Rahab \add had been\add* a prostitute, but because she trusted God, she did not perish with those \add inside Jericho\add* who disobeyed \add God. Joshua sent some spies\add* into the city \add in order\add* to find ways to destroy it, but God saved her because she welcomed those spies \add peaceably\add*.

\v 29 It was by faith that they passed through the Sea of Reeds as if over dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do this, they were swallowed up.
\v 30 It was by faith that Jericho's walls fell down, after they had been circled around for seven days.
\v 31 It was by faith that Rahab the prostitute did not die with those who were disobedient, because she had received the spies in peace.
