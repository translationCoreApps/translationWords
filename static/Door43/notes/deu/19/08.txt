\v 8 If Yahweh your God enlarges your borders, as he has sworn to your ancestors to do, and gives you all the land that he promised to give to your ancestors;
\v 9 if you keep all these commandments to do them, which I am commanding you todayâ€”commandments to love Yahweh your God and to always walk in his ways, then you must add three more cities for yourself, besides these three.
\v 10 Do this so that innocent blood is not shed in the midst of the land that Yahweh your God is giving you for as an inheritance, so that no bloodguilt may be on you.
