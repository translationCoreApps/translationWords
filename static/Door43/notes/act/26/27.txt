===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do you believe the prophets, King Agrippa?** - Paul asks this question to remind Agrippa that Agrippa already believes what the prophets said about Jesus. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "You already believe what the Jewish prophets said, King Agrippa." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **In a short time would you persuade me and make me a Christian?** - Agrippa asks this question to show Paul that he cannot convince Agrippa so easily without more proof. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "Surely you do not think you can convince me so easily to believe in Jesus!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **but without these prison chains** - Here "prison chains" stands for being a prisoner. AT: "but, of course, I do no want you to be a prisoner like I am" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
