\v 31 The people of Israel called that food "manna." It was white like coriander seed, and its taste was like wafers made with honey.
\v 32 Moses said, "This is what Yahweh has commanded: 'Let an omer of manna be kept throughout your people's generations so that your descendants might see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, after I brought you out from the land of Egypt.'"
