===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Can you understand God by searching for him? Can you comprehend the Almighty perfectly?** - These two parallel questions are asking the same thing. The writer uses the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "You cannot understand God by searching for him, and you will never completely understand the Almighty!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **The matter** - This refers to understanding God. AT: "To understand God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **is as high as heaven ... deeper than Sheol** - The impossibility of understanding God is spoken of as if it were impossible to go to these extremely far away places. AT: "is as inaccessible as the highest places in heaven ... is more inaccessible than the deepest places in Sheol" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **what can you do?** - Zophar uses this question to show that a person cannot do anything to understand God fully. AT: "you cannot do anything." or "you cannot understand him fully." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **what can you know?** - Zophar uses this question to show that a person cannot do anything to know God fully. AT: "you cannot know God fully." or "you cannot know all there is to know." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **Its measure** - Possible meanings are that this refers to 1) God's greatness or 2) the greatness of God's wisdom.
  * **is longer than the earth ... wider than the sea** - God's greatness or wisdom is spoken of as if it could be measured in distance. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
