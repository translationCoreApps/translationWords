====== Jeremiah 09 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 9:1-12, 17-24, which are extended quotations.

The prophecy revealed to Jeremiah is recorded in 8:5-9:12. Despite covering more than one chapter, this should be seen as one unit. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:reveal]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Funeral ==
This chapter pictures Jerusalem as having a funeral with its typical songs. This is an image used to describe the describe their destruction. It is a time of great sadness. 

== Circumcision ==
Circumcision is used here in an unusual way. Since circumcision was intended to be a display of faith, the author uses the term to differentiates between those who have faith in Yahweh and those who don't. This is a type of metaphor. Those who have a circumcised heart have faith in Yahweh while those with an uncircumcised heart do not have faith in Yahweh, regardless of whether they are physically circumcised. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:circumcise]], [[:en:obe:kt:faith]], [[:en:obe:kt:uncircumcised]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
