===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Ezekiel continues to tell about the vision that he saw.

  * **He said to me** - If your language has to identify the one speaking, it would be best to identify the speaker as the "one who looked like a man" ([[:en:bible:notes:ezk:01:26|1:26]]). It was not "the Spirit."
  * **the Spirit** - Other possible meanings are 1) "a spirit" or 2) "a wind."
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **to the people of Israel, to rebellious nations** - "to the Israelites, to rebellious peoples." The two phrases refer to the same people. AT: "to the people of Israel, who are rebellious"
  * **up to this very day** - "even now" or "even today." This means that the people of Israel were continuing to disobey God.
