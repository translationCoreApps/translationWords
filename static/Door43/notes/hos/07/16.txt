<usfm>
\v 16 They go this way and that, but never to me, God Most High.
\q2 They are like a bow that cannot shoot.
\q1 Their officers will be killed by their enemies' swords;
they will die because they have insulted me.
\q1 This is why the people in Egypt will insult them."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 16 They return,
\q but they do not return to me, the Most High.
\q They are like a slack bow.
\q Their officials will fall by the sword
\q because of the insolence of their tongues.
\q This will become their mockery in the land of Egypt.
