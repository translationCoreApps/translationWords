===== translationNotes: =====

  * **your brothers will praise you ... Your father's sons will bow down before you** - These two statements mean the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **will praise you. Your hand** - The second sentence states the reason for the first sentence. The word "for" or "because" can be added to make this clear. AT: "will praise you. For your hand" or "will praise you because your hand" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_connectingwords]])
  * **Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies** - This is a way of saying "You will conquer your enemies." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **bow down** - This means to bend over to humbly express respect and honor toward someone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
