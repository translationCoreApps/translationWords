====== 2 Corinthians 09:3-5 ======

\v 3 However, I am sending Titus and the other two believers in order that \add they will be able to help you finish collecting the money. Then when I and others arrive later, the people with me will see for themselves that\add* the things that I have been boasting about you are true \f + \ft litotes \f*. \add I want\add* you \add to have your gift\add* ready \add for us\f + \ft exclusive \f* to take to Jerusalem\add*, just like I have been telling them that you were ready.
\v 4 When I come, if any of \add the believers from\add* Macedonia come with me, \add I do not want them to find that your gift is\add* \f + \ft metonymy, euphemism \f* not ready. If that were \add to happen\add*, I would be very ashamed, and you yourselves would be even more ashamed.
\v 5 So that is why I felt that it was necessary to urge these \add three\add* believers to go \add and visit\add* you before I \add come. In that way, they would be able to help you to finish\add* collecting the generous gift \f + \ft euphemism \f* that had been promised by you \f + \ft Or:you had said you would give \f*. \add If you do that, not only will\add* the gift be ready \add by the time that we arrive, but everyone will see that you have given because you really want to give, and\add* not because anyone has forced you to give.

\v 3 For I am sending the brothers ahead of me, so that when they meet you, they will see that we did not praise you for nothing; I also sent them ahead of me so that you would be ready to finish the work, as I promised others you would be.
\v 4 I am afraid that some Macedonians might come with me when I come a little later, and that they might find that you are not ready to give all that you want to give. If that happens, we will be ashamed that we spoke so well about you—and you would be ashamed, too.
\v 5 I decided it was necessary to make every effort to send the brothers to you, so they could set in order everything necessary to receive the money you have promised to give. In this way, this money will be something you freely offer, rather than a tax that we make you pay.

\v 3 Now I have sent the brothers so that our boasting about you may not be futile, and so that you would be ready, as I said you would be.
\v 4 Otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we would be ashamed—I say nothing about you—for being so confident in you.
\v 5 So I thought it was necessary to urge the brothers to come to you and to make arrangements in advance for the gift you have promised. This is so that it might be ready as a blessing, and not as something extorted.
