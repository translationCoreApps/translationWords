\v 40 When he returned, he found that they were sleeping again; they were so sleepy that they could not keep their eyes open. Because they were ashamed, they did not know what to say to him when he awakened them.
\v 41 Then he went and prayed again. He returned a third time and found them sleeping again. He said to them, "You are still asleep? No more of this! The time for me to suffer is about to begin. Look! Someone is about to enable sinful men to capture me, the Son of Man.
\v 42 So get up! Let us go! Look! Here comes the one who is enabling them to capture me!"

\v 40 Again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy and they did not know what to say to him.
\v 41 He came the third time and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough! The hour has come. Look! The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\v 42 Get up; let us go. Look, the one who is betraying me is near."
