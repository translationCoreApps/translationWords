\v 18 But it does not matter!\f + \ft Or: what does it matter? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* It does not matter whether \add people proclaim the message about Christ\add* because they have wrong motives, or whether \add people proclaim the message about Christ\add* because they have right motives. The important thing in either case is that \add the message about\add* Christ is being proclaimed \f + \ft Or:people are proclaiming \add the message about\add* Christ \f*. And because of that I rejoice!


\p Furthermore, I will continue to rejoice,
\v 19 because I know that the outcome of these \add troubles that I am experiencing\add* will \add be that some day God will\add* say that he approves \add of what I have done\add* \f + \ft Or: that \add the Roman authorities\add* will set me free \f*. \add This will happen\add* as a result of your praying for me, and \add as a result\add* of \add God's\add* Spirit, whom Jesus Christ gave me, helping me.

\v 18 But it does not matter! People are proclaiming the good news about Christ, either for good reasons or for bad reasons. So I am rejoicing that people are spreading the message about Jesus Christ! And I will continue to rejoice in that!
\p
\v 19 I will rejoice because I know that God will free me from prison. He will do this because you are praying for me and because the Spirit of Jesus Christ is helping me.

\v 18 So what? Either way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice! Yes, I will rejoice.
\v 19 For I know that this will result for me in deliverance. This will happen because of your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **So what** - Paul is stating that it is not important why some people are teaching about Jesus. AT: "I do not care" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Either way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed** - "As long as people preach about Christ, it does not matter if they do it for good reasons or for bad reasons"
  * **in this I rejoice** - "I am happy because people are preaching about Jesus"
  * **I will rejoice** - "I will celebrate" or "I will be glad"
  * **this will result for me in deliverance** - "because people proclaim Christ, God will deliver me"
  * **in deliverance** - The exact meaning of "deliverance," what God will deliver Paul from, is not clear. It would be best to use a general word for one person helping another person out of a bad situation (though see UDB).
  * **because of your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ** - "because you are praying and the Spirit of Jesus Christ is helping me"
  * **Spirit of Jesus Christ** - "Holy Spirit"
