===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Be sure that your sin will find you out** - Moses speaks of sin as if it were a person who will condemn the guilty person. This means that the people cannot escape the punishment that their sin deserves. AT: "Know for sure that Yahweh will punish you for your sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Your servants** - The people of Gad and Reuben refer to themselves as "your servants." This is a polite way of speaking to someone with greater authority.
