===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul talks about going Jerusalem but does not leave Ephesus yet.

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Luke starts to tell a new part of the story.

  * **he decided in the Spirit** - Possible meanings are 1) Paul decided with the help of the Holy Spirit or 2) Paul decided within his own spirit, which means he made up his mind.
  * **Achaia** - Achaia was the Roman province in which Corinth was located. It was the largest city in southern Greece and the capital of the province. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:act:18:12|18:12]].
  * **I must also see Rome** - "I must also travel to Rome"
  * **Erastus** - This is the name of a man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
