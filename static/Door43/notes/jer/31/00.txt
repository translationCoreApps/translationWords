====== Jeremiah 31 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 31:1-6, 8-22, 29, 35-37, which are extended quotations.

This chapter begins with a transition from the previous chapter. "At that time" is a reference to the day of restoration mentioned in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:30:23|30:24]]. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:restore]])
=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The New Covenant ==

This chapter is an important teaching regarding the New Covenant. God will make a new covenant that will bring forgiveness of sins and a desire to obey God. Scholars disagree about whether this new covenant has begun. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:newcovenant]], [[:en:obe:kt:forgive]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Israel ==
In this chapter, Jeremiah uses the term "Israel" in reference to the nation of Israel as a whole. He also uses it in reference to the northern kingdom of Israel and their people group.
