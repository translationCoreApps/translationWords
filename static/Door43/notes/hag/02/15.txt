====== Haggai 02:15-17 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Think about what has been happening to you before you began to lay the foundation of my temple.
\v 16 When you expected \add to harvest\add* twenty bushels of grain, \add you harvested\add* only ten bushels. When someone went to a big wine vat to get fifty gallons of wine, there were only twenty gallons in the vat.
\v 17 I sent blight\f + \ft Or: hot winds \f* and mildew and hail to destroy all your crops. But still you did not return to me.

\v 15 Think about what has been happening to you before you began to lay the foundation of my temple.
\v 16 When you expected to harvest twenty measures of grain, you harvested only ten. When someone went to a big wine vat to get fifty measures of wine, there were only twenty in the vat.
\v 17 I sent blight and mildew to destroy all your crops. But still you did not return to me.' This is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says to you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 So now, think in your minds about the past leading up to this very day. Before a stone was laid in the temple of Yahweh,
\v 16 how was it then? When one came to a heap of grain expecting twenty measures, but there were only ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty measures, but there were only twenty?
\v 17 I afflicted you and all the work of your hands with blight and mildew, but you still did not turn to meâ€”this is Yahweh's declaration.
