\v 32 The angel asked him, "Why did you strike your donkey three times \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? I have come to block your path because what you are planning to do is wrong.
\v 33 Three times your donkey saw me and turned away from me. If it had not done that, I would certainly have killed you already, but I would have allowed the donkey to live."

\v 31 Then Yahweh opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his drawn sword in his hand. Balaam lowered his head and lay facedown.
\v 32 The angel of Yahweh said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Look, I have come as someone hostile to you because your actions before me have been wicked.
\v 33 The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away from me, I would certainly have killed you and spared her life."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then Yahweh opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of Yahweh** - To "open one's eyes" is associated with being able to see. AT: "Then Yahweh gave Balaam the ability to see the angel of Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **with his drawn sword** - A sword is drawn from its sheath in order to be ready to use. AT: "with his sword ready to attack." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:num:22:21|22:23]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Balaam lowered his head and lay facedown** - This indicates that Balaam is humbling himself before the angel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **Why have you struck your donkey these three times?** - This rhetorical question is used to accuse Balaam of doing wrong. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "You should not have struck your donkey these three times." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **as someone hostile to you** - "as an enemy to you" or "to oppose you"
  * **If she had not turned ... killed you and spared her life** - This hypothetical statement indicated what could have happened, but it did not because the donkey's actions saved Balaam. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
