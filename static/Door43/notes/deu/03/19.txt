===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh.

  * **Yahweh gives rest to your brothers** - The writer speaks as if the ability to rest were a physical object that could be given as a gift. The word "rest" is also a metaphor for peaceful life in which there is no war. AT: "Yahweh allows your brothers to rest" or "Yahweh allows your brothers to stop fighting wars and live peacefully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **beyond the Jordan** - This refers to the land across the Jordan River, to the east of Israel. Moses was east of the Jordan when he said this. AT: "east of the Jordan River." Translate this as it is in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:01:01|1:1]].
  * **then will you return** - Moses is emphasizing that the other tribes must possess their land before Yahweh will permit these three tribes to possess their land. "only then are you to return."
