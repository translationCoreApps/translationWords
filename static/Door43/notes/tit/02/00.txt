====== Titus 02 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Gender roles ==

Scholars are divided over how to understand this passage in light of its historical and cultural context. Some scholars believe men and women are perfectly equal in all things (known as egalitarianism). Other scholars believe men and women were created to be distinct and to serve in different roles in marriage and the church (known as complementarianism). How one understands this issue may affect how this passage is translated.

== Slavery ==

This passage does not condone slavery as an acceptable practice. Paul's teaching on slavery would have been rather radical during his time because masters were not expected to treat their slaves in such a pleasant way. Overall, Paul's focus is on living in a way pleasing to God despite the circumstances of one's life. The translator should remember that Paul is in prison when he writes these words.
