===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues reminding the people of Israel of what happened in the past.

  * **Bashan ... Og ... Edrei ... Sihon ... Amorites ... Heshbon** - "the land of Bashan ... King Og ... the town of Edrei ... King Sihon ... the Amorite people group ... the town of Heshbon." See how you translated these in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:01:03|1:4]].
  * **Yahweh said to me, 'Do not fear him; ... given you ... under your control ... You will do ... you did ... at Heshbon.'** - Yahweh is speaking to Moses as if Moses were the Israelites, so all instances of "you" and "your" and the command "do not fear" are all plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **fear him ... over him ... his people and his land** - The words "him" and "his" refer to Og.
  * **I have given you victory** - Yahweh speaks of what he will do as if he had already done it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])
  * **You will do to him** - "You will destroy him." The word "him" is a metonym for "his people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
