\v 15 God allowed the second beast to breathe life into that idol in order that the idol might speak. And the beast commanded that whoever refused to worship the idol should be killed.
\v 16 The second beast also required that people should write the first beast's name on the right hand or on the forehead of everyone, whether these were important people or unimportant people, rich or poor, free or slave. Everyone!
\v 17 The second beast required this so that people could not buy anything or sell anything if they did not have the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number representing its name.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 It was permitted to give breath to the beast's image so that the image would even speak and cause all who refused to worship the beast to be killed.
\v 16 It also forced everyone, unimportant and mighty, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on the right hand or on the forehead.
\v 17 It was impossible for anyone to buy or sell unless he had the mark of the beast, that is, the number representing its name.
