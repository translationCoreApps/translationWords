===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For now I would have been lying down quietly; I would have slept and been at rest** - Job uses two phrases to think about what it would be like if he had never been born or had died at birth. (See: [[ en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **I would have been lying down quietly** - Job imagines something that could have happened in the past but which did not happen, as noted above. AT: "I should have been lying down quietly." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]]) 
  * **lying down quietly** - AT: "asleep, resting peacefully" (UDB)
  * **and been at rest** - Here the word "rest" means to sleep peacefully, but also that Job would not be experiencing the pain that he does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **with kings and counselors of the earth** - AT: "with kings and their advisers."
