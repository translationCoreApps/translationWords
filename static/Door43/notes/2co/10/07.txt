====== 2 Corinthians 10:7-8 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 \add I want you to understand what is\add* happening among you. There are certain \add people there who are telling you that\add* they know for sure that they are Christ's \add representatives and that I am not\add*. Those people should realize that I \add represent\add* Christ as much as they do.
\v 8 \add I say that\add* because the authority that the Lord gave me \add as his apostle\add* is to help you to become mature believers, not to cause you to stop \add trusting in Christ\add*. So even if I were to boast a little more than I have \add already done\add* \f + \ft Or: proudly talk a little more than I have \add already talked\add* about the authority the Lord gave me \add as his apostle\add* \f*, \add no one would be able to make me\add* ashamed \add by proving that Jesus has not given me that authority\add*.

\v 7 You should look at the clear facts. If anyone has faith that he belongs to Christ, remind him that just as he belongs to Christ, so do we!
\v 8 When I praised myself about our authority as apostles, that may have been too much for you. But the Lord gave that authority to me not to destroy you, but to help you and make you strong. So I am not ashamed of the authority the Lord gave me.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Look at what is clearly in front of you. If anyone is convinced that he is Christ's, let him remind himself that just as he is Christ's, so also are we.
\v 8 For even if I boast a little too much about our authority, which the Lord gave for us to build you up and not to destroy you, I will not be ashamed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Look at what is clearly in front of you** - Possible meanings are 1) this is a command or 2) this is a statement, "You are looking only at what you can see with your eyes." Some think this is a rhetorical question which may also be written as a statement. AT: "Are you looking at what is clearly in front of you?" or "You seem unable to see what is clearly in front of you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **let him remind himself** - "he needs to remember"
  * **that just as he is Christ's, so also are we** - "that we belong to Christ just as much as he does"
  * **to build you up and not to destroy you** - Paul speaks of helping the Corinthians to know Christ better as if he were constructing a building. AT: "to help you become better followers of Christ and not to discourage you so you stop following him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
