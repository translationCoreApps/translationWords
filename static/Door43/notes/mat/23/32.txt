===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You also fill up the measure of your fathers** - Jesus uses this as a metaphor meaning the Pharisees will complete the wicked behavior that their forefathers started when they killed the prophets. AT: "You also finish the sins your ancestors began" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You serpents, you offspring of vipers** - Serpents and vipers are the same thing. They are dangerous and often symbols of evil. AT: "You are as evil as dangerous and poisonous snakes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **offspring of vipers** - Here "offspring" means "having the characteristic of." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:03:07|3:7]].
  * **how will you escape the judgment of hell?** - Jesus uses this question as a rebuke. AT: "there is no way for you to escape the judgment of hell!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
