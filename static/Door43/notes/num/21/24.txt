\v 24 But the Israelites completely defeated them and occupied their land, from the Arnon \add River in the south\add* to the Jabbok \add River in the north\add*. They stopped at the border of the land where the Ammon people-group lived, because \add the Ammon army was defending\add* the border strongly.
\v 25 So the Israelites occupied all the cities and towns where the Amor people-group lived, and some of the Israelites began to live in them. They occupied Heshbon \add city\add* and the nearby villages.
