===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

  * **Have you ever ... be shaken out of it?** - This question expects a negative answer. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "You have never ... be shaken out of it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **since your own days began** - "since you were born" or "on any of the days that you have lived" 
  * **given orders to the morning to begin, and caused the morning dawn to know its place in the scheme of things** - These two phrases are similar in meaning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **given orders to the morning to begin, and caused the morning dawn to know** - Yahweh describes the morning as being able to receive orders and know things like a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) 
  * **caused the morning dawn to know its place in the scheme of things** - "caused the dawn to know where it belongs"
  * **dawn** - the daylight that appears in the morning sky before the sun rises
  * **so that it** - The word "it" refers to the dawn.
  * **take hold of the sides of the earth** - The light of dawn is spoken of as if it seizes the horizons of the earth. AT: "grasp the ends of the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **so that wicked people might be shaken out of it** - The daylight is pictured as causing wicked people to leave like shaking something to remove unwanted things. This can be stated in active form. AT: "and shake wicked people out of the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
