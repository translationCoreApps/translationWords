\v 22 Do \add what God commands in\add* his message. Do not only listen \add to it, because people who only listen to it and do not obey it\add* think wrongly \add that God will save them\add*.
\v 23 Some people hear God's message but do not do \add what it says\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. They are like someone who looks at his face in a mirror \f + \ft simile \f*.
\v 24 Although he looks at himself, he goes away \add from the mirror\add* and immediately forgets what he looks like.
\v 25 But other people look closely at \add God's\add* message, which is perfect and which sets people free \add to voluntarily do what God wants them to do\add*. And if they continue \add to examine God's message\add* and do not just hear it and then forget it, but do \add what God tells them to do\add*, God will bless them because of what they do.

<usfm>
\v 22 Be doers of the word and not only hearers, deceiving yourselves.
\v 23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word but not a doer, he is like a man who examines his natural face in a mirror.

\v 24 He examines himself and then goes away and immediately forgets what he was like.
\v 25 But the person who looks carefully into the perfect law of freedom, and continues to do so, not just being a hearer who forgets, this man will be blessed in his actions.
