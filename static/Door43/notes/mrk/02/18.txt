\v 18 The disciples of John \add the Baptizer\add* and some men who belonged to the Pharisee \add sect\add* used to abstain from food \add to show that they wanted to please God\add*.

\v 19 \add Jesus wanted them to understand that it was not appropriate for his disciples to show sorrow by abstaining from food while he was still with them\add*. So he said to them, "When a man is marrying a woman, his friends will certainly not abstain from food while he is still with them, will they \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? No. During the time that he is with them, they will not abstain from food \add because they are happy together\add*.

\v 18 Now at this time, the disciples of John the Baptizer and some men who belonged to the Pharisee sect were abstaining from food, as they often did. Some men came to Jesus and asked him, "The disciples of John and the Pharisees often abstain from food. Why do your disciples not abstain from food?"
\v 19 Jesus said to them, "When a man is marrying a woman, his friends will certainly not abstain from food while he is still with them. The wedding is a time of feasting and celebrating with the groom. It is not a time for abstaining from food, especially while the groom is with them.

\v 18 Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and said to him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
\v 19 Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding attendants fast while the bridegroom is still with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus tells parables to show why his disciples should not fast while he is with them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])


  * **the Pharisees were fasting ... the disciples of the Pharisees** - These two phrases refer to the same group of people, but the second is more specific. Both refer to the  followers of the Pharisee sect, but they do not focus on the leaders of the Pharisees. AT: "the disciples of the Pharisees were fasting ... the disciples of the Pharisees"
  * **Some people** - "Some men." It is best to translate this phrase without specifying exactly who these men are. If in your language you have to be more specific, the possible meanings are 1) these men were not among John's disciples or the disciples of the Pharisees or 2) these men were among John's disciples. 
  * **came and said to him** - "came and said to Jesus" 
  * **Can the wedding attendants fast while the bridegroom is still with them?** - Jesus uses this question to remind the people of something they already know and to encourage them to apply it to him and his disciples.  AT: "Wedding attendants do not fast while the bridegroom is with them. Rather they celebrate and feast." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
