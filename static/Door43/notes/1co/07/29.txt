====== 1 Corinthians 07:29-31 ======

<usfm>
\v 29 My fellow believers, this is what I mean: There is not much time left \add before Christ returns\add*. So, from now on those men who are married should \add devote themselves to serving the Lord as much\add* as they would if they were not married.
\v 30 Those who are sad should \add devote themselves to serving the Lord as much\add* as they would if they were not sad. Those who are rejoicing \add should devote themselves to serving the Lord as much\add* as they would if they were not joyful.
\v 31 Those who are buying things should \add devote themselves to serving the Lord as much\add* as they would if they did not possess those things. Because this world as it exists now will soon be gone, those who are actively involved in the affairs of this life \add should not devote all their time\add* to be involved in those things.

\v 29 This is what I mean about the time in which we are living, brothers and sisters: we have a short amount of time left. From now on those who are married will have to live as though they were not married, because of all the trouble that is coming.
\v 30 Those who are filled with grief should not cry. Those who are rejoicing over some wonderful event should have no joy on their faces. Those who have spent money to buy something should take no delight in it; they should live as if they owned nothing.
\v 31 And those who deal with the things of the world should not involve themselves completely with them. For this world system is about to crumble into nothing.

\v 29 But this I say, brothers: The time is short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none.
\v 30 Those who weep should act as though they were not weeping, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who are buying anything as though they did not possess anything.
\v 31 And those who make use of the world should not act as though they are making total use of it, for the system of this world is coming to an end.
