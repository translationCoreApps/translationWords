  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to teach his disciples how to pray.

  * **Give us ... Forgive us ... Do not lead us** - These are imperatives, but they should be translated as requests, rather than as commands. It may be helpful to add something such as "please" to them to make this clear. AT: "Please give us ... Please forgive us ... Please do not lead us"
  * **our daily bread** - Bread was an inexpensive food that people ate everyday. It is used here to refer to food in general. AT: "the food we need each day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Forgive us our sins** - "Forgive us for sinning against you" or "Forgive our sins"
  * **as we forgive** - "since we also forgive"
  * **who is in debt to us** - "who has sinned against us" or "who has done wrong things to us"
