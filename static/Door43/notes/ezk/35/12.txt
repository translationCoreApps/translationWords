\v 12 So you will know that I am Yahweh. I have heard all the insults you spoke against the mountains of Israel, when you said, "They have been destroyed; they have been given over to us to devour."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues the message that Ezekiel is to speak to Mount Seir. The message is for all the people of Edom.

  * **against the mountains of Israel ... They have been destroyed; they have been given over to us to devour** - Here "mountains" represents the whole land of Israel. The phrases "have been destroyed" and "have been given over" can be stated in active form. AT: "against the land of Israel ... It is in ruins; we can now devour it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they have been given over to us to devour** - The people of Mount Seir taking the land of Israel and using it for themselves is spoken of as if they were wild animals that would devour the mountains of Israel. AT: "they are here for us to take control of them" or "we can take whatever we want from them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
