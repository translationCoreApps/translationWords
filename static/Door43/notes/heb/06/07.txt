\v 7 Think about this: It is land on which rain has frequently fallen \f + \ft personification \f* and on which plants grow \f + \ft personification \f* that is useful for the people who prepare the land that God has blessed. \add Similarly, it is those believers who have received many good things from God and who do good deeds\f + \ft Or: things \f* that please God, whom God will bless\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 8 But \add what will happen to believers who do deeds\f + \ft Or: things \f* that do not please God will be like what happens to land\add* on which \add only\add* thorns and thistles grow \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Such land\add* is worthless. It has almost become land that God will curse, and eventually he will burn \add its vegetation\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

\v 7 Think about this: God has blessed land on which rain has frequently fallen and on which plants grow for the farmers.
\v 8 But what will happen to believers who do not obey God is like what happens to land on which only thorns and thistles grow. Such land is worthless. It has become land that the farmer will curse and whose plants they will burn away.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 For the land that drinks in the rain that often comes on it, and that gives birth to the plants useful to those for whom the land was workedâ€”this is the land that receives a blessing from God.
\v 8 But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and is near to a curse. Its end is in burning.
