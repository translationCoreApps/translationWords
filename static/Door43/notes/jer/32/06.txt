===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Jeremiah said, "The word of Yahweh came to me and said, 'Look, Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is coming to you and will say, "Buy my field that is in Anathoth for yourself, for the right to buy it belongs to you."'"** - You may translate this as indirect speech. AT: "Jeremiah said that the word of Yahweh had come to him and told him that Hanamel son of Shallum his uncle was coming to him and would tell him to buy his uncle's field that was in Anathoth for himself, for the right to buy it belonged to Jeremiah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **Jeremiah said** - It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. You may translate using first person, as the UDB does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **The word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01|1:2]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Hanamel ... Shallum** - men's names (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Anathoth** - place name. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01|1:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
