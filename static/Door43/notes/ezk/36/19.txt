====== Ezekiel 36:19-21 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 I caused them to be scattered among many nations \f + \ft doublet \f*. I punished \f + \ft metonymy \f* them like they deserved to be punished beause of their very evil behavior \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\v 20 And wherever they went among those nations, they caused my reputation \f + \ft metonymy \f* to be disgraced. What has happened is that the people in those countries said about them, 'They belong to Yahweh, but they were forced to leave the land that he \add gave to them\add*.'
\v 21 But I was concerned about my reputation, which the people of Israel had disgraced among the nations to which they were forced to go.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 So I made their enemies scatter them into other lands. I punished them as they deserved to be punished because they had done so many evil things.
\v 20 Wherever they went among those lands, they caused other people to mock me, when they should have honored me. Those people have been saying, 'The Israelites belong to Yahweh, but he was not strong enough to protect them. They had to leave the land that he had given to them.'
\v 21 The people of Israel had disgraced me among the people groups to which they had to go, but I deserve that those people groups worship me instead.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 I scattered them among the nations; they were dispersed through the lands. I judged them according to their ways and their deeds.
\v 20 Then they went to the nations, and wherever they went, they profaned my holy name when people said of them, 'Are these really the people of Yahweh? For they have been thrown out of his land.'
\v 21 But I had compassion for my holy name that the house of Israel had defiled among the nations, when they went there.
