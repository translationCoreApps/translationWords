===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to your servant that you will build him a house** - David is refers to himself as "your servant." AT: "to me that you will build me a house" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **that you will build him a house** - Here the metonym "house" refers to David's ancestors continuing on as the rulers of Israel. In [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:07:03|7:4]] Yahweh asked David if he would be the one to build a house for Yahweh. There "house" represented a temple. If your language has a word that can express both ideas, use it here and in 7:4. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Now** - This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.
  * **your words are trustworthy** - Here "words" represents what Yahweh says. AT: "I trust what you say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **and with your blessing your servant's house will be blessed forever** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "and you will continue to bless my family forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **your servant's house** - Here David refers to himself as "your servant." AT: "my house" or "my family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **house** - Here "house" represents David's family. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
