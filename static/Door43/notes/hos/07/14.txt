\q2 They have rebelled against me. 
\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 They have not cried to me with all their heart,
\q but they wail on their beds.
\q They gather together for grain and new wine,
\q and they turn away from me.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa They gather together \fqa* , which the Hebrew text has, some ancient copies and many modern versions have \fqa They cut themselves \fqa* , an allusion to the pagan custom of idol worshipers wounding themselves in the frenzy of prayer. \f*
\q
\v 15 Though I trained them and strengthened their arms,
\q they are now plotting evil against me.

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking.

  * **they wail on their beds** - It was usual for idol worshipers to eat ceremonial meals while reclining on couches or beds. 
  * **Though I trained them and strengthened their arms** - This may be a military metaphor, in which God training the Israelites to love him and obey him is spoken of as if he had been training their men for war. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and they turn away from me** - Here no longer worshiping God is spoken of as turning away from him. AT: "and they no longer worship me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
