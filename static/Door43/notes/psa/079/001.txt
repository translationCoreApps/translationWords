  * **A psalm of Asaph** - "This is a psalm that Asaph wrote." See how this is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:050:001|50:1]].
  * **your inheritance** - "the land that was to be yours forever" See how this is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:068:009|68:9]].
  * **They have shed their blood like water** - The word "blood" is a metonym for innocent life. To shed blood is to kill innocent people. Most people saw water every day, so for blood to be as common as water, many innocent people would have to die. AT: "They have killed so many innocent people that the blood is everywhere, like water after it rains" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **none to bury them** - "none to bury the dead people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
