====== Jeremiah 02:29-31 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 You complain that it was wrong for me \add not to have rescued you\add*,
\q2 but you have all rebelled against me.
\q1
\v 30 I punished some of you,
\q2 but you did not learn anything from my doing that.
\q1 You have killed many of the prophets that I \add sent to you\add*,
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* fierce lions kill other animals.
\b
\p
\v 31 You people of Israel, pay attention to what I say.
\q1 I have certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* never \add abandoned you\add* in a desert;
\q2 I have never \add left you\add* in a very dark land.
\q1 So, why do you, my people, say 'We are free from God's control;
\q2 we will not return to \add worship\add* God anymore'?

\v 29 You complain that it was wrong for me not to have rescued you,
\q2 but you have all rebelled against me, Yahweh, the one who is speaking to you right now.
\q1
\v 30 I punished some of you,
\q2 but you did not learn anything from my doing that.
\q1 Instead you have killed many of the prophets that I sent to you,
\q2 like fierce lions kill other animals.
\b
\p
\v 31 You people of Israel, pay attention to what I say.
\q1 I have certainly never abandoned you in a desert;
\q2 I have never left you in a very dark land.
\q1 So, why do you, my people, say that you are free from my control
\q2 and that you will not return to worship me anymore?


\q1

<usfm>
\q
\v 29 So why do you accuse me of doing wrong? All of you have sinned against meâ€”this is Yahweh's declaration.
\q
\v 30 I have punished your people in vain. They would not accept discipline.
\q Your sword has devoured your prophets like a destructive lion!
\q
\v 31 You who belong to this generation! Pay attention to my word, the word of Yahweh! Have I been a wilderness to Israel?
\q Or a land of deep darkness? Why would my people say, 'Let us wander around, we will not go to you anymore'?
</usfm>
