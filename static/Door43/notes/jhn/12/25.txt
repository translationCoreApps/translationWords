\v 26 If \add any of these Greeks or\add* anyone \add else\add* wants to serve me, they must become my disciples. Then, \add after they die\add*, they will be where I am, \add in heaven\add*. My Father will honor all those who serve me.

\v 25 Anyone who tries to live to please himself will fail, but anyone who does not live to please himself will keep his life forever.

  * **He who loves his life will lose it** - Here "loves his life" means to consider one's own physical life to be more valuable than the lives of others. AT: "whoever values his own life more than others will not receive eternal life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life** - Here the one who "hates his life" refers to one who loves his own life less than he loves the lives of others. AT: "whoever considers the lives of others as more important than his own life will live with God forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **where I am, there will my servant also be** - Jesus implies that those who serve him will be with him in heaven. AT: "when I am in heaven, my servant will also be there with me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the Father will honor him** - Here "Father" is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
