\v 9 The king was distressed because he now knew he should not have made that promise to her\add .

\v 8 So Herodias' daughter went and asked her mother what to ask for. Her mother told her what to say. So her daughter went back and said to Herod, "I want you to cut off the head of John the Baptizer and bring it here on a platter to show that he is really dead!"
\v 9 The king was now very sorry that he had promised to give Herodias' daughter whatever she wanted. But because he had called on God to hear him make that promise, and because all his guests had heard him do so, he felt that he had to do what he had said. So he ordered his servants to do what she wanted.

\v 8 After being instructed by her mother, she said, "Give me here, on a platter, the head of John the Baptist."
\v 9 The king was very upset by her request, but because of his oath, and because of all those at dinner with him, he ordered that it should be done.
