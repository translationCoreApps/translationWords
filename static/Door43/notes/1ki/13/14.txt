\v 14 The old prophet went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak tree; and he said to him, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" He answered, "I am."
\v 15 Then the old prophet said to him, "Come home with me and eat food."
\v 16 The man of God answered, "I may not return with you nor go in with you, neither will I eat food nor drink water with you in this place,
\v 17 because it was commanded to me by the word of Yahweh, 'You will eat no food nor drink water there, nor return by the way that you came.'"
