\v 32 No one has ever enabled a man to see who was blind when he was born \add like I was\add*. That has never happened since the world began!
\v 33 So if this man had not come from God, he would not be able to do anything \add like that\add*!"
\v 34 They replied to him, "You were born \add as a result of your parents'\add* sin \f + \ft euphemism \f*\f + \ft Or: bastard \f*! Do you think you are qualified to teach us?\f + \ft Or: You are not qualified to teach us! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" Then they threw him out \add of the synagogue\add*.

<usfm>
\v 32 Not since the beginning of the world has it been heard anywhere that someone was able to open the eyes of a man who was blind from birth!
\v 33 If this man had not come from God, he could do nothing like that!"
\v 34 They replied to him, "You were born in sin and have lived your whole life entirely in sin! Do you think you are qualified to teach us?" Then they banned him from the synagogue.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The man who had been blind continues speaking to the Jews.

  * **it has never been heard that anyone opened** - This is a passive statement. You can translate it in an active form. AT: "no one has ever heard of anyone who healed a man who was blind from birth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **If this man were not from God, he could do nothing** - This sentence uses a double negative pattern. "Only a man from God could do something like that!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **You were completely born in sins, and you are teaching us?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. It also implies that the man was born blind because of the sins of his parents. AT: "You were born as a result of your parents' sins. You are not qualified to teach us!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **they threw him out** - "they threw him out of the synagogue"
