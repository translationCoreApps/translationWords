\v 9 Then the king sent a captain with fifty soldiers to Elijah. The captain went up to Elijah where he was sitting on the top of a hill. The captain spoke to him, "You, man of God, the king has said, 'Come down.'"
\v 10 Elijah answered and said to the captain, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men." Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then the king sent a captain with fifty soldiers to Elijah** - The king sent the leader of the army with fifty men to bring Elijah back to him. AT: "Then the king sent a captain with fifty soldiers to seize Elijah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **fifty soldiers** - "50 soldiers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven** - The captain had called Elijah a man of God, but the captain and the king did not show Elijah proper respect. Elijah said this so that fire would come down from heaven, and this would prove that Elijah really was a man of God and he deserved their respect. AT: "Since I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven" or "If I am a man of God as you have said, let fire come down from heaven"
  * **heaven** - "the sky" (UDB)
