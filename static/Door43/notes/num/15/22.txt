<usfm>
\v 22 There may be times when you Israelites do not obey all these instructions that I have given to Moses to tell you, but not because you intended to disobey them.
\v 23 There may be times when some of your descendants do not obey all these instructions that I have given to Moses to tell to you.
\v 24 If you or they sin \add by forgetting to obey these instructions\add* and none of the Israelite people realize that they were doing that, one young bull as an offering for all the people \add must be brought to the priest\add*. That will be pleasing to me \add when it is burned on the altar\add*. They must also bring to me a grain offering and an offering of wine, and a male goat, to be sacrificed to remove the guilt of their sin.

\v 22 You will sometimes sin without intending to do so, when you do not obey all these commands that I have spoken to Mosesâ€”
\v 23 everything that I have commanded you through Moses from the day that I began to give you commands and onward throughout your people's generations.
\v 24 In the case of unintentional sin without the community's knowledge, then all the community must offer one young bull as a burnt offering to produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh. Along with this must be made a grain offering and drink offering, as commanded by the decree, and one male goat as a sin offering.
