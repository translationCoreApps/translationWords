\v 54 Because of that, Jesus no longer traveled around publicly among his Jewish opponents. Instead, he left Jerusalem and, with the disciples, went to a town called Ephraim in an area near the wilderness and desert region. There he stayed with his disciples for a while.
\p
\v 55 Now it was almost time for the Jewish Passover Celebration, and many worshipers went up from the country and the villages to Jerusalem. They would wash themselves in preparation, to make themselves clean according to the Jewish rules, so that they would be allowed to celebrate the Passover.

\v 54 No longer did Jesus walk openly among the Jews, but he departed from there into the country near to the wilderness into a town called Ephraim. There he stayed with the disciples.
\v 55 Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover in order to purify themselves.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus leaves Bethany and goes to Ephraim. In verse 55 the story shifts to telling about what many of the Jews are doing now that Passover is near.

  * **walk openly among the Jews** - Here "Jews" is a synecdoche for the Jewish leaders. AT: "walk openly among the Jewish leaders who opposed him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the country** - the rural area outside cities where fewer people live
  * **There he stayed with the disciples** - Jesus and his disciples stayed in Ephraim for a while. AT: "There he stayed with his disciples for a short period of time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **went up to Jerusalem** - The phrase "went up" is used here because Jerusalem is higher in elevation than the surrounding areas.
