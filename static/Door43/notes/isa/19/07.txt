===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The fishermen will wail and mourn, and all who cast a hook into the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will grieve** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The reason they are grieving can be made explicit. AT: "and the fishermen who try to catch fish with hooks or nets will cry in despair because all the fish in the Nile have died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
