\v 29 But Peter, speaking for himself and the other apostles, replied, "We have to obey what God commands us to do, not what you people tell us to do!
\v 30 You are the ones who killed Jesus by nailing him to a cross! But God, whom our ancestors worshiped, caused Jesus to become alive again after he died.
\v 31 God has honored Jesus more than anyone. He has made him the one to save us and rule over us. He has allowed us Israelites to stop sinning, so that he might forgive us for our sins.

\v 29 But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than men.
\v 30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree.
\v 31 God exalted him to his right hand to be a prince and a savior, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
\v 32 We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."
