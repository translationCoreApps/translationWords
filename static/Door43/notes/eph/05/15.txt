  * **Redeem the time** - "Do the best things you can with your time," "Use time wisely," or "Put time to its best use" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **because the days are evil** - The word "days" is a metonym for what people do during those days. AT: "because the people around you are doing all kinds of evil things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
