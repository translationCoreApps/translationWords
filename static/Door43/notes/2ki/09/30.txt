\v 30 When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it, and she painted her eyes, arranged her hair, and looked out the window.
\v 31 As Jehu was entering the gate, she said to him, "Are you coming in peace, you Zimri, your master's murderer?"
\v 32 Jehu looked up at the window and said, "Who is on my side? Who?" Then two or three eunuchs looked out.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **painted her eyes, arranged her hair** - "put on makeup, made her hair look nice"
  * **Are you coming in peace, you Zimri, your master's murderer?** - Jezebel uses this rhetorical question to accuse Jehu of not coming peacefully. This can be written as a statement. AT: "You are certainly not coming in peace, you Zimri, your master's murderer!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **you Zimri, your master's murderer** - Here Jezebel calls Jehu "Zimri" to say that he is a murderer. Zimri was a commander of the army of Israel who murdered the king of Israel because he wanted to be king. AT: "you murdered your master, just like Zimri murdered his master" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Zimri** - This is the name of a man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Who is on my side** - To "be on someone's side" means to be loyal to them and supportive of them. AT: "Who is loyal to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
