  * **can anyone understand the extensive spread of the clouds and the thunder from his hut?** - Elihu asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that no one can do these things. AT: "no one can understand the extensive spread of the clouds and the thunder from his hut." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the extensive spread of the clouds** - The phrase "the extensive spread" can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "how the clouds spread across the sky" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **from his hut** - Elihu speaks of the sky as if it were a "hut" in which God lives. AT: "from the sky, where God lives" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
