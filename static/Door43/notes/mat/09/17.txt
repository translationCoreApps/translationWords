\v 17 Neither does anyone pour fresh grape juice into old skin bags to store it. If anyone did that, those skin bags would tear when the juice became wine. The bags would be ruined, and the wine would be spilled on the ground. Instead, people put new wine into new skin bags, and the bags will stretch when the wine ferments. In this way, both the wine and the bags will be safe."

\v 17 Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will be spilled, and the wineskins will be destroyed. Instead, they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both will be preserved."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to answer the question that disciples of John had asked.

  * **Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins** - Jesus uses another proverb to answer John's disciples. This means the same as the proverb in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:09:16|9:16]].
  * **Neither do people put** - "Neither does anyone pour" (UDB) or "People never put"
  * **new wine** - This refers to wine that has not fermented yet. If grapes are unknown in your area, use the general term for fruit. AT: "grape juice" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **old wineskins** - This refers to wineskins that have been used many times.
  * **wineskins** - "wine bags" or "skin bags" (UDB). These were bags made out of animal skins.
  * **the wine will be spilled, and the wineskins will be destroyed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "and this will ruin the wineskin and spill the wine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the skins will burst** - When the new wine ferments and expands, the skins tear open because they can no longer stretch out.
  * **fresh wineskins** - "new wineskins" or "new wine bags." This refers to wineskins that no one has used.
  * **both will be preserved** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "this will keep safe both the wineskin and the wine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
