====== 1 Samuel 22 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

There are two stories in this chapter: David gathering a group of followers and Saul having all the priests and their families killed. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:priest]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== David assembles a force of unhappy people ==
David hid in the wilderness and people in trouble came to him. Soon, he had a force of 500 men. The prophet then told him to leave the wilderness. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

== Saul and the High Priest's family ==
Doeg tells Saul that the High Priest gave David food and a sword and prayed for him. Saul accused the priests of encouraging David to rebel. This was a serious accusation because they were God's representatives and were rebelling against God's king. Saul had the priests and all their families killed except those who escape to David. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:highpriest]])
