===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh ... Jeshimon?** - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You should already know that David is hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh ... Jeshimon." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **surrender him into the king's hand** - The word "hand" is a metonym for power. The Ziphites speak to Saul as if he were another man to show him that they respect him. AT: "give David to you so you can do whatever you desire with him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
