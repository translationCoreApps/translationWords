\q
\v 5 See, these poor people go out to their work
\q like wild donkeys in the wilderness, looking carefully for food;
\q perhaps the Arabah will provide them food for their children.
\q
\v 6 Poor people reap in the night in other people's fields;
\q they glean grapes from the harvest of those wicked people.
\q
\v 7 They lie naked all night without clothing;
\q they have no covering in the cold.
