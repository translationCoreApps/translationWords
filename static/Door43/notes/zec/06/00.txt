====== Zechariah 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is written mainly in prose and tells the last vision of the four chariots in the first part of the chapter. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 6:12-15, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Crown ==
The second part of the chapter is about a crown made for the high priest. This is an actual person, but the meaning of the word "branch" should be translated as his name. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:highpriest]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Meaning of the visions ==
The visions are stated and even when the prophet asked for an explanation, their true meaning is often obscure. This uncertainty should remain in your translation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])
