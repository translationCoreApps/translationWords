\v 27 "You hypocrites, you men who teach the laws and you Pharisees, how terribly God will punish you! You are like buildings over people's graves, buildings that are painted white so that people can see them and avoid touching them. The outside of those tombs are beautiful, but inside they are full of dead people's bones and filth.
\v 28 You are like those tombs. When people look at you, they think that you are righteous, but in your inner beings you are hypocrites, because you disobey God's commands."

\v 27 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which on the outside look beautiful, but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.
\v 28 In the same way, you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **you are like whitewashed tombs ... unclean** - This is a simile that means the scribes and Pharisees may appear to be pure on the outside, but they are wicked on the inside. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **whitewashed tombs** - "tombs that someone has painted white." The Jews would paint tombs white so that people would easily see them and avoid touching them. Touching a tomb would make a person ceremonially unclean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
