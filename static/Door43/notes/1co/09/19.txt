====== 1 Corinthians 09:19-20 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 I am not obligated to do what anyone else thinks that I should do. Nevertheless, when I have been with any group of people, I have made myself \add do what they believed that I should do, just like a slave does what his master wants him to do\add*. I have done that in order that I might convince more people \add to trust in Christ\add*.
\v 20 Specifically, when I was with fellow Jews, I did the things that Jews \add think that people should do\add*. I did that in order that I might convince some of them \add to trust in Christ\add*. Although I am now not obligated to obey the Jewish laws and rituals, when I was with those who believe that they are obligated to obey those laws, I did the things that they \add think that people should do\add*. I did that in order to convince some of them \add to trust in Christ\add*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 I am not obligated to anyone, but I am a servant to everyone, so that I might persuade more and more people to trust in Christ.
\v 20 When working with Jewish people, I become like a Jew, so that I may win them to Christ. To those who were living under the law I lived as they lived, in order that those living under the law may trust in Christ as I trust in him. I lived as they lived, even though I am not living my life by the law's demands.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 For though I am free from all, I became a servant to all, in order that I might win more.
\v 20 To the Jews I became like a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law, I became like one under the law in order to win those under the law. I did this even though I myself was not under the law.
\f + \ft The ULB and UDB read, \fqa I did this even though I was not under the law myself. \fqb Some older versions leave this passage out. \f*
