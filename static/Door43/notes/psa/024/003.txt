===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Who will ascend the mountain ... in his holy place?** - Both of these questions mean basically the same thing. The speaker is asking about who is allowed to go and worship Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **ascend** - "go up" or "climb"
  * **the mountain of Yahweh** - This refers to Mount Zion in Jerusalem.
  * **his holy place** - This refers Yahweh's temple. His temple is on Mount Zion in Jerusalem.
  * **He who has ... who has ... and has not** - Here "He" does not refer to a specific person. AT: "Those who have ... who have ... and have not" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **who has clean hands** - The word "hands" represents what a person does. For his "hands" to be clean means he does what is right. AT: "who does what is right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a pure heart** - Here "heart" represents a person's thoughts or motives. AT: "thinks good thoughts" or "does not think about doing what is wrong" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
