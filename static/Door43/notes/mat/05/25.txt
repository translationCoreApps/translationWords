\v 25 \add Also\add*, when a fellow citizen \add takes you to court in order to\add* accuse you, settle accounts with that person quickly while you are walking with that person on the road. Do that \add while there still is time to do so\add* in order that he will not take you to the judge\add , because if\add* the judge \add favors the person who is accusing you, he will declare that you are guilty and send you\add* to the prison guard, and the prison guard will put you in prison.
\v 26 Keep this in mind: \add If you go to prison\add*, you will never get out \add because you will never be able to\add* pay all that the judge says that you owe \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add And remember also that\add* you \add ought to settle accounts with God before you die, too\add*."

<usfm>
\v 25 If a fellow citizen takes you to court in order to accuse you of doing something wrong, come to an agreement quickly with that person, while you are still walking with that person to court. Do that while there still is time so that he will not take you to the judge, because the judge might say you are guilty and hand you over to the prison guard, and the prison guard will put you in prison.
\v 26 Keep this in mind: if you go to prison, you will never get out because you will never be able to pay all that the judge says that you owe. So remember also to be at peace with your brothers."

<usfm>
\v 25 Agree with your accuser quickly while you are with him on the way to court, or your accuser may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.
\v 26 Truly I say to you, you will never come out from there until you have paid the last bit of money you owe.
