====== Nehemiah 08 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Reading of the Law ==

During the exile, the Hebrew language was no longer spoken. Only the priests and Levites still understood it. Ezra read the book of the law to the people in Hebrew and the Levites ran up and down among the crowd translating it into Aramaic for the people to understand. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:priest]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]])

== Festival of Booths ==

The people made temporary shelters for themselves out of branches of trees to remember living in tents when they came out of slavery in Egypt. This is known as the Festival of Ingathering (ULB).
