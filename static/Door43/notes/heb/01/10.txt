<usfm>
\v 10 And \add we also know that his Son is superior to angels because in the Scriptures the Psalmist wrote that\add* someone said to God's Son,
\q Lord, it was you who created the earth in the beginning.
\q You also made \add the rest of\add* the universe \f + \ft Or: the \add things in\add* the sky \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\q
\v 11 Those things will perish, but you will keep on living \add forever\add*.
\q They will wear out as clothing \add wears out\add*.
\q
\v 12 You will dispose of them as one rolls up an \add old\add* coat \add to get rid of it\add*.
\q \add Then\add*, you will exchange \add all that is in the universe for something new\add*,
\q as someone puts on a new garment \add in exchange for an old garment\add* \f + \ft simile \f*.
\q But you \add are not like what you created\add*.
\q You stay the same, and you live forever \f + \ft litotes \f*!

\v 10 We also know that his Son is superior to angels because in the scriptures it is written about God's Son,
\q "Lord, it was you who created the earth in the beginning.
\q You also made the rest of the universe, the stars and everything in the sky.
\q
\v 11 Those things will no longer exist, but you will keep on living forever.
\q They will wear out as clothing wears out.
\q
\v 12 You will roll them up as if they were old clothes.
\q Then you will change all that is in the universe for something new,
\q like someone putting on new clothes.
\q But you stay the same, and you live forever!"

\q
\v 10 "In the beginning, Lord, you laid the earth's foundation.
\q The heavens are the work of your hands.
\q
\v 11 They will perish, but you will continue.
\q They will all wear out like a piece of clothing.
\q
\v 12 You will roll them up like a cloak,
\q and they will be changed like a piece of clothing.
\q But you are the same,
\q and your years do not end."
