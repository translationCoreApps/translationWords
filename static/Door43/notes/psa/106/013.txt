===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they did not wait for his instructions** - It is implied that they did things without waiting to find out what Yahweh wanted them to go. AT: "they did things without first waiting for Yahweh's instructions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **insatiable cravings** - "cravings that could not be satisfied" 
  * **they challenged God** - "They rebelled against God"
  * **consumed** - "overtook" or "took over"
  * **but sent a disease** - Here David speaks about Yahweh causing the people to be afflicted by a disease as if Yahweh sent a disease to them in the same way that someone sends a person or a messenger. AT: "but he caused a disease to consume their bodies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
