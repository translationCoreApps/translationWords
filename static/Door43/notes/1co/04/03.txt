====== 1 Corinthians 04:3-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 I am not concerned whether you or \add the judges in\add* some court decide whether I have done my work faithfully or not. I do not even judge myself \add about that\add*.
\v 4 I do not think that I have done anything wrong, but that does not prove that I have done nothing wrong. The Lord is the one who judges me.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 If a human being, or even a court of law, judges my life, I think little about it. I do not consider it worthwhile to judge myself.
\v 4 I am not aware of anyone who accuses me of doing wrong. But that does not mean that I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 But for me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. For I do not even judge myself.
\v 4 I am not aware of any charge being made against me, but that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you** - Paul is comparing the difference between human judgment and God's judgment. Man's judgment is not important compared to God's true judgment upon man.
  * **I am not aware of any charge being made against me** - "I have not heard anyone accuse me of doing wrong"
  * **that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me** - "that lack of accusation does not prove I am innocent. The Lord knows if I am innocent or guilty"
