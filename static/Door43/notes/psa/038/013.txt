===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I am like a deaf man ... hear nothing ... does not hear** - The first lines of verse 13 and 14 use a simile to present the same image of the deaf man. The writer is so sick that he cannot hear. (See:  [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **I am like a mute man ... says nothing ... has no reply** - The second lines of verses 13 and 14 use a simile to present the image of the mute man. The writer is so sick that he cannot speak. (See:  [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
