\v 20 When he has finished atoning for the most holy place, the tent of meeting, and the altar, he must present the live goat.
\v 21 Aaron must lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over him all the wickedness of the people of Israel, all their rebellion, and all their sins. Then he must put that sinfulness on the head of the goat and send the goat away in the care of a man who is ready to lead the goat into the wilderness.
\v 22 The goat must carry on himself all the people's wickedness to a solitary place. There in the wilderness, the man must let the goat go free.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he must present the live goat** - This is the same as the scapegoat mentioned in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:16:08|16:10]].
  * **confess over him** - "confess over the goat"
  * **he must put that sinfulness on the head of the goat** - Aaron's actions here were a symbolic transfer of the people's sin to the goat as a sign that the goat would bear the punishment for their guilt. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **wickedness ... rebellion ... sins** - These all mean basically the same thing. Aaron is confessing every kind of sin that the people committed.
