===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This is the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh** - After this phrase, the reader will expect to see the content of the message from Yahweh. However, the actual message does not begin until [[:en:bible:notes:jer:34:12|39:12]]. For this reason, the translator may choose to follow the example of the UDB by moving the phrase from here to verse 12, either combining all verses into 8-12 or explaining the change in a note.
  * **word** - "message" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **after King Zedekiah had made a covenant ... his brother** - These words all provide background information to events that will be described later. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
