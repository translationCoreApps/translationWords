====== 1 Samuel 23 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Saul chasing David ==
Saul wanted to  kill David, but David trusted in God and God kept rescuing David. David rescued the town of Keilah from the Philistines who were stealing their harvest. So, Saul went to Keilah to capture David. David fled to the wilderness near Ziph. When David fled deeper into the wilderness and Saul followed, he had to leave to fight the Philistines who had invaded. This showed Saul cared more about killing his enemies than pleasing God. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])    


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metonymy ==
Jonathan strengthened David with a synecdoche: "For the hand of Saul my father will not find you." This helped to strengthen David's faith. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])
