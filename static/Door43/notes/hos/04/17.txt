===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is talking about Israel.

  * **Ephraim united himself with idols; leave him alone** - Here "Ephraim" refers to the people in the northern kingdom of Israel. They chose to worship idols, instead of Yahweh. Yahweh is commanding Hosea to not try correct them. The people of Israel will not listen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **her rulers dearly love their shame** - The rulers are not ashamed of what they are doing when they worship idols and turn against Yahweh.
  * **The wind will wrap her up in its wings** - Here "wind" represents God's judgment and anger against the nation of Israel. Yahweh will allow the enemy army to defeat the people of Israel and take them as captives. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
