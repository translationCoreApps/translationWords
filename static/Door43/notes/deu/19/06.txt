\v 6 Because he accidentally killed someone, and because the man was not his enemy, he can try to run to one of those cities. If there were only one city, it may be a long distance to that city. Then if the relative of the man who was killed \f + \ft metonymy \f*, the man who is supposed\f + \ft Or: expected \f* to get revenge, is very angry, he may be able to catch the other person before he arrives at that city.
\v 7 \add To prevent that from happening\add*, you must choose three cities, not only one, \add in order that someone can get to one of those cities quickly\add*.

<usfm>
\v 6 Otherwise the avenger of blood might go after the one who took a life, and in the heat of his anger overtake him, if the distance is too great, strike him and kill him, even though that man did not deserve to die, since he had not hated his neighbor in the past.
\v 7 Therefore I command you to select three cities for yourself.

  * **the avenger of blood** - Here "blood" represents the person who was killed. An "avenger of blood" is a close relative of the person who was killed. This relative is responsible for punishing the murderer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the one who took a life** - This is an idiom. AT: "the one who killed the other person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **in the heat of his anger** - Someone being very angry is spoken of as if anger were something that could become hot. AT: "and being very angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **strike him and kill him** - "And the blood avenger strikes and kills the one who had killed the other person"
  * **though that man did not deserve to die, since he had not hated his neighbor in the past** - "though that man did not deserve to die since he accidentally killed the other person and was not his enemy, and he had not planned to hurt the man"
