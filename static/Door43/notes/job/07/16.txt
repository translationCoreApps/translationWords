===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The writer continues to use parallelism in these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize the impact of Job's misery on his sense of self worth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **I loathe my life** - "I despise my life"
  * **to always be alive** - "to live forever"
  * **my days are useless** - "my days are pointless" or "the days of my life are empty"
  * **What is man that ... every moment?** - Job asks this question to emphasize that he wonders why God pays attention to people. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "Tell me what man is that ... every moment." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **set your mind on him** - Here the mind represents thoughts and attention. To "set your mind on" means to give attention to. AT: "direct your attention to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **observe him** - "carefully examine him"
