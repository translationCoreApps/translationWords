</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 It is dangerous to declare that something is holy to Yahweh,

\q1
\v 26 A king who is wise will separate the wicked from among his people;
\q2 then he will drive a threshing cart over their bodies to kill them.

<usfm>
\q
\v 25 It is a snare for a person to say rashly, "This thing is holy,"

\q and he turns a threshing wheel over them.
