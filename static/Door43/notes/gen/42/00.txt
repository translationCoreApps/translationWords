====== Genesis 42 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Famine ==
Apparently this famine extended beyond Egypt and encompassed the land of Canaan too. Because of Egypt's size and power, it would not have been unusual for people to go there in times of need. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== Joseph's test ==
Joseph tests his brothers to see if they are good. They treat their brother Benjamin better than they treated Joseph and tried to protect him.
