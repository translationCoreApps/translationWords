<usfm>
\v 22 It was because Yahweh could no longer endure\f + \ft Or: tolerate \f* your wicked actions and the detestable things that you were doing that he caused your land to be \add a place whose name people say when they\add* curse someone, a land that is ruined and which has no one living in it. And your land is still like that.
\v 23 It is because you burned incense to \add worship\f + \ft Or: honor \f*\add* idols and committed other sins against Yahweh that you experienced all those disasters. It is because you have not obeyed him or obeyed his laws and decrees and commandments."

\v 22 Then he was no longer able to bear it because of your wicked practices, because of the abominations that you did. Then your land became a desolation, a horror, and a curse so there was no longer an inhabitant as at this present day.
\v 23 Because you burned incense and sinned against Yahweh, and because you would not listen to his voice, his law, his statutes, or his covenant decrees, this disaster against you has happened as at this present day."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **was no longer able to bear it** - "was no longer able to tolerate it"
  * **because of the abominations that you did** - The abstract noun "abominations" can be stated as "things he hated." AT: "because you did things that he hated" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Then your land became a desolation, a horror, and a curse so there was no longer an inhabitant as at this present day** - This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "a desolation," "a horror," and "a curse." AT: "Then Yahweh caused it so that no one lives in the land. He made it a desolate and horrifying place. People use its name to curse others. And this is how it is even to this day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **burned incense** - Why people burn incense can be stated clearly. AT: "burned incense to false gods" (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **you would not listen to his voice** - Here "voice" refers to Yahweh's commands. AT: "you would not obey his commands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
