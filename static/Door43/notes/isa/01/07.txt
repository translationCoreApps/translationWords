===== translationNotes: =====


  * **your fields—in your presence, strangers are destroying them** - "people who are not from your own country steal the crops in your fields while you watch"
  * **abandoned devastation** - "empty and devastated."  This can be reworded so that the abstract nouns "abandoned devastation" are expressed as the verbs " destroyed" and "lives."  AT: "they have destroyed the land and no one lives there" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **overthrown by strangers** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "strangers have overthrown your country" or "a foreign army has completely conquered it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **The daughter of Zion** - The "daughter" of a city means the people of the city. AT: "The people of Zion" or "The people who live in Zion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **is left like a hut in a vineyard, like a shed in a garden of cucumbers** - "is like a hut in a vineyard or a shed in a garden of cucumbers." A "hut" and a "shed" are shelters that farmers built in the field during the harvest season. After the harvest, the farmers left them, and they quickly fell apart. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **like a besieged city** - This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "Her enemies have surrounded the city"
