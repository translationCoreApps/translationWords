\v 24 Nathan said, "My master the king, have you said, 'Adonijah will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne?'
\v 25 For he has gone down today and sacrificed oxen, fatted calves, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons, the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. They are eating and drinking before him, and saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Nathan the prophet continues to speak to King David.

  * **have you said, 'Adonijah will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne?'** - This can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "have you said that Adonijah will reign after you, and he will sit on your throne?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **he will sit on my throne** - Sitting on the throne is a metonym for being king. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:01:13|1:13]]. AT: "he will be king just as I was"
  * **eating and drinking before him** - Adonijah probably sat at a table where he could watch all those he had invited as they ate and drank. The main idea is that the people Nathan named were with Adonijah and they were celebrating together. AT: "eating and drinking with him" or "eating and drinking where he can see them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
