===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Hannah continues to recite a song to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **there is no rock like our God** - This is another way of saying that God is strong and faithful. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **rock** - This is a rock large enough to hide behind or to stand on and so be high above one's enemies.
