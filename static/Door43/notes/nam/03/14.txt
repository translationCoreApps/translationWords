\v 14 Store up water now to use when your enemies surround the city!
 Repair the forts!
 Dig up clay and trample it to make it soft,
 and put it into molds to make bricks to repair the walls!
\v 15 Nevertheless, your enemies will burn your city;
 they will kill you with their swords;
 they will kill you as locusts destroy crops.
\p
 Go ahead and increase your population like swarms of locusts and grasshoppers.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 Go draw water for the siege; strengthen your fortresses; 
\q go into the clay and tread the mortar; 
\q pick up the molds for the bricks.
\q
\v 15 Fire will devour you there, and the sword will destroy you. It will devour you as young locusts devour everything. 
\p
\q Make yourselves as many as the young locusts, as many as the full-grown locusts.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Nahum speaks to the people of Nineveh as though they were the city itself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])

  * **It will devour you as young locusts devour everything** - It will destroy as locusts devour everything in their path. See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **It** - the "fire" and "sword"
  * **Make yourselves as many as the young locusts, as many as the full-grown locusts** - "Multiply yourself like young locusts! Multiply yourself like adult locusts!" These words probably begin a new paragraph.
  * **Make yourselves as many as the young locusts** - This means they would become a very large city with many people and destroy many lands. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
