===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah continues praying the introduction to his lament to Yahweh.

  * **for your eyes are open to all the ways of people** - Open eyes are a metonym for what the person sees. How a person lives is spoken of as if he were walking on a path. AT: "You see everything that people do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to give to each man what his conduct and deeds deserve** - The abstract nouns "conduct" and "deeds," which are similar in meaning, can be translated as verbs. AT: "and will reward everyone according to how good or evil the things they do are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **You did signs and wonders in the land of Egypt** - This refers to an event in the past when God used his power to free the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt.
  * **To this present day** - "To this day"
  * **and among all mankind** - "and among all people"
  * **you have made your name famous** - Here "name" refers to God's reputation. AT: "you have made yourself famous" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **with a strong hand, with a raised arm** - The phrase "strong hand" is a metonym for strength, and the phrase "raised arm" is a metonym for the strength of the arm, so the phrases "strong hand" and "raised arm" form a doublet. AT: "by your great strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
