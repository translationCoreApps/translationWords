===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The story of Saul continues but Luke introduces another man named Ananias. This is not the same Ananias who died earlier in Acts  [[:en:bible:notes:act:05:03|5:3]]. You may translate it the same way though as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:act:05:01|5:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **General Information:** - Though there is more than one  Judas mentioned in the New Testament, it is likely this is the only appearance of this Judas.

  * **Now there was** - This introduces Ananias as a new character. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **And he said** - "And Ananias said"
  * **go to the street which is called Straight** - "go to Straight Street" (UDB)
  * **house of Judas** - This Judas is not the disciple who betrayed Jesus. This Judas was owner of a house in Damascus where Saul was staying. 
  * **a man from Tarsus named Saul** - "a man from the city of Tarsus named Saul" or "Saul of Tarsus"
  * **laying his hands on him** - This was a symbol of giving a spiritual blessing to Saul. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **he might see again** - "he might regain his ability to see"
