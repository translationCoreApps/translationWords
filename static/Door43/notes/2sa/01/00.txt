Some translations prefer to set apart quotations, songs and poems. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 1:19-27, which is a song.

This chapter continues the material from 1 Samuel. 


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== David's funeral song ==
David praised Saul and Jonathan as great warriors and Jonathan as his dearest friend. 


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===


== Synecdoche ==
David used two figures of speech to express that Jonathan and Saul were great warriors: "the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
