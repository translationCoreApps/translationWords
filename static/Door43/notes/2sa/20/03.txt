\v 3 When David arrived at the palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten slave wives whom he had left there to take care of the palace and put them in another house. He put a guard at that house, and he provided for them what they needed, but he never had sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with them again. So they remained shut up in their house until they died. It was as though they were widows.

He provided for their needs, but he did not sleep with them any longer. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living as if they were widows.
