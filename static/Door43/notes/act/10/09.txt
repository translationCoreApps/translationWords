\v 9 Now on the next day at about the sixth hour, as they were on their journey and were approaching the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray.
\v 10 He then became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while the people were cooking some food, he was given a vision,
\v 11 and he saw the sky open and a certain container descending, something like a large sheet coming down to the earth, let down by its four corners.
\v 12 In it were all kinds of four-footed animals and things that crawled on the earth, and birds of the sky.
