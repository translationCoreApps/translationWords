===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in the middle of everyone** - "in the middle of this crowd"
  * **Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath ... or to kill?** - Jesus said this to challenge them. He wanted them to acknowledge that it is lawful to heal people on the Sabbath. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to do good on the Sabbath day or to do harm ... to save a life, or to kill** - These two phrases are similar in meaning, except that the second is more extreme. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **to save a life, or to kill** - It may be helpful to repeat "is it lawful," as that is the question Jesus is asking again in another way. AT: "is it lawful to save a life or to kill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **a life** - This refers to physical life and is a metonym for a person. AT: "someone from dying" or "someone's life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **But they were silent** - "But they refused to answer him"
