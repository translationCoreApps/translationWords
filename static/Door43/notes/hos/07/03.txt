\q2 and the king's officials are happy when they tell lies.
\q1
\v 4 They are all sexually immoral;

\q
\v 3 With their evil they make the king glad,
\q and by their lies the officials.
\q
\v 4 They are all adulterers,
\q like an oven heated by the baker,
\q who ceases to stir the fire
\q from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
\q
\v 5 On the day of our king the officials made themselves sick with the heat of wine.
\q He reached out with his hand to those who were mocking.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking. The Hebrew text is not clear in various places. However, many people interpret it as describing the royal officials as being unfaithful to God, and also as planning to assassinate the king, and then carrying out their plans. This seems to have happened more than once. These crimes are mentioned as illustrations of the wickedness into which the nation has sunk.

  * **They are all adulterers** - The people committed spiritual adultery by worshiping idols and being unfaithful to Yahweh. They were probably also being unfaithful to their husbands or wives by sleeping with other people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **like an oven heated by the baker** - This can be stated in active form. This means the people had strong desires to do evil. AT: "like an oven which the baker heats" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **kneading of the dough** - This is a part of the process of making bread.
  * **On the day of our king** - This is perhaps a festival held by the king.
  * **He reached out with his hand** - This probably means to unite or join with someone. It may mean that the king joins with his officials to mock things or people that should not be mocked, even God himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
