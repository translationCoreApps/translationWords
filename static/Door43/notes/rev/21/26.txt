<usfm>
\v 26 The people of the world will also bring their wealth into the city.
\v 27 Nothing that is morally impure, no one who does deeds that God considers detestable, and no one who tells lies will ever enter that city. Only those people whose names are written in the book that belongs to the lamb, the book that has the names of people who have eternal life, will be there.

<usfm>
\v 26 They will bring the splendor and the honor of the nations into it,
\v 27 and nothing unclean will ever enter into it. Neither will anyone who commits anything shameful or deceitful enter, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They will bring** - "The kings of the earth will bring"

  * **but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "but only those whose names the Lamb wrote in his Book of Life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the Lamb** - This is a young male sheep. Here is it used symbolically to refer to Christ. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:05:06|5:6]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
