\v 9 Then I said to them, "What you are doing is terrible \f + \ft euphemism \f*! You certainly ought to \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* obey God and do what is right! If you did that, our enemies who do not have an awesome respect for Yahweh \add would see that we are doing what is right and\add* would not ridicule us.
\v 10 I and my fellow Jews and my servants have lent money and grain to people. But we all should stop charging interest on these loans.
\v 11 Also, you must give back to them their fields, their vineyards, their olive tree orchards, and their houses that you have taken from them. You must also give back to them the interest that you charged them when they borrowed money, grain, wine, and \add olive\add* oil from you, and you must do it today!"

\v 9 Then I said to them, "What you are doing is terrible. Should you not obey God and do what is right? If you did, you would prevent our enemies from treating us with disrepect.
\v 10 I and my fellow Jews and my servants have lent money and grain to people. But let us all stop charging interest on any of these loans.
\v 11 Also, you must give back to them their fields, their vineyards, their olive tree orchards, and their houses that you have taken from them. You must also give back to them the interest that you charged them when they borrowed money, grain, wine, and olive oil from you. You must do this today!"

\v 9 Also I said, "What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God to prevent the taunts of the nations that are our enemies?
\v 10 I and my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. But we must stop charging interest on these loans.
\v 11 Return to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their houses and the percentage of the money, the grain, the new wine, and the oil that you exacted from them."
