\v 36 Yahweh will take you and the king whom you will place over yourself to a nation that you have not known, neither you nor your ancestors; there you will worship other gods of wood and stone.
\v 37 You will become a source of horror, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples where Yahweh will lead you away.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples where Yahweh will lead you away** - The words "proverb" and "byword" mean basically the same thing. This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "and people will make up proverbs and bywords about you" or "Yahweh will send you to peoples who will laugh at you and ridicule you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **byword** - a word or phrase that people use to shame others
