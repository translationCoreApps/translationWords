\v 5 â€”then you must bring that man or woman, who has done this evil thing, to your city gates, that very man or woman, and you must stone that person to death. 
\v 6 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, will he who must die be put to death; but at the mouth of only one witness he must not be put to death.
\v 7 The hand of the witnesses must be the first to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people; and you will remove the evil from among you.
