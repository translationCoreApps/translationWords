===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Has he promised anything without doing it? Has he said he would do something without carrying it out?** - Both of these questions mean the same thing and emphasize that God does what he says he will. These rhetorical questions can be translated as statements. AT: "He has never promised a thing without fulfilling what he promised. He has always done exactly what he said he would do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **I have been commanded to bless** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God has commanded me to bless the Israelites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
