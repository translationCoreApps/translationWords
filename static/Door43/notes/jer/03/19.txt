\q
\v 19 As for me, I said, 'How I want to honor you as my son and give you a pleasant land,
\q an inheritance more beautiful than what is in any other nation!' I would have said, 'You will call me "my father".'
\q I would have said that you would not turn from following me.
\q
\v 20 But like a woman faithless to her husband,
\q you have betrayed me, house of Israelâ€”this is Yahweh's declaration."
