====== Joshua 20:5-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 If some relative of the one who was killed comes to that city to get revenge, the leaders of that city must not allow the relative to take the killer, because what happened was accidental. He did not deliberately hate that person and as a result deliberately kill him.
\v 6 But the person who killed someone else must stay in that city until the city judges put him on trial. \add Only\add* if the judges decide \add that the person who has run\f + \ft Or: escaped \f* to their city did not deliberately kill the other person will they allow him to stay in that city\add*, and he must stay there until the supreme priest dies. Then he may safely go back to his own town, \add because the death of the supreme priest will be considered to atone\f + \ft Or: pay \f* for the death of the person who was killed\add*."

\v 5 If some relative of the dead person comes to that city to get revenge, the leaders of that city must not allow the relative to take the killer, because what happened was accidental. He did not hate that person; he did not deliberately kill him.
\v 6 The person who killed someone else must stay in that city until the city judges put him on trial. Only if the judges decide that the person who has run to their city did not deliberately kill the other person will they allow him to stay in that city, and he must stay there until the high priest who was serving at the time of the offense dies. Then the man may safely go back to his own home."

<usfm>
\v 5 If one of them comes to try to avenge the blood of the person who was killed, then the people of the city must not hand the one who killed him over to the authorities. They must not do this because he killed his neighbor unintentionally, and he had no hatred toward him in the past.
\v 6 He must stay in that city until he has stood before the assembly for judgment, until the death of the one who was serving as high priest in those days. Then the one who had accidentally killed the person may return to his own town and his own home, to the town from which he fled.'"
