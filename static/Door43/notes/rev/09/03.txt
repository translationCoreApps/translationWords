\v 3 Locusts also came out of the smoke onto the earth. God gave them power to sting people as scorpions sting people.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **locusts** - insects that fly together in large groups. People fear them because they can eat up all the leaves in gardens and on trees. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **power like that of scorpions** - Scorpions have the ability to sting and poison other animals and people. AT: "the ability to sting people as scorpions do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **scorpions** - small insects with poisonous stingers on their tails. Their sting is extremely painful and the pain lasts a long time. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **They were told not to damage the grass on the earth or any green plant or tree** - Ordinary locusts were a terrible threat to people because when they swarm, they can eat up all the grass and leaves on plants and trees. These locusts were told not to do this. 
  * **but only the people** - The phrase "to damage" or "to harm" is understood. AT: "but only to harm the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]]) 
  * **the seal of God** - The word "seal" here refers to a tool that is used to press a mark onto a wax seal. In this case the tool would be used to put a mark on God's people. AT: "the marker of God" or "stamp of God." See how you translated "seal" in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:07:01|7:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **forehead** - the top of the face, above the eyes
