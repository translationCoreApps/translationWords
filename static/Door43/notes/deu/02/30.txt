\v 30 But Sihon, king of Heshbon, would not let us pass by him; for Yahweh your God had hardened his mind and made his heart obstinate, that he might defeat him by your might, which he has now done today.
\v 31 Yahweh said to me, 'Look, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you; begin to possess it, in order that you may inherit his land.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to remind the people of what happened in the past.

  * **your God ... your might** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so all instances of "your" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **hardened his mind and made his heart obstinate** - Both of these phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh "caused him to become very stubborn." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **to deliver up Sihon and his land before you** - "to give Sihon and his land over to you"
  * **begin to possess it, in order that you may inherit his land** - "take possession of his land, so that you may inherit it"
