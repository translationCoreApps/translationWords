\v 14 If the people \add who live in any house or town\add* do not welcome you \add to their home or town\add*, nor listen to your message, leave that house or town. And as you leave, shake off the dust from your feet. \add By doing that, you will warn them that God will punish them for rejecting your message\add*.
\v 15 Note this carefully: \add At the time when God\add* judges \add all people, he\add* will punish \add the people who lived in\add* Sodom and Gomorrah \f + \ft metonymy \f*, \add the ancient cities which God destroyed because their people were extremely wicked\add*. But in any town where the people \f + \ft metonymy \f* refused to hear your message, God will punish them very severely."

\v 14 If the people who live in any house or town do not welcome you, nor listen to your message, leave that place. As you leave, shake off the dust from your feet. By doing that, you will warn them that God will reject them as they rejected what you said.
\v 15 Note this carefully: At the time when God judges all people, he will punish the wicked people who lived in Sodom and Gomorrah. But if the people of any city reject you, God will punish them even more severely.

\v 15 Truly I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
