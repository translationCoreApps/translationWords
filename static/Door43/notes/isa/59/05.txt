<usfm>
\v 5 What you plan to do to harm people is like the eggs a poisonous snake lays, like a web that a spider catches its victims in.
\q2 Cobras will hatch from those eggs,
\q2 and insects will fall into the spider's web.
\q1
\v 6 You cannot hide the evil deeds that you have done.
\q1 You are constantly acting violently.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 5 They hatch eggs of a poisonous snake and weave a spider's web. 
\q1 Whoever eats of their eggs dies, and if an egg is crushed, it hatches into a poisonous snake.
\q1
\v 6 Their webs cannot be used for garments, nor can they cover themselves with their works. 
\q1 Their works are works of sin, and deeds of violence are in their hands.
