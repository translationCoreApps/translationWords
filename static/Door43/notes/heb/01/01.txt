\v 1 Long ago God communicated frequently to our ancestors in various ways by what the prophets said and wrote.
\v 2 But now when this final age is beginning, God has communicated to us by his own Son. God has chosen him to possess all things. By him God also created the universe.
\v 3 God's Son is the light of God's powerful brilliance. He shows exactly what God is truly like. All things that existâ€”he keeps them existing by giving powerful commands. After he had acted so that all sin should be forgiven, he rose into heaven and sat down at the highest place of honor, at the right side of God the Father, where he rules with him.

\v 1 Long ago God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in many ways.
\v 2 But in these last days, he has spoken to us through a Son, whom he appointed to be the heir of all things. It is through him that God also made the universe.
\v 3 He is the brightness of God's glory, the very character of his essence. He even holds everything together by the word of his power. After he had made cleansing for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This prologue lays the background for the whole book: the unsurpassing greatness of the Son--the Son is greater than all. The book begins with emphasizing that the Son is better than the prophets and the angels.
  * **General Information:** - Though not told at the opening, this letter was written particularly to Hebrews (Jews), who would have understood the many Old Testament references.

  * **in these last days** - "in these final days." This phrase refers to the time when Jesus began his ministry, extending until God establishes his complete rule in his creation.
  * **through a Son** - "Son" is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **to be the heir of all things** - The author speaks of the Son as if he will inherit wealth and property from his Father. AT: "to possess all things" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **It is through him that God also made the universe** - "It is through the Son that God also made all things"

AT: "The Son is just like God" or "What is true about God is true about the Son"
  * **the word of his power** - "his powerful word." Here "word" refers to a message or command. AT: "his powerful command" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **After he had made cleansing for sins** - The abstract noun "cleansing" can be expressed as a verb: "making clean." AT: "After he had finished making us clean from sins" or "After he had finished purifying us from our sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **he had made cleansing for sins** - The author speaks of forgiving sins as if it were making a person clean. AT: "he had made it possible for God to forgive our sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high** - Here "right hand" refers to a place of honor. AT: "he sat down in the place of honor next to the Majesty on high" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the Majesty on high** - Here "Majesty" refers to God. AT: "God Most High" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
