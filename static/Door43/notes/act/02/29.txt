\v 31 David knew beforehand \add what God would do\add*, so he \add was able to\add* say that God would cause the Messiah to live again \add after he died\add*. He said that God would not let the Messiah remain in the place of the dead, nor let his body decay."

\v 29 Peter continued, "My fellow Jews, I am sure that our forefather, King David, died, and that the people buried him. And the place where they buried his body is still here today.
\v 30 King David was a prophet and he knew that God promised to him that one of his descendants would become king.
\v 31 A long time ago, David knew what God would do. He said that God would cause Jesus the Messiah to live again after he died. God would not allow him to remain in a grave, and he would not let his body waste away."

\v 29 Brothers, I can speak to you confidently about the patriarch David: he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
\v 30 Therefore, he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn with an oath to him, that he would set one of the fruit of his body upon his throne.
\v 31 He foresaw this and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, 
\q 'He was neither abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see decay.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter continues his speech that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:01:15|1:16]] to the Jews that surround him and the other believers in Jerusalem.
  * **General Information:** - In verses 29 & 30, the words he," "his," and "him" refer to David. In verse 31, the first "He" refers to David and the words within the quote "He" and "his" refer to Christ.

  * **Brothers** - "Fellow Jews"
  * **he both died and was buried** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "he died and people buried him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **he would set one of the fruit of his body upon his throne** - "God would set one of David's descendants upon David's throne." AT: "God would appoint one of David's descendants to be king in David's place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **one of the fruit of his body** - Here the word "fruit" refers to what "his body" produces. AT: "one of his descendants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **He foresaw this** - "He knew this before it happened." Peter uses this language to speak of knowing something beforehand as if it were seen beforehand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **He foresaw** - In this case, God enabled David to speak about the Messiah's resurrection. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He was neither abandoned to Hades** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God did not abandon him to Hades" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **nor did his flesh see decay** - Here the word "see" means to experience something. The word "decay" refers to the decomposition of his body after death. AT: "nor did his flesh decay" or "nor did he remain dead long enough for his flesh to decay." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:act:02:27|2:27]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
