===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 This is the reason that we built that altar: We were afraid\f + \ft Or: worried \f* that some day your descendants would say that our descendants are not true Israelites. We were afraid that then they would say, 'You are not allowed to worship Yahweh, the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 No, we built this altar because we were afraid that your children might speak to our children one day in the future and ask, 'What have you to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel?"
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 No! We did it for fear that in time to come your children might say to our children, 'What have you to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The tribes of Reuben, Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh now give their answer.

  * **your children might say to our children ... God of Israel?** - This is a hypothetical accusation that the three tribes think the children of the other tribes may make sometime in the future. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **What have you to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel?** - The three tribes use this rhetorical question to emphasize the situation they are trying to avoid. This can be written as a statement. AT: "You have nothing to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
