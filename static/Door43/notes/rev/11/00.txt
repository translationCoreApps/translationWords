====== Revelation 11 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 11:15, 17-18, which are extended quotations.

== Woe ==

There are several specific "woes" mention in the book of Revelation. This chapter contains the second and third of these woes. It is possible these have some structural significance or importance to the chronology of the events of Revelation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Gentiles ==
Gentiles is used in this chapter to refer to ungodly Gentiles and not Gentile Christians. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:ungodly]]) 

== Two witnesses ==
These two witnesses serve an important function as prophets during the time of Revelation. Scholars have put forth many suggestions about the identity of these two men. It is unknown and unimportant who they are. Instead, it is their indestructible nature and their message that is more significant and undeniable. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]]) 

== Bottomless pit ==
This is a common image in the book of Revelation to describe hell. It emphasizes hell is inescapable. It is described as being down, in opposition to heaven which is considered up. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:hell]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "These two prophets tormented those who lived on the earth" ==
The two prophets are connected with a great deal of destruction, which will cause great harm to the people on the earth. This is not mean-spirited, but it is an effort to bring these people to repentance. This will not happen. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:repent]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== "The time has come for the dead to be judged" ==
People will be judged after they die. Those who reject Jesus will suffer eternal punishment, while Christian will be rewarded for the faithfulness with which they lived their lives as Christians. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:eternity]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faithful]])
