===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Because Asaph was not sure of the answer to these questions, they are probably literal questions and should be translated lierally. 

  * **covenant faithfulness** - In speaking of Yahweh's "covenant faithfulness" David is trusting that Yahweh will always love him. AT: "faithful love." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:013:005|13:5]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Had his anger shut off his compassion** - Asaph speaks of anger as if it were a person shutting a door to keep another person, compassion, from coming out, AT: "Had God stopped showing us compassion because he was angry with us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
