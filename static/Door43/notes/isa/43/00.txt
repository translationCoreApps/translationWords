====== Isaiah 43 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Exodus ==
This chapter pictures Judah's eventual return from exile in Babylon as a kind of second exodus. It was reminiscent of their exodus from Egypt. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Exile ==
This chapter prophesies about the Jews return from Babylon, but the exile has yet to happen and is still more than a hundred years in the future. These events will show that Yahweh alone is God. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
