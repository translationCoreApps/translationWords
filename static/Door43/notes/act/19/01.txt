  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul travels to Ephesus.
  * **General Information:** - The "upper country" was an area of Asia which today is part of modern-day Turkey to the north of Ephesus. Paul must have traveled by land around the top of the Aegean sea in order to come to Ephesus (also in Turkey today) which is directly east of Corinth by sea.

  * **It came about that** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **passed through** - "traveled through"
  * **receive the Holy Spirit** - This means to have the Holy Spirit come upon them.
