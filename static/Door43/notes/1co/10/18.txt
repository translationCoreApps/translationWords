\v 18 Consider \add what happens when\add* the Israelite people \add eat the food that the priests\add* sacrifice on the altar \add outside the Temple\add*. They participate in \add what the priests do at\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the altar.\f + \ft Or: Are they not participating in \add what the priests do at\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the altar? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add Similarly, if you eat food that non-believers have offered to an idol in a temple, you are participating in their worship of the idol there\add*.
\v 19 By saying that, \add I\add* do not mean that offering food to an idol makes it anything \add more than just ordinary food.\f + \ft Or: do I mean\add* that offering food to an idol makes it anything \add more than just ordinary food\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* I do not mean that an idol is anything \add more than just an idol\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Think about the people of Israel. Those who eat the sacrifices at the altar share in the altar.
\v 19 So I am saying that an idol is not something real and to eat food sacrificed to an idol is not significant. But even so, there are important issues here.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Look at the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar?
\v 19 What am I saying then? That an idol is anything? Or that food sacrificed to an idol is anything?
