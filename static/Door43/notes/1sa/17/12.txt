  * **He had eight sons** - "He" refers to Jesse.
  * **Jesse was an old man ... very old among men** - The two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **second to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah** - "Abinadab the second born, and Shammah the third born." This phrase shows birth order.
