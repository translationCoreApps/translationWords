===== translationNotes: =====

  * **will see this** - "will see that things go well for the godly person." The word "this" refers to everything good that the writer has described in the previous verses about the godly person.
  * **he will gnash with his teeth** - Gnashing one's teeth was a gesture of scorn. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:035:015|35:16]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **melt away** - The writer speaks of the wicked person's eventual death as if that person were something, such as ice, that can melt. AT: "eventually die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the desire of the wicked people will perish** - Possible meanings of "desire" are 1) the emotional desire that wicked people have. AT: "the things that wicked people want to do will never happen" or 2) it is a metonym for the things that wicked people have desired. AT: "wicked people will lose the things that they desired" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
