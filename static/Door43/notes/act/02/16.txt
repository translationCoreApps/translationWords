\v 16 Instead, what has happened to us is the miraculous thing that the prophet Joel wrote about long ago. He wrote:
\p God says,
\v 17 'During the last days, I will give my Holy Spirit to all people, and your sons and daughters will tell people my messages, and I will give visions to the young men and I will give dreams to the old men.
