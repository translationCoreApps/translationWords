\v 20 That is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah. He always faithfully did things that Yahweh his God says are right and good.
\v 21 In everything that he did for the worship in the temple, and as he obeyed God's laws and commands, he tried to find out what his God wanted, and he worked energetically. So he was successful.

\v 20 Hezekiah did this throughout all Judah. He accomplished what was good, right, and faithful before Yahweh, his God.
\v 21 In every project that he began in the service of the house of God, the law, and the commandments, to seek his God, he performed it with all his heart, and he succeeded.
