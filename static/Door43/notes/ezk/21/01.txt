===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **set your face toward Jerusalem** - This is a command to stare at Jerusalem as a symbol of punishing the people there. AT: "stare at Jerusalem" or "stare at Jerusalem so that the people there will be harmed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **set your face toward Jerusalem** - Jerusalem was far away, so Ezekiel could not see it, but staring in that direction would be a symbol of harming it. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:01|6:2]] AT: "Turn toward Jerusalem and stare" or "stare toward Jerusalem so that the people there will be harmed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **I will draw my sword from its sheath and cut off both the righteous person and the wicked person from you** - This speaks of Yahweh causing these people to die as if he actually killed them with his own sword. AT: "I am opposed to you, and it will be as though I pull my sword from its sheath to kill both the righteous and the wicked people among you" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the righteous person and the wicked person** - "righteous people and wicked people." This refers to multiple people, not just one righteous person and one wicked person.
  * **sheath** - something that holds and covers a sword when no one is using it 
  * **cut off** - This is a euphemism that means to kill. AT: "kill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
