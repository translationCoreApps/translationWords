===== translationNotes: =====


  * **He said, "Why is it that you ask my name?"** - "He said, 'Why would you ask about my name?'" This rhetorical question was meant to shock, rebuke and cause Jacob to ponder over what just happened between him and the other man he just wrestled with. AT: "Do not ask me for my name!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Peniel** - Translators may add a footnote that says: "The name Peniel means 'the face of God.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **face to face** - Being "face to face" means that two people are seeing each other in person, at a close distance.
  * **and my life is delivered** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "yet he spared my life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
