===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He raises up the poor ... from the ash heap** - These two phrases are parallel. The writer speaks of Yahweh helping and honoring people who are poor as if Yahweh caused them to stand up from sitting in dirt and ashes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **out of the dirt ... from the ash heap** - Sitting in dirt and ashes represents either poverty or despair. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **so that he may seat him with princes, with the princes of his people** - Here the second phrase clarifies that the first phrase refers to the princes of Yahweh's people.
