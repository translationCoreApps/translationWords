\v 22 Do \add they tell you\add* that they are Hebrews \add and can speak in the Hebrew language?\add* Well, I can say the same thing \add about myself\add*. Do they \add tell you that they\add* belong \add to God's people\add*, the nation of Israel? Well, I can say the same thing \add about myself\add*. \add Do they tell you that\add* they are descendants of \add our great\add* ancestor Abraham? Well, he is my ancestor, too.
\v 23 \add Do they tell you how much\add* work they have done for Christ? Now I am talking like a crazy person talks \f + \ft euphemism \f*. Well, I work for Christ much more \add than they do. I have been\add* in prison many more times \add than they have. Many times I\add* have been beaten \f + \ft Or:\add people\add* have beaten me \f* very severely \add because I believe in and obey Christ\add*. Many times I almost died \add because of serving Christ\add*.

\v 22 Are those people Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.
\v 23 Are they servants of Christ?—I speak like a man who is out of his mind! I worked harder than any of them; I have been in more prisons than they; I have had more severe beatings than they, and I have faced death more times that than they have.

\v 22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.
\v 23 Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as though I were out of my mind.) I am more. I have been in even more hard work, in far more prisons, in beatings beyond measure, in facing many dangers of death.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - As Paul continues to confirm his apostleship, he states specific things that have happened to him since he became a believer.

  * **Are they Hebrews? ... Are they Israelites? ... Are they descendants of Abraham? ... Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as though I were out of my mind.) I am more** - Paul is asking questions the Corinthians might be asking and then answering them to emphasize that he is as much a Jew as the super-apostles are. You should keep the question-and-answer form if possible. AT: "They want you to think they are important and to believe what they say because they are Hebrews and Israelites and descendants of Abraham. Well, so am I. They say they are servants of Christ—I speak as though I were out of my mind—but I am more"
  * **as though I were out of my mind** - "as though I were unable to think well"
  * **I am more** - You can make clear the understood information. AT: "I am more a servant of Christ than they are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **in even more hard work** - "I have worked harder"
  * **in far more prisons** - "I have been in prisons more often"
  * **in beatings beyond measure** - This is an idiom, and is exaggerated to emphasize how often he had been beaten. AT: "I have been beaten very many times" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **in facing many dangers of death** - "and I have almost died many times"
