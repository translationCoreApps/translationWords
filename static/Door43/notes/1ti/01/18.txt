====== 1 Timothy 01:18-20 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Timothy, you \add are like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a son \add to me\add*. So, based on\f + \ft Or: in accordance with \f* what \add someone\add* previously prophesied\f + \ft Or: told what God revealed to them \f* about you, I am instructing you \add to strongly oppose those who teach false doctrines, Or: teachings. You should oppose them like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a soldier fights strongly against\f + \ft Or: opposes \f* \add those who attack his countrymen\add*.
\v 19 Continue to believe \add the true teaching\add* and do only what you know to be right! Remember that some people have pushed aside\f + \ft Or: rejected \f* the true teaching. As a result, they no longer believe \f + \ft metaphor \f* what is true.
\v 20 Among the ones who have done that are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I put in the hands of Satan, in order that \add when Satan punishes them\add* they may learn not to teach wrong teaching.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Timothy, my child, I command you: remember what certain believers prophesied about you. Do this in order to follow those things as you work hard for the Lord.
\v 19 Trust God and keep a good conscience. Some people have not paid attention to their own consciences. So what has happened to their faith is a disaster.
\v 20 Hymenaeus and Alexander are two men like this. I have handed them over to Satan for him to attack them, so that they may learn not to insult God.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 18 I am placing this command before you, Timothy, my child. I am doing this in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, so that you might engage in the good fight.
\v 19 Do this so that you may have faith and a good conscience. Some people have rejected these and have been shipwrecked in respect to the faith.
\v 20 Such are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I gave over to Satan so that they may be taught not to blaspheme.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I am placing this command before you** - Paul speaks of his instructions as if he could physically put them in front of Timothy. AT: "I am entrusting you with this command" or "This is what I am commanding you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my child** - Paul speaks of his close relationship to Timothy as though Paul is the father and Timothy is the child. Paul thinks of Timothy as a his child because Paul taught Timothy to have faith in Jesus. AT: "who is truly like my child" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "in agreement with what other believers prophesied about you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **engage in the good fight** - Paul speaks about Timothy working for the Lord as if he were a soldier fighting a battle. AT: "continue to work hard for the Lord" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a good conscience** - "a conscience that chooses right instead wrong." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1ti:01:05|1:5]].
  * **have been shipwrecked in respect to the faith** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "they have shipwrecked their faith" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **have been shipwrecked in respect to the faith** - Paul speaks of these people's faith as if it were a ship that could be wrecked at sea. He means that they have ruined their faith and no longer believe in Jesus. You should use this or a similar metaphor if it will be understood in the project language. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Hymenaeus and Alexander** - These are names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **whom I gave over to Satan** - Paul speaks as if he physically handed these men to Satan. This probably means that Paul rejected them from the community of believers. Since they are no longer a part of the community, Satan can have power of them and harm them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they may be taught** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that God may teach them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
