===== translationNotes: =====

  * **people** - This refers to the Israelites.

  * **He put in place decrees and laws** - Establishing laws is spoken of as if Joshua physically set them in place like monuments. AT: "He established decrees and laws" or "He gave them laws and decrees to obey" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The Book of the Law of God** - This appears to be a continuation of the writings of Moses.
  * **set it up there** - "placed it there"
