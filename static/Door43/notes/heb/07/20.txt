\v 20 Furthermore, when God appointed Christ as a priest, he solemnly declared it. When God appointed former priests, he did not do this.
\v 21 But when he appointed Christ to be a priest, it was by these words that the Psalmist wrote in scripture:
\q "The Lord has solemnly declared
\q —and he will not change his mind:
\q 'You will be a priest forever!'"

\v 20 And this did not happen without the taking of an oath. On one hand, those others become priests without any oath.
\v 21 But on the other hand, this one, Jesus, became a priest with an oath sworn by the one who said to him,
\q "The Lord swore and will not change his mind:
\q 'You are a priest forever.'"
