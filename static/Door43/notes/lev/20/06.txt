===== translationNotes: =====

  * **so as to prostitute themselves with them** - This phrase compares the unfaithful people to prostitutes. AT: "by doing that, they seek advice from the spirits rather than from me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **set my face against** - This phrase "set my face against" means "to reject." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:20:03|20:3]].
