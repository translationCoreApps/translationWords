\v 4 Then they said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was seized \f + \ft Or:\add we\add* seized this woman \f* while she was having sex with a man who is not her husband.
\v 5 Moses commanded us in the laws that \add he gave us\add* that we should throw stones at such women \add and kill them\add*. So what do you say \add we should do\add*?"
\v 6 They asked this question as a trap so that they could accuse him. \add If he said that they should not kill her, they would shame him for disobeying the law of Moses. If he said that they should kill her, they could accuse him to the Roman governor\add*.
\p But Jesus bent down and wrote something on the ground with his finger.

\v 4 They said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught committing adultery with a man, someone not her husband.
\v 5 Now Moses commanded us in the law that we must execute such a woman with stones. Nevertheless, what do you say we should do?"
\v 6 They asked this question as a trap so that they could accuse him of saying something wrong. If he said that they should not kill her, they could say that he dishonored the law of Moses. However, if he said that they should kill her, he would be breaking the Roman law that reserved for the governor the power to execute people. 
\p However, Jesus bent down and wrote something on the ground with his finger.

\v 5 Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such people; what do you say about her?"
\v 6 They said this in order to trap him so that they might have something to accuse him about, but Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.
