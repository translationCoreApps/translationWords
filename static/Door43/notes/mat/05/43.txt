\v 43 "You have heard that God said to our ancestors, 'Love your fellow Israelites and hate foreigners, for they are your enemies.'
\v 44 But now listen to what I say to you: love your enemies as well as your friends, and pray for those who cause you to suffer.
\v 45 Do this in order to be like God, your Father who is in heaven. He acts kindly to all people. For example, he causes the sun to shine equally on wicked people and on good people, and he sends rain both on people who obey his law and on people who do not.

\p
\v 43 You have heard that it was said, 'You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'	
\v 44 But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
\f + \ft The best ancient copies omit \fqa "Bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you." \f*

\v 45 so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to teach about how he has come to fulfill the Old Testament law. Here he begins to speak about loving enemies.
  * **General Information:** - Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. Only "you will love ... and hate your enemy" are singular, but you may have to translate them as plurals. All other instances of "you," as well as the commands "love" and "pray," are plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **You have heard that it was said** - Jesus agrees with God and his word. But, he does not agree with the way the religious leaders had applied God's word. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Your religious leaders have told you that God said." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:33|5:33]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **neighbor** - The word "neighbor" here refers to members of the same community or people group whom one usually desires to or ought to treat kindly. It does not refer simply to people who live nearby. You may have to translate it as plural.
  * **But I say** - The "I" is emphatic. This indicates that what Jesus says is equally important to the original commands from God. Try to translate this phrase in a way that shows that emphasis. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:21|5:22]].
  * **you may be sons of your Father** - It is best to translate "sons" with the same word your language would naturally use to refer to human sons or children.
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
