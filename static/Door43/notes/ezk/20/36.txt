\v 38 I will get rid of those people among you who rebel \f + \ft doublet \f* against me. Although I will bring them out of \add Babylonia\add*, where they are now living, they will not enter Israel.

<usfm>
\v 36 As I judged your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so also I will judge youâ€”this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
\v 37 I will cause you to pass under my rod, and I will make you obey the requirements of the covenant.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the house of Israel.

  * **I will cause you to pass under my rod** - This refers to the practice of a shepherd counting and inspecting his sheep as the sheep walked under his staff. Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh will count his people whom he gathers from the nations to ensure that they are all present. AT: "I will count you carefully as a shepherd counts his sheep" or 2) Yahweh will inspect each person as they pass under his staff in order to separate the faithful from the unfaithful. AT: "I will inspect you carefully as a shepherd inspects his sheep" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
