  * **into the pool** - This was a hole in the ground that people filled with water. Sometimes they lined the pools with tiles or other stonework. See how you translated "pool" in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:05:01|5:2]].
  * **another steps down before me** - "someone else always goes down the steps into the water before me"
