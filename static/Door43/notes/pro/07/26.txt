===== translationNotes: =====

  * **She has caused many people to fall down pierced** - Being pierced by spears or arrows represents being killed. AT: "She has caused many people to fall dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Her house is on the paths to Sheol ... they go down** - Here "paths" represents the kinds of behavior that foolish people participate in. Sheol was the name for the world of the dead. 
  * **on the paths to Sheol ... down to the dark bedrooms of death** - These two phrases basically mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize that the woman's victims will be destroyed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the dark bedrooms of death** - This expression pictures the dead as sleeping in many different rooms in Sheol. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
