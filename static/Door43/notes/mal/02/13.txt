===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Malachi continues to speak to his fellow Israelites.

  * **You cover the altar of Yahweh with tears** - This stands in an exaggerated way for worshipers weeping while they pray to Yahweh for help. This statement is meant to signal disapproval of the worshipers' false worship of Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **with weeping and sighing** - The words "weeping" and "sighing" share similar meanings and intensify the idea of weeping. AT: "with great weeping" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **does not turn toward the offering** - Here turning toward a gift stands for receiving it and showing favor to the giver. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **does not turn toward the offering** - This implies that those who are weeping at Yahweh's altar have offered sacrifices to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **from your hand** - Here "hand" stands for the person giving the offering. AT: "from you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
