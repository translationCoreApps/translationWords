\v 11 Then David took hold of his clothing and he tore it apart, and all the men who were with him tore their clothes apart as well.
\v 12 They tore their clothing because they were very sad and they refused to eat anything until evening because they remembered that Saul and his son Jonathan had died, and that so many of the people of Yahweh had died, and they were sad because of the great dangers the descendants of Israel had gone through, and because so many of them died in battle.
\p
\v 13 But David asked the young man who had told him about the battle, "Where are you from?" He replied, "My father is a descendant of Amalek, but we live in Israel."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **David tore his clothes ... the men with him did the same** - David and his men tore their clothes as a sign of mourning for the death of King Saul. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel** - Both statements mean basically same thing. The word "house" is a metonym that represents the descendants of Israel. But, both "people" and "house" probably are a synecdoche representing the soldiers of Israel. AT: "for the Israelite soldiers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Yahweh** - This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. See the translationWord page about Yahweh concerning how to translate this.
  * **they had fallen by the sword** - Here "fallen" is a polite way of referring to being killed. Also, "sword" represents a battle. AT: "they had died in battle" or "enemies had killed them in battle" This here means "had been killed." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Where are you from?** - The man had already stated that he is an Amalekite in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:01:08|1:8]]. David apparently asks the man to confirm this because of the serious judgment that David was going to pronounce on the man.
