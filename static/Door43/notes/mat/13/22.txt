\v 22 \add Some people are like the soil that had the roots of\add* thorny \add weeds\add* in it. They hear God's message, but they desire to be rich, \add so they\add* worry \add only\add* about \f + \ft metonymy, personification \f* material things. As a result, they \f + \ft personification \f* forget \add God's\add* message and they do not do [IDI] the things that God wants them to do.
\v 23 But \add some people are like the\add* good soil where \add some of the seeds\add* fell. \add Just like the plants that grew in this soil\add* produced a lot of grain, \add these people\add* hear my message and understand it. \add Some of them\add* do many things [IDI] \add that please God, some do\add* even more\add things that please God, and some do\add* very many \add things that please God\add*."

\v 22 Some people hear God's message, but they desire to be rich, so they worry only about money and what they can buy with money. As a result, they forget God's message and they do not do the things that God wants them to do. These people are like the soil that had the roots of thorny weeds in it.
\v 23 But some people hear my message and understand it. Some of them do many things that please God, some do even more things that please God, and some do very many things that please God. They are like the good soil where some of the seeds fell."

\v 22 What was sown among the thorn plants, this is the person who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful. 
\v 23 What was sown on the good soil, this is the person who hears the word and understands it. He bearing fruit and making a crop, yielding one hundred times as much as was planted, some sixty, and some thirty times as much."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to explain to his disciples the parable about a person who sows seeds.

  * **He who was sown among the thorn plants** - If a literal translation makes no sense, try to translate so the reader understands that Jesus is the sower, the message is the seed, and the hearer is the ground with thorn plants. AT: "This is how it is with the seed that the sower scattered on the ground with thorn plants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the word** - Here "word" refers to a message. AT: "the message" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful** - The parable uses metaphor, which may be difficult to understand in your language. AT: "as weeds prevent good plants from growing, the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches keep this person from becoming fruitful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **cares of the world** - "the things in this world that people worry about"
  * **the deceitfulness of riches** - Jesus describes "riches" as if it were a person who could deceive someone. This means people think having more money will make them happy, but it will not. AT: "the love of money" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) 
  * **becomes unfruitful** - "becomes unproductive." This means they do not produce spiritual fruit. The person becomes concerned with things of the world and stops obeying God's message.
  * **This is he who truly produces fruit and cultivates it** - The parable uses metaphor, which may be difficult to understand in your language. AT: "These are the ones who are fruitful and productive" or "Like healthy plants that produce good fruit, these people are productive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty** - "100 ... 60 ... 30." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:07|13:8]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
