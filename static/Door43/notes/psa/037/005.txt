===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Give your ways to Yahweh** - Here "give your ways" is an idiom that means to ask Yahweh to control your life. AT: "Ask Yahweh to guide your actions in life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **act on your behalf** - This is to represent another in legal issues. Here, when one trusts in Yahweh, he will defend that person and grant justice to that person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **like the daylight ... like the day at noon** - Both of these phrases mean about the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **like the daylight** - This means "in full view of everyone." AT: "as clear to see as the light of day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **like the day at noon** - This means "as visible as the noon sun." AT: "as visible as the light at the brightest time of day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
