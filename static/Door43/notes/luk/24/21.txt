===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The two men continue responding to Jesus.

  * **who would free Israel** - The Romans ruled over the Jews. AT: "who would free the Israelites from our Roman enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Yes, and besides all this** - This introduces another reason why they believed Jesus would not free Israel. AT: "Now that does not seem possible because" 
  * **the third day** - The Jews counted any portion of a day as a day. Therefore, the day Jesus was raised was the "third day" because it followed the day of his burial and the Sabbath day. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:24:06|24:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **since all these things happened** - "since all the many actions have taken place that led up to the death of Jesus"
