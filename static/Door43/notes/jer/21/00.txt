=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 21:11-14, which is an extended quotation. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Jerusalem doomed ==

God will fight against Jerusalem and will use the nation of Babylon to fight his battle. If the Jews wanted to live, they must surrender to Babylon. Most of the Jews would have rather died than to surrender to Babylon. Usually, fighting against a Gentile nation was a sign of trust in Yahweh's power. In this instance, it was a sign of trust in Yahweh to surrender. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sign]] and [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])
