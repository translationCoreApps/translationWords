====== Jeremiah 23 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 23:5-6, 9-24, which are extended quotations. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Prophesying lies ==

The false prophets had encouraged people to continue sinning by saying everything will be alright. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]]) 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Wordplay ==

In Hebrew, the word for "message" can also mean "burden." In translations that are using footnotes, you may want to explain the word play in a footnote. In translations that are not using footnotes or which will primarily be distributed in an oral form, you may need a sentence like "What message has the Lord burdened you with now?" or "You (plural) call God's message a heavy burden on you."
