\v 12 Therefore, my fellow believers, we must \add live as the Spirit directs us\add*. What we do not have to do is to live as our self-directed nature \add guides us\add*.
\v 13 If you live the way your self-directed nature \add directs\add*, you will surely not live \add eternally\add* \f + \ft Or: will surely be eternally separated from God \f*. But if by \add the power of God's\add* Spirit you quit doing the \add sinful\add* things that your bodies \add desire\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, you will live eternally.

<usfm>
\v 12 Therefore, my fellow believers, we are obligated live as the Spirit directs us. What we are not obligated to live as our old evil nature wants us to.
\v 13 If you do what your old evil nature wants, you will surely not live forever with God. But if the Spirit stops you from doing those things, then you will live forever.

\v 12 So then, brothers, we are debtors, but not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.
\v 13 For if you live according to the flesh, you are about to die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the body's actions, you will live.
