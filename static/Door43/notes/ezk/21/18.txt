\v 18 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 19 "You human, mark \add on a map\add* two roads for the king of Babylonia to march on \add along with his army, carrying\add* their swords. When they depart from their country, they will come to a sign post where the road divides.
\v 20 \add If they continue on the one road\add*, they will attack Rabbah \add city\add*, the capital of the Ammon people-group. \add If they continue on the other road\add*, they will come to Judah and Jerusalem, a city with walls around it.

\v 18 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 19 "Son of man, draw on a map two roads for the king of Babylonia to march on with his army. When they depart from their own country, they will come to a signpost where a single road divides into those two roads.
\v 20 If they take one of those roads, they will attack the city of Rabbah, the capital of the Ammon people group. If they take the other road, they will come to Judah and Jerusalem, a city with walls around it.

\v 18 The word of Yahweh came to me again and said, 
\v 19 "Now you, son of man, assign two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to come. The two roads will start in the same land, and a signpost will mark one of them as leading to a city.
\v 20 Mark one road for the Babylonian army to come to Rabbah, the city of the Ammonites. Mark the other to lead the army to Judah and the city of Jerusalem, which is fortified.
