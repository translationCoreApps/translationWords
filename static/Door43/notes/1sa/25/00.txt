=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Foreshadowing ==
It was sinful for David to marry Abigail because he was already married. It was against the law of Moses. His sin was eventually carried on to his son Solomon. This is a type of foreshadowing, or an anticipation, of the downfall of Israel. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]])
