====== Jeremiah 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 3:1-5, 12-17, 19-25, which are extended quotations.

The prophecy revealed to Jeremiah is recorded in 2:1-3:5. Despite covering more than one chapter, this should be seen as one unit. The same is true for 3:19-4:3. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:reveal]])


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Judah told to repent ==

If Judah repents, God will bring the people back from captivity. They had not yet been taken into captivity. In this book, Israel is a reference to Judah because the northern kingdom of Israel no longer exists. The people group formed by these 10 tribes also no longer really exist. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:repent]])

== Adultery ==
Judah's apostasy is often pictured as adultery. This is a common image in Scripture. When Judah does not worship God, they are compared to an adulterous woman. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:adultery]])
