===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh is my rock** - David speaks of Yahweh as if he were a rock. The word "rock" is a picture of a safe place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my rock, my fortress** - Here the words "rock" and "fortress" share similar meanings and emphasize that Yahweh provides safety from enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **take refuge in him** - Going to Yahweh for protection is spoken of as taking refuge in him. AT: "go to him for protection" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my shield, the horn of my salvation, and my stronghold** - David speaks of Yahweh as if he were a "shield," "the horn" of his salvation, and his "stronghold." Yahweh is the one who protects him from harm. Here a similar idea is repeated three ways for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will be saved from my enemies** - "I will be rescued from my enemies"
