===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:exo:25:01|25:1]])

  * **You must make** - Yahweh is speaking to Moses, so the word "you" is singular. Yahweh probably expected Moses to tell someone else to do the actual work, but Moses would be the one responsible for seeing that the work was done correctly. "Tell a craftsman to make" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **curtains** - These were large, heavy sections of woven cloth that were used to form the covering and dividing walls of the tabernacle.
  * **scarlet wool** - wool dyed a deep red color
  * **craftsman** - a person who is skilled in making beautiful objects by hand
  * **twenty-eight cubits ... four cubits** - "28 cubits ... 4 cubits." A cubit is 46 centimeters. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Five curtains must be joined to each other ... must also be joined to each other** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Sew five curtains together to make one set, and sew the other five curtains together to make another set" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
