===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Job begins to answer Zophar's accusations.

  * **Put up with me** - "Allow me" or "Be patient with me"
  * **mock on** - "you can continue mocking me." Job is using sarcasm to imply that his friends would ignore what he would say and continue to mock him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
