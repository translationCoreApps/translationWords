<usfm>
\v 15 We were born as Jews, not as non-Jewish sinners who know nothing about God's law.
\v 16 But we now know that it is not because a person obeys the law that God gave to Moses that God makes a person right in his sight. God does that only if that person trusts in Jesus Christ. Even some of us Jews have trusted Christ Jesus. We did that so God would declare us good in his sight, because we trust Christ, and not because we try to obey the law that God gave to Moses. God has said that he will not declare anyone good in his sight just because they obey the law.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 We who are Jews by birth and not "Gentile sinners"
\v 16 know that no one is justified by the works of the law. Instead, they are justified by faith in Jesus Christ. We came to faith in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law. For by the works of the law no flesh will be justified.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul tells the believers that Jews who know the law, as well as Gentiles who do not know the law, are saved only by faith in Christ and not by keeping the law.

  * **not "Gentile sinners"** - "not those whom the Jews call Gentile sinners"
  * **We came to faith in Christ Jesus** - "We believed in Christ Jesus" 
  * **we** - This probably refers to Paul and others but not to the Galatians. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **no flesh** - The word "flesh" is a synecdoche for the whole person. AT: "no person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
