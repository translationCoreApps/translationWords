\v 5 The message that we heard from Christ and proclaim to you is this: God is \add pure in every way. He never sins. He is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a \add brilliant\add* light that has no darkness at all.
\v 6 If we claim to have a close relationship with \add God\add*, but \add we conduct our lives in an impure manner, that is like\add* living \f + \ft metaphor \f* in \add evil\add* darkness. We are lying. We are not conducting our lives according to \add God's\add* true message.
\v 7 But living\add in a pure manner\add*, as God is \add living in a pure manner\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add in every way, is like living\add* in God's light. If we do that, we have a close relationship with each other. Not only that, but \add God\add* acquits us\f + \ft Or: removes \add the guilt\add* \f* \add of\add* all our sins because \add he accepts\add* what his Son Jesus did for us \add when his\add* blood \add flowed from his body when he died. So we should conduct our lives\add* \add according to God's standard of purity\f + \ft Or: in a pure manner according to what God says is pure\add* \f*.

\v 5 The message that we heard from God and that we are proclaiming to you is this: He never sins. He is like a brilliant light that has no darkness at all.
\v 6 If we claim to have joined together with God, but if we conduct our lives in an impure manner, that is like living in evil darkness. We are lying. We are not conducting our lives according to God's true message.
\v 7 But living in a pure manner, as God is living in a pure manner in every way, is like living in God's light. If we do that, we can join together with each other, and God forgives us and accepts us because Jesus died for us.

\v 5 This is the message that we have heard from him and are announcing to you: God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all.
\v 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we are lying and are not practicing the truth.
\v 7 But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from every sin.
