===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **him will you worship** - "he is the one you must worship"
  * **To him you must cling** - To have a good relationship with Yahweh and to completely rely on him is spoken of as if the person were clinging to Yahweh. AT: "You must rely on him" or "He is the one you must rely on" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **by his name will you swear** - To swear by the name of Yahweh means to make Yahweh the basis or the power on which the oath is made. Here "name" represents Yahweh himself. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:06:13|6:13]]. AT: "you will swear and ask Yahweh to confirm it" or "when you swear you will speak his name" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **which your eyes have seen** - Here "eyes" refers to the whole person. AT: "which you yourselves have seen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
