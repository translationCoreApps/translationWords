  * **Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?** - Jesus uses a question to scold those who were trying to trap him. AT: "Do not test me, you hypocrites!" or "I know that you hypocrites are only trying to test me!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **denarius** - This was a Roman coin worth one day's wages. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]])
