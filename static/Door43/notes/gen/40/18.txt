===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This is the interpretation** - "Here is what the dream means"
  * **The three baskets are three days** - "The three baskets represent three days"
  * **will lift up your head from you** - Joseph also used the phrase "will lift up your head" when he spoke to the cupbearer in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:40:12|40:13]]. Here it has a different meaning. Possible meanings are 1) "will lift up your head to put a rope around your neck" or 2) "will lift up your head to cut it off."
  * **flesh** - Here "flesh" literally means the soft tissue on a person's body.
