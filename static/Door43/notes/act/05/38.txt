\v 38 So now I say \add this\add* to you: Do not harm these men! Release them! I say this because if \add this is just something\add* that humans have planned, they will not be able to do it. They will fail, \add like Theudas and Judas did\add*!
\v 39 But, if God \add has commanded them to do it\add*, you will not be able to prevent them \add from doing it, because\add* you will find out that you are opposing God!" The other members of the Council accepted what Gamaliel said.

\v 38 So now I say this to you: Do not harm these men! Release them! I say this because if the things that are happening now are just something that humans have planned, someone will stop them. They will fail.
\v 39 But if God has commanded them to do these things, you will not be able to stop them, because you will find out that you are working against God!" The other members of the council accepted what Gamaliel said.

\v 38 Now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or work is of men, it will be overthrown.
\v 39 But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them; you may even find that you are fighting against God." So they were persuaded.
