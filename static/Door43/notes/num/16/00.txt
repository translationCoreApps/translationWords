== Rebellion ==

A Levite and some of the Reubenites said they were as better than Moses and Aaron and could do the temple work. So Moses told them to come to the sacred tent and burn incense to Yahweh. God then burned them up and made the earth open up and the leaders and their families fell in and the earth closed again. This showed that only the Levites, whom Yahweh appointed, could be priests. Also, it taught the people that to rebel against Yahweh's anointed was to rebel against Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:appoint]], [[:en:obe:kt:priest]] and [[:en:obe:kt:anoint]])
