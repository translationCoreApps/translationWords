====== Joshua 23 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Joshua's final words to Israel (Joshua 23-24) ==

"Do not marry with the heathen people but drive them out." == Drive them out ==
The Israelites were to completely drive out the Canaanites. If they did not drive them out completely, the Canaanites would cause the Israelites to worship other gods. It was sinful to allow the Canaanites to remain in the land because if the Israelites married the Canaanites, the Canaanites would cause them to worship other gods.  (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])
