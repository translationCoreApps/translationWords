===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins his ministry with his baptism.

  * **Now it came about** - This phrase marks the beginning of a new event in the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])
  * **when all the people were baptized** - "while John had baptized all the people." The phrase "all the people" refers to the people present with John. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **baptized** - "Jesus was baptized by John." Some audiences might be confused that John was baptizing when Herod put him in prison in the previous verse. If so, it might be helpful to tell them that this account happened before John was arrested. The UDB does this by putting "But before John was put in prison" at the beginning of this verse. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_events]])
  * **Jesus also was baptized** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "John baptized Jesus, too" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the heavens opened** - "the sky opened" or "the sky became open." This is more than a simple clearing of clouds, but it's not clear what it means. It possibly means that a hole appeared in the sky.
  * **the Holy Spirit in bodily form came down on him** - "the Holy Spirit came down onto Jesus"
  * **like a dove** - "in physical form the Holy Spirit appeared like a dove"
  * **You are my Son, whom I love** - God the Father speaks to his Son ("whom I love"), Jesus is God the Son, while God the Spirit descends upon Jesus. The persons of God love one another and work together as Father, Son, and Spirit.
  * **my Son, whom I love** - This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
