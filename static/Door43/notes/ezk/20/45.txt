\v 45 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 46 "Son of man, set your face toward the southern lands, and speak against the south; prophesy against the forest of the Negev.
\v 47 Say to the forest of the Negev, 'Hear the declaration of Yahweh! The Lord Yahweh says this: See, I will set a fire among you. It will devour every fresh tree and every dried tree among you. The fiery flame will not be quenched; every face from the south to the north will be burned.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **set your face toward the southern lands** - This is a command to stare at the southern lands as a symbol of punishing the people there. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:01|4:3]]. AT: "Stare at the southern lands" or "Stare at the southern lands so that they will be harmed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **set your face** - Here "face" is a metonym for attention or gaze, and "set your face" represents staring. AT: "stare" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The fiery flame will not be quenched** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The fiery flame will not go out" or "No one will be able to quench the fiery flame" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

By mentioning the opposite directions, Yahweh refers to everyone who lives in the north, in the south, and everywhere in between. AT: "every person who lives in that area" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
