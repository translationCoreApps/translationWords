====== Romans 05:12-13 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 \add What you can learn from what I have written so far is as follows\add*: All people are sinful \f + \ft personification \f*, and that is the result of \add Adam, the first\add* man whom \add God created, sinning long ago\add*. Adam died \f + \ft personification \f* because he sinned. So, all people \add who have lived since then\add* die, because \add it is as though\add* all people sinned \add when Adam sinned\add*.
\v 13 \add People in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the world sinned before \add God gave his\add* laws \add to Moses\add*. But people are not considered \add by God\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* does not consider people \f* to be guilty for their sins if there is no law \add stating that what they did was sinful\add*.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 All people are sinful because Adam, the first man whom God created, sinned long ago. Because he sinned, he eventually died. So all people who have lived since then became sinners, and they all die.
\v 13 People in the world sinned before God gave his law to Moses but there was no way to recognize sin against that law.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 12 So then, as through one man sin entered into the world, in this way death entered through sin. And death spread to all people, because all sinned.
\v 13 For until the law, sin was in the world, but there is no accounting for sin when there is no law.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul explains why death happened even before God gave the law to Moses.

  * **through one man sin entered ... death entered through sin** - Paul describes sin as a dangerous thing that came into the world through the actions of "one man," Adam. This sin then became an opening through which death, pictured here as another dangerous thing, also came into the world. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **For until the law, sin was in the world** - This means that the people sinned before God gave the law. AT: "People in the world sinned before God gave his law to Moses" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **but there is no accounting for sin when there is no law** - This means that God did not charge the people with sinning before he gave the law. AT: "but God recorded no sin against the law before he gave the law" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
