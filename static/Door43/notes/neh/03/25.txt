===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Palal ... repaired ... Parosh repaired ... servants ... repaired ... repaired another section** - These phrases refer to repairing the wall. AT: "Palal ... repaired the wall ... Parosh repaired the wall ... servants ... repaired the wall ... repaired another section of the wall"
  * **Palal ... Uzai ... Pedaiah ... Parosh** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **the tower that extends upward** - "the tower that rises up"
  * **upper house of the king** - "higher palace of the leader of Israel"
  * **the court of the guard** - This is the place where the guards stayed. 
  * **After him** - "Next to him"
  * **Ophel** - This is the name of a place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **opposite the Water Gate** - "in front of the Water Gate"
  * **the projecting tower ... the great projecting tower** - "the tall tower ... the tall tower." The phrase "the projecting tower" means a tall tower that juts out from the wall. It is likely that both of these phrases refer to the same tower. 
  * **the Tekoites** - These are people from the town of Tekoa. Translate this the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:neh:03:03|3:5]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
