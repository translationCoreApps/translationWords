\v 19 Later, some of the disciples approached Jesus when he was by himself and asked him, "Why were we not able to drive out the demon?"
\v 20-21 He answered them, "It is because you did not believe very much in God's power. Think about this: Mustard seeds are very small, but they grow and produce large plants. Similarly, if you believe even a little bit that God will do what you ask him to, you will be able to do anything! You could even say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there!' and it would go where you told it to go."

\v 19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not cast it out?"
\v 20 Jesus said to them, "Because of your small faith. For I truly say to you, if you have faith even as small as a grain of mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you. 
\v 21 \f + \ft The best ancient copies omit v. 21. \fqa But this kind of demon does not go out except with prayer and fasting."\f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **we** - Here "we" refers to the speakers but not the hearers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **Why could we not cast it out?** - "Why could we not make the demon come out of the boy?"
  * **For I truly say to you** - "I tell you the truth." This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **if you have faith even as small as a grain of mustard seed** - Jesus compares the size of a mustard seed to the amount of faith needed to do a miracle. A mustard seed is very small, but it grows into a large plant. Jesus means it only takes a small amount of faith to do a great miracle. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **nothing will be impossible for you** - This can be stated in a positive form. AT: "you will be able to do anything" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
