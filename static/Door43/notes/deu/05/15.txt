===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) 

  * **You will call to mind** - This is an idiom. AT: "You must remember" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm** - Here "a mighty hand" and "an outstretched arm" are metaphors for Yahweh's power. Translate this as it is in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:04:34|4:34]]. AT: "by showing his mighty power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
