\v 9 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls of wine—the wine that caused the seven last ways of suffering—came and said to me, "Come with me and I will show you the people who have permanently united with the Lamb as a woman marries a man!"
\p
\v 10 Then God's Spirit took control of me, and the angel took me to the top of a very high mountain. He showed me God's holy city, the new Jerusalem, which was coming down out of heaven from God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the bride, the wife of the Lamb** - The angel speaks of Jerusalem as if it were a woman who is about to marry her groom, the Lamb. Jerusalem is metonymy for those who believers who will inhabit it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the Lamb** - This is a young male sheep. Here is it used symbolically to refer to Christ. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:05:06|5:6]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **carried me away in the Spirit** - The setting changes as John is taken to a high mountain where he can see the city of Jerusalem. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:17:03|17:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
