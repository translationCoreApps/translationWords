===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to close up the sky so that no rain will fall** - John speaks of the sky as if it had a door that can be opened to let rain fall or closed to stop the rain. AT: "to keep rain from falling from the sky"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to strike the earth with every kind of plague** - John speaks of the plagues as if they were a stick that someone could hit the earth with. AT: "to cause all kinds of trouble to occur on earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **bottomless pit** - This is an extremely deep narrow hole. Possible meanings are 1) the pit has no bottom; it continues to go down further forever or 2) the pit is so deep that it is as if it had no bottom. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:09:01|9:1]].
