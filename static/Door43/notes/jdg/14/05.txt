\v 5 Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and his mother, and they came to the vineyards of Timnah. And, look, there one of the young lions came up and was roaring at him. 
\v 6 Yahweh's Spirit suddenly came on him, and he tore the lion apart as easily as he would have torn apart a small goat, and he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Samson went down to Timnah** - The phrase "went down" is used here because Timnah is higher in elevation than where his father's house was. Timah was a city in the Sorek Valley. Translate the name of this city the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:14:01|14:1]].
  * **And, look, there one of the young lions came up** - Here the word "look" is used to draw the readers attention to a surprising event that happens in the story. The phrase "came up" means that the lion came near him. AT: "Suddenly, a young lion came near him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **was roaring** - "threatened him." This is the kind of noise that a lion makes when it threatens to attack something.
  * **Yahweh's Spirit suddenly came on him** - The phrase "came on" means that Yahweh's Spirit influenced Samson. In this case, he made him very strong. AT: "Yahweh's Spirit made him very strong" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **tore ... apart** - tore into two pieces
  * **had nothing in his hand** - Here it states that he had nothing in his hand to emphasize that he was not holding a weapon. AT: "did not have a weapon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
