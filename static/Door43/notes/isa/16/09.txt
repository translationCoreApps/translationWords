\v 9 Indeed I will weep along with Jazer for the vineyard of Sibmah.
\q1 I will water you with my tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh.
\q1 For on your fields of summer fruits and harvest I have ended the shouts of joy.
\q1
\v 10 Gladness and joy are taken away from the fruit tree groves; and there is no singing, or shouts in the vineyards.
