===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus has just been talking to the people and his disciples about following him. Six days later, Jesus goes with three of his disciples up a mountain where his appearance changes, so he looks as he will one day in the kingdom of God. 

  * **And he said to them** - "And Jesus said to his disciples"
  * **the kingdom of God come with power** - This is stated figuratively. "The kingdom coming" refers to God showing himself as king. This is stated figuratively but may be written more clearly. AT: "God show himself with great power as king" (UDB)
  * **alone by themselves** - The author uses the reflexive pronoun "themselves" here to emphasize that they were alone and that only Jesus, Peter, James, and John went up the mountain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
  * **he was transfigured** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "he appeared very different" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **before them** - "in front of them"
  * **radiantly brilliant** - "shining" or "glowing." Jesus' garments were so white they were emitting or putting out light.
  * **extremely** - "very, very"
  * **whiter than any bleacher on earth could bleach them** - Bleaching describes the process of making natural white wool even whiter by using chemicals like bleach or ammonia. AT: "whiter than any person on earth could whiten them"
