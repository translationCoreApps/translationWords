===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Yahweh \add also says\add*, "What you have said has caused me to become disgusted."
\p You reply, "What have we said that caused him to become disgusted?"
\p The answer is that you have caused him to become disgusted by saying that Yahweh is pleased with all those who do what is evil. You have caused him to become disgusted by constantly asking, "Why does God not act justly\f + \ft Or: fairly \f*?"
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 You have made Yahweh lose his paitence with you by saying all those disgusting things. But you dare to ask, "How have we made him impatient?"
\p The answer is that you have said that Yahweh is pleased with all those who do what is evil, that he actually views them as good. And you have also made him impatient by always saying, "Why does God not act justly toward us?"
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 17 You have wearied Yahweh with your words. But you say, "How have we wearied him?" By saying, "Everyone who does evil is good in the eyes of Yahweh, and he delights in them," or "Where is the God of justice?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You have wearied Yahweh** - Yahweh is spoken of as if human behavior could make him tired, but God cannot grow weary in a physical or emotional sense. This statement probably means that Yahweh has become offended or exasperated. AT: "You have offended Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **How have we wearied him?** - This question is meant to deny that the people have done any wrong. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "We have certainly not wearied him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **By saying** - The complete idea here is, "You have wearied him by saying." This is the prophet's answer to the rhetorical question. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **in the eyes of Yahweh** - Here "the eyes of Yahweh" stands for "the opinion of Yahweh."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Where is the God of justice?** - The priests ask this question in order to claim either that Yahweh does not care whether people do evil or not, or that he never punishes evildoers. AT: "God certainly does not punish evil people!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the God of justice** - the God who punishes evildoers justly
