===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in the middle of everyone** - "in the middle of this crowd"
  * **Is it lawful ... kill?** - Because the author notes that the people were silent, Jesus may have asked this question to challenge them. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You should know that it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day and not to do harm, to save a life and not to kill!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to save a life, or to kill** - It may be helpful to repeat "is it lawful," as that is the question Jesus is asking again in another way. AT: "is it lawful to save a life or to kill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **a life** - This refers to physical life and is a metonym for a person. AT: "someone from dying" or "someone's life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to kill** - Here this refers to not helping someone who is in danger of dying. AT: "to allow someone to die" or "to allow a life to be lost" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
