===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **When you pass through the waters ... the flames will not destroy you** - Yahweh speaks of suffering and difficult experiences as if they are deep waters and fires through which the people walk. The words "waters" and "flames" form a merism and emphasize any difficult circumstance. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they will not overwhelm you** - These two statements mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the people will experience no harm because Yahweh is with them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I have given Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you** - These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that Yahweh will allow Israel's enemy to conquer these nations instead of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Seba** - This is the name of a nation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
