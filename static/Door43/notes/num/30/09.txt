\v 10 If a woman made a vow in her husband's house or obligates herself by taking an oath,
\v 11 and her husband hears of it, but he says nothing to her and he does oppose her, then all her vows must stand and the obligations she made must remain in force.

  * **by which she has bound herself** - Here Moses speaks of how a woman has committed herself to fulfilling a promise as if her promise were a physical object that she had bound to her body. AT: "which she has committed herself to fulfill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will remain in force against her** - This is an idiom. It means that her vows will remain in effect and she will be required to fulfill them.
