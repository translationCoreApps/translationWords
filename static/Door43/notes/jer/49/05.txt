\q
\v 5 See, I am about to bring terror on you—this is the declaration of Yahweh, the Lord of hosts—
\q this terror will come from all those who surround you. Each one of you will be scattered before it.
\q There will be no one to gather those running away.
\q
\v 6 But after this I will restore the fortunes of the people of Ammon—this is Yahweh's declaration."
