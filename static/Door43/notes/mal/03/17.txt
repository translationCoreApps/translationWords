====== Malachi 03:17-18 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says this \add about those people\add*: "They will be my people. On the day that I judge people, they will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a special treasure to me. I will be kind to them, like \f + \ft simile \f* fathers are kind to their sons who obey them.
\v 18 When that happens, you will again see that \add the manner in which I treat\add* righteous people is different from \add the manner in which I treat\add* wicked people. You will see that the manner in which I act toward those who serve me is different from the manner in which I act toward those who do not."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says this about those people:
\pi "They will be my people. On the day that I punish the wicked people among you, I will not punish them. I will be just like a father who does not punish his son who obeys him.
\v 18 When that happens, you will again see that the manner in which I treat righteous people is different from the manner in which I treat wicked people. You will see that the manner in which I act toward those who worship me is different from the manner in which I act toward those who do not."
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 "They will be mine," says Yahweh of hosts, "my own treasured possession, on the day that I act. I will
pity them, as a man pities his own son who serves him.
\v 18 Then once again you will distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between one who worships God and one who does not worship
him.
