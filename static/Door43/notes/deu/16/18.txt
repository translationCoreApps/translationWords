\v 18 You must make judges and officers within all your city gates that Yahweh your God is giving you; they will be taken from each of your tribes, and they must judge the people with righteous judgment.
\v 19 You must not take justice away by force; you must not show partiality nor take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous.
\v 20 You must follow after justice, after justice alone, so that you may live and inherit the land that Yahweh your God is giving you.
