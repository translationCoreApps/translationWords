\v 13 That is why I use parables when I speak to people, because although they see \add what I do\add*, they do not perceive \add what it means\add*, and although they hear \add what I say\add*, they do not really understand \add what it means\add*.
\v 14 What these people do completely fulfills what \add God told\add* the prophet Isaiah \add to say long ago to the people who did not\add* try to understand what he said, \p You will hear \add what I say\add*, but you will not understand it. You will keep seeing \add what I do\add*, but you will not understand \add what it means\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*. \p

\v 13 That is why I use parables when I speak to people, because although they see what I do, they do not understand what it means, and although they hear what I say, they do not really learn what it means.
\v 14 What these people do completely fulfills what God told the prophet Isaiah to say long ago,
\q 
\p You will hear what I say, but you will not understand it.
\q You will see what I do, but you will not learn what it means.

\v 13 So I talk to them in parables, because although they see, they do not really see. And although they hear, they do not really hear, neither do they understand.
\v 14 To them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, that which says, 
\q 'While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand;
\q while seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to explain to his disciples why he teaches in parables.
  * **General Information:** - In verse 14, Jesus quotes the prophet Isaiah to show that the people's failure to understand Jesus' teaching is a fulfillment of prophecy.

  * **to them ... they** - All occurrences of "them" and "they" refer to the people in the crowd.
  * **because although they see, they do not really see. And although they hear, they do not really hear** - Jesus uses this parallelism to tell and emphasize to the disciples that the crowd refuses to understand God's truth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **although they see, they do not really see** - The second use of "see" here means understand. It can be made explicit what they see. AT: "though they see the things I do, they do not understand them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **although they hear, they do not really hear, neither do they understand** - It can be made explicit what the people hear. AT: "though they hear what I say, they do not understand what I truly mean" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **To them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, that which says** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "They are fulfilling what God said long ago through the prophet Isaiah"
  * **While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand; while seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive** - This begins a quote from the prophet Isaiah about the unbelieving people of Isaiah's day. Jesus is using this quote to describe the very crowd that was listening to him. These statements are again parallel and emphasize that the people refuse to understand God's truth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand** - "You will hear things, but you will not understand them." You can make explicit what the people will hear. AT: "You will hear what God says through the prophets, but you will not understand its true meaning" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **while seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive** - You can make explicit what the people will see. AT: "you will see what God does through the prophets, but you will not understand it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
