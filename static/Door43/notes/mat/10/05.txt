  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here Jesus begins to give instructions to his disciples about what they should do and expect when they go to preach.

  * **sent out** - Jesus sent them out for a particular purpose.
  * **He instructed them** - "He told them what they needed to do" or "He commanded them"
