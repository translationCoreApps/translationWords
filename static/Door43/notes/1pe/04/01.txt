====== 1 Peter 04:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Therefore, because Christ suffered in his body, you also must think the way that he did  \add when he was willing to suffer\add*, because those who suffer in their bodies  \add because of belonging to Jesus\add* have stopped sinning  \add the way they used to sin\add*.
\v 2 As a result, during their remaining time here on earth, they do not do the things that sinful people desire to do, but instead they do the things that God wants them to do.

\v 1 Therefore, because Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same intention. For whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin.
\v 2 As a result, such a person, for the rest of his time in the flesh, no longer lives for men's desires, but for God's will.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter continues to teach the believers about Christian living. He begins by giving a conclusion to his thoughts from the previous chapter about Christ's sufferings.

  * **in the flesh** - "in his body"
  * **arm yourselves with the same intention** - The phrase "arm yourselves" makes readers think of soldiers who get their weapons ready for battle. It also pictures "the same intention" as a weapon or perhaps as a piece of armor. Here this metaphor means that believers should be determined in their mind to suffer as Jesus did. AT: "prepare yourselves with the same thoughts that Christ had" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **suffered in the flesh** - Here "flesh" means the time of our life on earth. AT: "suffered while here on earth"
  * **has ceased from sin** - 
  * **for men's desire** - For the things that sinful humanity normally desires
