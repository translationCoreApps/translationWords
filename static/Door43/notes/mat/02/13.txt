\v 13 After the men who studied the stars left Bethlehem, an angel from the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. He said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee into the country of Egypt. Stay there until I tell you that you should leave, because King Herod is about to send soldiers to look for the child so that they can kill him."
\v 14 So Joseph got up that same night; he took the child and his mother, and they fled into Egypt.
\v 15 They stayed there until King Herod died, and then they left Egypt again. In this way, what God had told the prophet Hosea to write came true,
\q "I have called my son to come out of Egypt."

\v 13 After they had departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the young child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Remain there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
\v 14 That night Joseph rose and took the young child and his mother and departed into Egypt.
\v 15 He remained there until the death of Herod. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet, "Out of Egypt I have called my son."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verse 15, the writer quotes the prophet Hosea to show that the Christ would spend time in Egypt.

  * **they had departed** - "the learned men had departed"
  * **appeared to Joseph in a dream** - "came to Joseph while he was dreaming"
  * **Get up, take ... flee ... Remain ... you** - God is speaking to Joseph, so these should all be singular forms. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **until I tell you** - The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "until I tell you it is safe to come back" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I tell you** - Here "I" refers to God. The angel is speaking for God.
  * **He remained** - It is implied that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus remained in Egypt. AT: "They remained" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **until the death of Herod** - Herod does not die until [[:en:bible:notes:mat:02:19|2:19]]. This statement describes the length of their stay in Egypt, and it does not say that Herod died at this time.
  * **Out of Egypt I have called my son** - "I have called my son out of Egypt"
  * **my son** - In Hosea this refers to the people of Israel. Matthew quoted it to say that this was true of God's Son, Jesus. Translate it using a word for son that could refer to the only son or the first son.
