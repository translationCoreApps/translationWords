===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The first** - "The first servant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **came before him** - "came before the nobleman"
  * **your mina has made ten minas more** - It is implied that the servant was the one who caused the profit. AT: "I used your mina to make a profit of ten more minas" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **mina** - A mina is 600 grams. Each mina was worth about what someone would be paid in four months. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:19:13|19:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]])
  * **Well done** - "You have done well." Your language may have a phrase that an employer would use to show approval, such as "Good job."
  * **very little** - This refers to the one mina, which the nobleman apparently did not consider to be a lot of money.
