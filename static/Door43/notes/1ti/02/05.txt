\v 5 The truth is this, that there is one God, and there is only one person who can make us acceptable to him. Christ Jesus, the man, is this one person.
\v 6 Of his own free will he died in order set all people free. God made this happen at the time he chose. It shows that he wants to save everyone.
\v 7 To declare this truth, God made me a messenger and an apostle. I speak the truth; I am not lying. I teach the Gentiles the things that they should truly believe.

<usfm>
\v 5 For there is one God, and there is one mediator for God and man, the man Christ Jesus.
\v 6 He gave himself as a ransom for all, as the testimony at the right time.
\v 7 For this purpose, I, myself, was made a herald and an apostle. I am telling the truth. I am not lying. I am a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
