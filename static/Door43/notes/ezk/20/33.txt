\v 33 As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—I will certainly reign over you with a mighty hand, a raised arm, and fury that will be poured out on you.
\v 34 I will bring you out from the other peoples and will gather you out of the countries among whom you have been scattered. I will do this with a mighty hand and with fury poured out.
\v 35 Then I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will judge you face to face.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the house of Israel.

  * **As I live** - "As surely as I am alive." Yahweh uses this expression to show that what he says next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **with a mighty hand, a raised arm** - The words "hand" and "arm" both represent power. AT: "with very great power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **fury that will be poured out on you** - Yahweh speaks of expressing his fury as if the fury were a liquid that he pours on on the people. This can be stated in active form. AT: "fury that I will pour out on you" or "I will express my fury towards you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **among whom you have been scattered** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "among whom I have scattered you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
