\v 26 So Joshua saved the lives of the people of Gibeon; he did not permit the army of Israel to harm them.
\v 27 Instead, he forced them to become the Israelites' slaves. They cut wood and carried water for Israel. They also brought the wood and water that was needed for the sacred altar of Yahweh. And the people of Gibeon are still doing that to this present time.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 So Joshua did this for them: he removed them out of the control of the people of Israel, and the Israelites did not kill them.
\v 27 That day Joshua made the Gibeonites cutters of wood and drawers of water for the community, and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day, in the place that Yahweh chooses.
