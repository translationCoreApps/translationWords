  * **carried our sins in his body to the tree** - Here "carried our sins" means that he suffered the punishment for sins. AT: "suffered the punishment for our sins in his body on the tree" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the tree** - This is a reference to the cross on which Jesus died, which was made of wood. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **you had been wandering away like lost sheep** - Peter speaks about his readers before they believed in Christ as if they had been similar to lost sheep wandering around aimlessly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
