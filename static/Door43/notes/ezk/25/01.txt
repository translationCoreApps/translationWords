===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **set your face against the people of Ammon** - This is a command to stare at the people of Ammon as a symbol of punishing them. AT: "stare at the people of Ammon" or "stare at the people of Ammon so that they will be harmed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **set your face against the people of Ammon** - Ammon was far away, so Ezekiel could not see the people there, but staring in that direction would be a symbol of harming the people. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:01|6:2]]. AT: "Turn toward the people of Ammon and stare" or "stare toward Ammon so that the people there will be harmed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **the people of Ammon** - "the descendants of Ammon" or "those who live in the land of Ammon"
  * **and prophesy against them** - "and prophesy about the bad things that will happen to them." This means to prophesy about the horrible things that will happen to the people of Ammon. See how you translated a similar phrase in in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:06|4:7]].
