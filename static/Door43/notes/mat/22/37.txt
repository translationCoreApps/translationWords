===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus quotes a verse from Deuteronomy as the greatest commandment.

  * **with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind** - All three of these phrases mean basically the same thing. They mean a person must love God with all of their inner being and with complete devotion. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the great and first commandment** - Here "great" and "first" mean the same thing. They emphasize that this is the most important commandment. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
