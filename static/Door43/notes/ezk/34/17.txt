====== Ezekiel 34:17-19 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 And as for you who are like \f + \ft metaphor \f* my sheep, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: 'I will judge between each of you; and I will separate between \add those that are peaceful like\add* sheep and \add those that are always trying to dominate others like\add* goats.
\v 18 It is bad that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* some of you keep the best pastures for yourselves. It is even worse that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* you trample the good grass with your feet. It is bad that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* you yourselves drink the clear water. It is worse that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* with your feet you cause the other water to become muddy.
\v 19 \add It is as though\add* you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* are forcing my flock to eat the grass that you have trampled and to drink the water that you have caused to become muddy!

\v 17 And as for you, my people, my sheep, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: 'I will judge between each of you; I will separate those who are peaceful from those who are cruel and powerful.
\v 18 You leaders, you who are like strong sheep who do evil to the others: it is bad that you keep the best pastures for yourselves. It is even worse that you trample the good grass with your feet. It is bad that you yourselves drink the clear water. It is even worse that with your feet you cause the rest of the water to become muddy.
\v 19 You are forcing my flock to eat the grass that you have trampled and to drink the water that you have caused to become muddy!

\v 17 And you, my flock—this is what the Lord Yahweh says—behold, I will be a judge between sheep and sheep and between rams and male goats.
\v 18 Is it not enough to feed on the good pasture, that you must trample down with your feed what is left of the pasture; and to drink from clear waters, that you must muddy the rivers with your feet?
\v 19 And must my sheep eat what you have trampled with your feet, and drink what you have muddied with your feet?

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to giving Ezekiel his message. Now it is to the people of Israel.

  * **behold** - The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. Alternate translation: "indeed"
  * **I will be a judge between sheep** - "I will judge between the sheep, rams, and goats"
  * **rams and male goats** - The male sheep and goats are usually the strongest in the flock and can get whatever they want from the other animals in the flock.
  * **Is it not enough ... feet** - This is the beginning of a question that God uses to scold the stronger ones because they are unkind to weaker ones. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
