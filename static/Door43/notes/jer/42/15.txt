\v 15 then listen to what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, says: 'If you are determined to go to Egypt, and you go and live there,
\v 16 you will experience those wars and famines that you are afraid of, and you will all die there.
\v 17 That is what will happen to all you who are determined to go to Egypt and live there. \add Some of\add* you will be killed by the swords \add of your enemies\add*, and others of you will die from famines and from diseases. None of you will escape the disasters that I will bring on you.'

\v 15 Listen now! you people who are left in Judah! Listen to what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, the God whom Israel worships, says to you: 'If you are determined to go to Egypt, and if you go and live there,
\v 16 you will experience those wars and famines that you are afraid of, and you will all die there.
\v 17 That is what will happen to all you who are determined to go to Egypt and live there. Some of you will be killed by the swords of your enemies, and others of you will die from famines and from diseases. None of you will escape the disasters that I will bring on you.'

\v 15 Now listen to this word of Yahweh, you remnant of Judah. Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, 'If you actually set out to go to Egypt, to go and live there,
\v 16 then the sword that you fear will overtake you there in the land of Egypt. The famine that you are worrying about will pursue you to Egypt, and you will die there.
\v 17 So it will happen that all the men who set out to go to Egypt to live there will die by sword, famine, or plague. There will be no survivor of them, no one to escape the disaster that I will bring on them.
