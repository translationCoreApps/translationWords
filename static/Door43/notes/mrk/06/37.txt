  * **But he answered and said to them** - "But Jesus answered and said his disciples"
  * **Can we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?** - The disciples ask this question to say that there is no way they could afford to buy enough food for this crowd. AT: "We could not buy enough bread to feed this crowd, even if we had two hundred denarii!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **two hundred denarii** - "200 denarii." A denarius is a Roman silver coin worth one day's wages. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
