\v 15 The things that I do, I often do not understand. That is, sometimes it is the good things that I want to do that I do not do. And sometimes it is the evil things that I detest that I do.
\v 16 Since I do the evil things that I do not want to do, I agree that the law of God directs me in the right way.

\v 15 For what I do, I do not really understand. For what I want to do, I do not do, and what I hate, I do.
\v 16 But if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law that the law is good.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul talks about the struggle inside his inner man between his flesh and the law of Godâ€”between sin and good.

  * **For what I do, I do not really understand** - Here Paul exaggerates to add emphasis. AT: "I am not sure why I do some of the things that I do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **For** - "because"
  * **what I want to do, I do not do** - Paul exaggerates again to add emphasis. AT: "I do not always do what I want to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]) 
  * **what I hate, I do** - Paul again exaggerates to add emphasis. AT: "the things that I know are not good are the things that I sometimes do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **But** - "However"
  * **I agree with the law** - "I know God's law is good"
