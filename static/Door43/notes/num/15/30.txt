===== translationNotes: =====

  * **That person must be cut off from among his people** - The metaphor "cut off" has at least three possible meanings. They can be expressed in active form: 1) "his people must send him away" or 2) "I will no longer consider him to be one of the people of Israel" or 3) "his people must kill him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **has broken my commandment** - Not obeying a commandment is spoken of as breaking it. AT: "has disobeyed my commandment" or "has not obeyed what I commanded" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **His sin will be on him** - Here "sin" represents either 1) punishment for that sin or 2) guilt of that sin. Sin being on him is a metaphor for either 1) being punished or 2) being guilty. AT: 1) "I will punish him because of his sin" or 2) "I will consider him guilty"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
