== Samuel chooses Saul to be their king ==

When the donkeys of Saul's father strayed away, Saul went looking for them. When he could not find them, he asked Samuel to ask God where they were. Samuel said the donkeys had been found and then invited Saul as the guest of honor to a feast and gave him a place to sleep the night. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical questions ==

Saul uses two rhetorical questions to convince Samuel he is not important: "Am not I a Benjamite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel? Is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
