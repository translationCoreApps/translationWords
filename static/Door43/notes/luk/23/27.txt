===== translationNotes: =====

  * **A great crowd** - "A large crowd"
  * **great crowd of the people, and of women** - The woman were part of the large crowd, and not a separate crowd.
  * **mourned for him** - "mourned for Jesus"
  * **were following him** - This does not mean that they were Jesus' disciples. It simply means they were walking along behind him.
  * **turning to them** - This indicates that Jesus turned to face the women and address them directly.
  * **Daughters of Jerusalem** - The "daughter" of a city means the women of the city. This was not rude. It was a normal form of address to a group of women from one location. AT: "You women who are from Jerusalem"
  * **do not weep for me, but** - "do not cry about my situation." Jesus did not mean that they should stop weeping for him. He is using hyperbole to say that they had even more reason to weep for their own situation. AT: "you are weeping for me, but even worse things are going to happen to you, so" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **but weep for yourselves and for your children** - "instead cry about what is going to happen to you and to your children" (UDB)
