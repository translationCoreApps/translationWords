<usfm>
\v 16 One who was like the sons of man touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and spoke to him who stood before me: "My master, I am in agony because of the vision; I have no strength left.
\v 17 I am your servant. How can I talk with my master? For I now have no strength, and there is no breath left in me."
