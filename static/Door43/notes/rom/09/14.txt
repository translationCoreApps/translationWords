\v 15 God told Moses, "I will pity and help anyone whom I choose \f + \ft doublet \f*!"
\v 16 So \add God chooses people\add*, not because they want \add God to choose them\add* or because they try hard \add to do things so that he\add* will \add accept them\add*. Instead he chooses people because he himself has mercy \add on undeserving ones\add*.

\v 14 Someone might ask me, "Is God unjust by choosing only certain people?" I would reply, "He is certainly not unjust!"
\v 15 God told Moses, "I will pity and help anyone whom I choose!"
\v 16 So God chooses people, not because they want God to choose them or because they try hard to please him. Instead, he chooses people because he himself has mercy on undeserving ones.

\v 14 What then will we say? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be.
\v 15 For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
\v 16 So then, it is not because of him who wills, nor because of him who runs, but because of God, who shows mercy.
