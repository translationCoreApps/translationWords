===== translationNotes: =====

  * **one cubit** - If it is necessary to use a modern measurement of length, here are two ways of doing it. AT: "46 centimeters in length" or "about one half meter in length" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]])
  * **he strapped it on under his clothing on his right thigh** - "he tied it to his right thigh under his clothing"
  * **thigh** - "upper leg"
  * **Now Eglon was a very fat man** - Here "Now" is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here the narrator tells background information about Eglon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
