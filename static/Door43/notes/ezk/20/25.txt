====== Ezekiel 20:25-26 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 I also allowed them to obey laws that were not good, and laws that would not enable them to live a long time \add if they obeyed them\add*.
\v 26 I allowed them to become unacceptable to me by sacrificing their firstborn children in the fire. I did that in order that they would be horrified, and in order that they would know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 So I also allowed them to obey laws that were not good, laws that would not help them live a long time.
\v 26 I allowed them to do things that made it impossible for me to accept them: I allowed them to sacrifice their firstborn children in fire. I allowed them to do that in order that they would be horrified at themselves, and in order that they would know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 Then I also gave them statutes that were not good, and decrees by which they could not live.
\v 26 I made them unclean by their gifts when they made a sacrifice of every firstborn of the womb and put them into the fire. I did this in order to terrify them so they might know that I am Yahweh!'

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the elders of Israel.

  * **Then I also gave them statutes that were not good, and decrees by which they could not live** - The words statutes in this phrase do not refer to God's law. God permitted them to live by human laws and judgments that were not good.
  * **gave them** - The word "them" refers to the children of those whom Yahweh brought out of Egypt.
  * **by their gifts** - Here the word "gifts" refers to the sacrifices that the people made to the idols that they worshiped.
  * **they made a sacrifice of every firstborn of the womb** - The phrase "firstborn of the womb" refers to the firstborn child of a woman. The word "sacrifice" can be translated with a verb. AT: "they sacrificed every woman's firstborn child" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **put them into the fire** - It is implicit that they put them into the fire in order to offer them as burnt offerings to their idols. AT: "sacrificed them as burnt offerings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
