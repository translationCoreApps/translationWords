====== Jeremiah 17 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 17:1-18, which is an extended quotation. This quotation is a continuation of chapter 16:19-21 and these should be seen as one section.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Trusting God or humans ==

Trust is an important part of this chapter. Those who trust in human wisdom will not prosper. Those who trust in God will have all of their needs met. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:trust]] and [[:en:obe:kt:wise]])


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Simile ==

The person who depends on the power of other people is compared to a bush in the desert which always has to struggle for life. But the person who trusts in God is like a tree growing by a stream and has all his needs supplied. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
