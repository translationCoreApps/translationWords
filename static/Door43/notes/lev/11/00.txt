====== Leviticus 11 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

== Laws about food ==

This chapter contains a list of the animals the Israelites were and were not allowed to eat. Further research may be needed to determine the exact location of different parts of an animal. Many of these foods are not consumed to this day because they cause diseases, but it is unclear why the other foods are prohibited.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ==
Eating unclean foods made a person unclean. The process of consuming these types of food spread the uncleanliness to a person. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:unclean]])
