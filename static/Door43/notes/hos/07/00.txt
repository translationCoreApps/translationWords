====== Hosea 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter continues using poetic forms to speak of Yahweh's anger over the sin of the people. The people are not seeking Yahweh; they are seeking other gods and looking for salvation from other nations like Egypt and Assyria. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]], [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]], [[:en:obe:kt:salvation]])
