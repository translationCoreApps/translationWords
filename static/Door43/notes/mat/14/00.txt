====== Matthew 14 General Notes======


=== Structure and formatting ===

14:3-12 mentions events that have previously occurred. Therefore, there is a break in the chronology of the narrative. The purpose of this break is explanatory; the translator will find it necessary to signal this break.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Irony ==

Herod believe that breaking an oath was dishonorable, so he ordered the execution of John the Baptist. However, the murder for which he was responsible was a much greater evil. This is irony. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
