====== Matthew 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and Formatting ===

Matthew 6 continues Jesus' extended teaching known as "The Sermon on the Mount." 

The translator may wish to set apart the prayer in 6:9-11 by using indentation. Since this chapter quickly shifts from one topic to another, it is possible to use a line of space between topic to distinguish between them more easily.
