\v 16 To those who  \add are on the way to hell, our message is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a foul smell  \add because it is about dying\add* and being separated from God forever. But, to those\add on the way to heaven, the message that we teach is like\add* a pure fragrant smell, \add because we tell them\add* that they will live  \add forever with God. As we think about that, we think\add* no one can have enough ability  \add to do\add* such important work  \add for God!\add*\f + \ft Or: how can anyone have enough ability  \add to do\add* such important work  \add for God\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 17  \add But perhaps God considers us\f + \ft exclusive \f* sufficient\add*, because we do not work\f + \ft Or: act \f* like so many  \add others whom you know\add*. They teach God's message in a way that  \add they think people will like, and they think that\add* people will pay them for teaching that way. We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* certainly do not do that\add*. On the contrary, \add as servants of\add* Christ, and knowing that God is watching us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, we teach sincerely  \add the message that\add* God sent us to proclaim.

\v 16 To those people that God does not rescue, that aroma of Christ is like the smell of a dead person dying once again. But to those whom God is rescuingâ€”they smell Christ, who is alive, coming to make them alive, too. Indeed, no one is able by himself to spread this fragrance!
\v 17 You know that many people go from city to city selling the word of God for money. But we are not like them. We work hard to please God and we do what he wants. And we speak about Christ because we know God sees everything we do, and we announce Christ because we are joined to him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 To the people who are perishing, it is an aroma from death to death. To the ones being saved, it is an aroma from life to life. Who is worthy of these things?
\v 17 For we are not like so many people who sell the word of God for profit. Instead, with purity of motives, we speak in Christ, as we are sent from God, in the sight of God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **it is an aroma** - "the knowledge of Christ is an aroma." This refers back to [[:en:bible:notes:2co:02:14|2:14]], where Paul speaks of the knowledge of Christ as if it were incense that has a pleasing smell. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **an aroma from death to death** - Possible meanings are 1) that the word "death" is repeated for emphasis and the phrase means "an aroma that causes death" or 2) "an aroma of death that causes people to die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the ones being saved** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the ones whom God is saving" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **aroma from life to life** - Possible meanings are 1) that the word "life" is repeated for emphasis and the phrase means "an aroma that gives life" or 2) "an aroma of life that gives people live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Who is worthy of these things?** - Paul uses this question to emphasize that no one is worthy to do the ministry that God has called them to do. AT: "No one is worthy of these things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **purity of motives** - "pure motives"
  * **we speak in Christ** - "we speak as people who are joined to Christ" or "we speak with the authority of Christ"
