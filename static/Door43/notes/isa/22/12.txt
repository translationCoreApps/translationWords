====== Isaiah 22:12-14 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels told you to weep and mourn;
\q2 he told you to shave your heads and to wear rough sackcloth
\q1 to show that you were sorry for the sins that you had committed
\q1
\v 13 But instead of doing that, you were happy and celebrating;
\q1 you slaughtered cattle and sheep,
\q2 \add in order to cook their\add* meat and eat it and drink wine.
\q1 You said, "Let's eat and drink \add all that we want to\add*,
\q2 because it is possible that we will die tomorrow!"
\p
\v 14 So the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels revealed this to me: "I will never forgive my people for sinning like this!"

\q1
\v 12 The Lord, Yahweh of hosts called on that day
\q1 for weeping, for mourning, for shaved heads, and the wearing of sackcloth.

\v 13 But look, instead, celebration and gladness, killing cattle and slaughtering sheep,
\q1 eating meat and drinking wine; let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.

\v 14 This was revealed in my ears by Yahweh of hosts:
\q1 "Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you, even when you die," says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts.
