====== Hebrews 09:13-15 ======

<usfm>
\v 13 The priests sprinkle on people goats' blood and bulls' blood and \add the water that has been filtered through\add* the ashes of a \add red\add* heifer that has been\add completely burned. By performing that ritual, they can ritually\add* cleanse the bodies of those who are \add ceremonially\add* unclean. Furthermore, performing those rituals enabled people to have fellowship with God again.
\v 14 \add So, because we know what\add* Christ \add accomplished when\add* his blood flowed \add when he died for us\add* \f + \ft personification, metonymy \f*, we will be very certain that we are not guilty \add for having\add* done those things \add that those who are spiritually\add* dead do. \add As a result\add*, we can serve the all-powerful God. \add The priests always offer to God animals\add* with no defects. Similarly, when Christ offered himself \add as a sacrifice\add* to God, he was sinless \f + \ft metaphor \f*. He did that as a result of \add God's\add* eternal Spirit \add helping him\add*.


\p
\v 15 \add By\add* dying \add for us\add*, \add Christ\add* \add redeemed\f + \ft Or: \add*set free from the penalty for their sins \f* even those who disobeyed the \add conditions of\add* \f + \ft Or: \add during the time of\add* \f* the first covenant. So, \add because\add* no \add one could be made perfect by obeying the old covenant\add*, now Christ establishes \add between God and people\add* a new covenant. He does that in order that those whom God has chosen may eternally have \add the blessings that God\add* has promised them.

\v 13 The priests sprinkle on people goats' blood and bulls' blood and the water that has been filtered through the ashes of a red heifer that they have completely burned. By performing that ritual, they then say that God will now accept that the people should worship him.
\v 14 If all that is true, then it became even more true when Christ, who had never sinned, sacrificed himself to Godâ€”he did this by the power of God's eternal Spirit. Because he sacrificed himself, God now forgives us for having sinned, for having done things that would have made us die forever. Now it is as though we had never sinned; now we can worship the true God. 


\p
\v 15 By dying for us, Christ made for God a new covenant with us. We were trying to please God by means of the first covenant, but we were still guilty of having sinned. When he died, he freed us from having to die for our own sins. As a result, all of us whom God has called to know him will receive what he has promised to give us forever.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the sprinkling of a heifer's ashes on those who have become unclean sets them apart to God for the cleansing of their flesh,
\v 14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
\v 15 For this reason, he is the mediator of a new covenant. This is so that, since a death has taken place to free those under the first covenant from their sins, those who are called will receive the promise of an eternal inheritance.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **sprinkling of a heifer's ashes on those who have become unclean** - The priest would drop small amounts of the ashes on the unclean people.
  * **for the cleansing of their flesh** - Here "flesh" refers to the entire body. AT: "for the cleansing of their bodies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **how much more will the blood of Christ ... cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?** - The author uses this question to emphasize that Christ's sacrifice was the most powerful. AT: "then certainly Christ's blood will cleanse our conscience even more from dead works to serve the living God! Because, through the eternal Spirit, he offered himself without blemish to God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the blood of Christ** - The "blood" of Christ stands for his death.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **cleanse our conscience** - Here "conscience" refers to a person's feeling of guilt. Because Jesus sacrificed himself, believers no longer have to feel guilty for the sins they have committed because he has forgiven them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **blemish** - This is a small sin or moral fault spoken of here as if it were a small, unusual spot or defect on Christ's body. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **cleanse** - Here "cleanse" stands for the action of relieving our consciences from guilt for the sins we have committed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **dead works** - Sinful deeds are spoken of as if they belonged to the world of the dead. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For this reason** - "As a result" or "Because of this"
  * **he is the mediator of a new covenant** - This means Christ caused the new covenant between God and humans to exist.
  * **first covenant** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:08:06|8:7]].
  * **those who are called** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "those whom God has chosen to be his children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **inheritance** - Receiving what God has promised believers is spoken of as if it were inheriting property and wealth from a family member. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
