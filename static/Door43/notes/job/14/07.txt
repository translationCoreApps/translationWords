===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 7 There can be hope for a tree;
\q if it is cut down, it might sprout again,
\q so that its tender stalk does not disappear.
\q
\v 8 Though its root grows old in the earth,
\q and its stump dies in the ground,
\q
\v 9 yet even if it only smells water, it will bud
\q and send out branches like a plant.
