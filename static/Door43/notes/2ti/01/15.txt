\v 15 You know that almost all the believers in Asia have turned away from me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
\v 16 But I pray that the Lord will be kind to the family of Onesiphorus. Often he helped me, and he was not ashamed that I am in prison.
\v 17 On the contrary, when he came here to Rome, he kept searching for me until he found me.
\v 18 May the Lord be kind to Onesiphorus on the final day. You know all the ways that he helped me in Ephesus.

\p
\v 15 You know this, that all who live in Asia turned away from me. In this group are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
\v 16 May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain.
\v 17 Instead, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and he found me.
\v 18 May the Lord grant to him to find mercy from him on that day. All the ways he helped me in Ephesus, you know very well.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **turned away from me** - Paul speaks of their ceasing to help him as if they had physically turned away from him. They abandoned Paul because the authorities had thrown him into prison. AT: "have stopped helping me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Phygelus and Hermogenes ... Onesiphorus** - These are names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **to the household** - "to the family"
  * **was not ashamed of my chain** - Here "chain" is a metonym for being in prison. Onesiphorus was not ashamed that Paul was in prison but came to visit him frequently. AT: "was not ashamed that I was in prison" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **May the Lord grant to him to find mercy from him** - "May Onesiphorus receive mercy from the Lord" or "May the Lord show him mercy"
  * **to find mercy from him** - Paul speaks of mercy as if it were an object that could be found. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
