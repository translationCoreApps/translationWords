\v 17 Many people in the crowd had not purified themselves, and therefore they were not able to kill the lambs \add and dedicate them\add* to Yahweh. So it was necessary for the descendants of Levi to kill the lambs for them.

\v 16 They stood in their place by their divisions, following the directions given in the law of Moses, the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood that they received from the hand of the Levites.
\v 17 For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves. Therefore the Levites slaughtered the Passover lambs for everyone who was not purified and could not consecrate their sacrifice to Yahweh.
