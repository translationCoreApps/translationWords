  * **Assyria is there with all her assembly** - AT: "The people of Assyria and all her army are there in Sheol" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **all of them were killed by the sword** - AT: "all of them died by the sword" or "all of them had died in battle." See how you translated "who had been killed by the sword" in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:31:17|31:17]].
  * **are set in the recesses of the pit** - "are in the deepest part of the pit"
  * **all of those who were killed, who fell by the sword** - AT: "all those whom enemies killed with swords" or "all those who died when enemies killed them in battle (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
