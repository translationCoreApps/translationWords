===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:disciple]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:amen]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:reward]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus finishes instructing his disciples about what they should do and expect when they go to preach.

  * **Whoever gives** - "Anyone who gives"
  * **one of these little ones** - "one of these lowly ones" or "the least important of these." The phrase "one of these" here refers to one of Jesus' disciples.
  * **because he is a disciple** - "because he is my disciple." Here "he" does not refer to the one giving but to the unimportant one.
  * **truly I say to you** - "I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **he will ... his reward** - Here "he" and "his" refer to the one who is giving.
  * **in no way lose** - "God will not deny him." This has nothing to do with having a possession taken away. It can be stated in positive form. AT: "God will certainly give him"
