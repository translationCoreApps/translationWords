===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh is high, yet he cares for the lowly** - Yahweh is above all creation in power, position, and authority. Yet his interest is in those who are humble in spirit, servants to all. This is a simple contrast.
  * **the proud he knows from far off** - This expression probably means that God is not faithful to those who are proud. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
