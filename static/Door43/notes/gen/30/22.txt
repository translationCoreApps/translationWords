====== Genesis 30:22-24 ======

<usfm>
\v 22 Then God thought about what Rachel wanted. He heard her prayers and enabled her to become pregnant.
\v 23 She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She said, "God has caused that no longer will I be ashamed for not having children."
\v 24 She named him Joseph, which sounds like the Hebrew words that mean 'I pray that he will give me another one.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **God called Rachel to mind and listened to her** - The phrase "call to mind" means to remember. This does not mean God forgot about Rachel. It means he considered her request. AT: "God considered Rachel and granted to her what she wanted" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **God has taken away my shame** - God causing Rachel to no longer feel ashamed is spoken of as if "shame" were an object that person could take away from someone else. The abstract noun "shame" can be stated as "ashamed." AT: "God has caused me to no longer feel ashamed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **She called his name Joseph** - Translators may also add a footnote that says: "The name Joseph means 'may he add.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Yahweh has added to me another son** - Rachel's first sons were through her female servant Bilhah.
