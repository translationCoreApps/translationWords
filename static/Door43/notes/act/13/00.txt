====== Acts 13 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 13:33-36, 41, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

The chapter marks the beginning of the second half of Acts which focuses on Paul instead of Peter. The church's ministry shifts its focus from the Jewish people to the Gentiles. Peter was the apostle ministering to the Jews, while Paul was the apostle who was responsible for the ministry to the Gentiles.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "A light for the Gentiles" ==
Light is a common image used in Scripture. The Jews were supposed to reveal the true God, Yahweh, to the Gentiles. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:light]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Old Testament history ==
A major part of this chapter involves recalling the history of the people of Israel. It will be difficult to understand and translate if the Old Testament has not yet been translated. Paul seems to focus on Jesus being the Messiah, and the promised descendant of David. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:christ]])
