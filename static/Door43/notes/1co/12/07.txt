<usfm>
\v 7 God makes it possible for each believer to show that he has some of the Spirit's power; God does this in order to help all believers together to trust him and honor him more.
\v 8 For the Spirit makes one person able to speak a message with great wisdom from God, and he makes another person able to pass on to others some knowledge from God.

  * **wisdom ... knowledge** - The difference between these two words is not as important here as the fact that God gives them both by the same Spirit.
