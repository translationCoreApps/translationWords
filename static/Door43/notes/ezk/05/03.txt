  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak to Ezekiel.

  * **a small number of hairs from them** - "a few hairs from the piles" 
  * **tie them** - The word "them" refers to the hairs. Possible meanings are 1) the hairs were long enough so Ezekiel could tie them or 2) Ezekiel was to sew the hairs or otherwise attach them 3) Ezekiel was to place the hairs loosely in a fold of the garment.
  * **the folds of your robe** - Possible meanings are 1) "the cloth on your arms" ("your sleeves") (UDB) or 2) "the end of the cloth on your robe" ("your hem") or 3) the fold in the garment where it is tucked into the belt.
  * **from there a fire will go out to all the house of Israel** - "from there a fire will spread out and burn up all the people of Israel." Yahweh speaks of how he will punish Israel as if he were going to set fire to a house and of the people of Israel as if they were the family that lives in that house but were at that time outside the house.
