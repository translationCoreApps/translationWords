== The tribe of Levi ==

The Levites were given a special function in Israel. They belong to or are specially dedicated to serve Yahweh. They were to be priest and because of this were held to a higher standard than the rest of Israel. Only one of Aaron's sons survived because the others offered improper sacrifices. This tribe had a lot of responsibility during this time. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:priest]])
