Then I sat down, very shocked\f + \ft Or: dismayed \f*. \add The Israelites knew that God had warned us that he would punish us if we disobeyed\add* what he had said to us \add about marrying women who are not Israelites\add*.
\v 4 So many of them trembled\f + \ft Or: were \f* afraid when they heard that some of those who had returned from Babylonia had sinned like that. They came and sat with me until it was time to offer the evening sacrifices \add of grain\add*.

\v 3 When I heard that, I was overwhelmed, so I tore my clothes and tore some hair from my head and from my beard. Then I sat down, ashamed of my people since the 
Israelites knew that God had warned us that he would punish us if we disobeyed what he had said to us about marrying women who are not Israelites.
\v 4 So many of them trembled when they heard that some of those who had returned from Babylonia had sinned like that. They came and sat with me until it was time to offer the evening 
sacrifices of grain.

\v 3 When I heard this, I tore apart my clothing and robe and pulled out hair from my head and beard, and I sat down, devastated.
\v 4 All those who trembled at the words of the God of Israel about this faithlessness gathered to me while I was sitting ashamed until the evening offering.
