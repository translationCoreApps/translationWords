====== 2 Chronicles 21 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Evil ==
Doing evil causes the country to decline. Jehoshaphat's son was evil. Edom and Libna successfully revolted against him, the Arabs plundered him and he died of an intestinal disease.  (See: [[:en:obe:kt:evil]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Simile ==

The author compares worship of Baal to being a prostitute: "to act like a prostitute." Idolatry by the people of God is often pictured as prostitution. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:obe:kt:peopleofgod]])
