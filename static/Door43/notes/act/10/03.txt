\v 3 About the ninth hour of the day, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him. The angel said to him, "Cornelius!"
\v 4 Cornelius stared at the angel and was very frightened and said, "What is it, sir?" The angel said to him, "Your prayers and your gifts to the poor have gone up as a memorial offering into God's presence.

\v 5 Now send men to the city of Joppa to bring a man named Simon who is called Peter.
\v 6 He is staying with a tanner named Simon, whose house is by the seaside."
