===== translationNotes: =====
  * **clothe yourself in glory and dignity; array yourself in honor and majesty** - The abstract nouns "glory," "dignity," "honor," and "majesty" are spoken of as if they were clothing that a person could put on. They can be translated as adjectives and verbs. AT: "make yourself glorious; do something great so people will respect you and honor you; make people think you are a great king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Scatter around the excess of your anger** - The abstract noun "anger" is spoken of as if it were more of something than a container could contain so that a person needed to spread it around. It is also a metonym for the actions a person takes when he is angry. You may need to make explicit why the person is angry. AT: "Be angry because people are proud, and punish them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **bring him down** - "take away everything he is proud of"
