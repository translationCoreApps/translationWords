===== translationNotes: =====

  * **look** - "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you."
  * **the big house will be smashed to pieces, and the little house to bits** - These two phrases share similar meanings. The contrast between "the big house" and "the little house" means that this refers to all houses. Possible meanings: 1) Yahweh will command others to destroy every house or 2) Yahweh himself will destroy every house himself simply by giving a command. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **the big house will be smashed to pieces** - AT: "the enemy will smash the big house to pieces" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **to pieces ... to bits** - You can use the same word for both of these phrases.
  * **the little house to bits** - AT: "the little house will be smashed to bits" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
