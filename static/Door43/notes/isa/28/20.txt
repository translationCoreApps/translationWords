===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Jerusalem.

  * **For the bed is too short for a man to stretch out on, and the blanket too narrow for him to wrap himself in** - This was probably a proverb that the people knew at the time. It means that what they believe will keep them safe from Yahweh's punishment will disappoint them like a bed that is too short or a blanket that is too narrow. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]])
  * **Yahweh will rise up** - Yahweh preparing to act is spoken of as if he were sitting and then rising up. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Mount Perazim ... Valley of Gibeon** - These refer to places where God miraculously defeated enemy armies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **he will rouse himself** - "he will become very angry"
  * **his strange work ... his strange deed** - These two phrases mean the same thing. This work is strange because God is using a foreign army to defeat the people of Jerusalem rather than helping the people of Jerusalem defeat their enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
