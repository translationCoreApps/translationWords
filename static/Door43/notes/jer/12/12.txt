===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Destroyers** - "destroying armies" 
  * **bare** - "not covered" or "empty"
  * **Yahweh's sword is devouring** - Here Yahweh speaks of the armies that he is using to punish his people as being his "sword." His"sword" is described here as if it were a large animal that attacked and devoured the people. AT: "for the armies are my sword that I am using to punish you" or "for I am sending the destroying armies to attack you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **from one end of the land to the other** - This refers to whole land that belongs to his people.
  * **They have sown wheat but harvest thornbushes** - "They have sown wheat, but there is nothing to harvest but thornbushes"
  * **They have** - "My people have"
  * **thornbushes** - a large plant that is covered in sharp points
  * **exhausted** - "worn out" or "tired"
  * **So be ashamed of your gain because of Yahweh's anger** - "So be ashamed of your tiny harvest because Yahweh is angry with you." Here the word "gain" does not mean a large amount of something, but refers to a small amount.
