===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 34 I wish\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that he would stop punishing \f + \ft metonymy \f* me,
\q2 and that he would not continue to terrify me.
\q1
\v 35 If he did that, I would declare \add that I am innocent\add* without being afraid of him,
\q2 because I know within myself that I really have not \add done what is wrong like God thinks that I have\add*."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 34 I wish someone else could stop God from making me suffer,
\q2 and that he would not continue to terrify me.
\q1
\v 35 If he did that, I would declare that I am innocent without being afraid of him
\q2 because I know within myself that I really have not done what is wrong like God thinks that I have.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 34 There is no other judge who could take God's rod off me,
\q who could keep his terror from frightening me.
\q
\v 35 Then would I speak up and not fear him.
\q But as things are now, I cannot do that.
