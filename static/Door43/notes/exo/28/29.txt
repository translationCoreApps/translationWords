\v 30 Put into the sacred pouch the two things—named Urim and Thummim—that the priest will use to determine my answers to the questions he asks. In that way, they will be close to his chest when he enters the holy place to talk to me. He will use them to determine what my will is for the Israelite people."

<usfm>
\v 29 When Aaron goes into the holy place, he must carry the names of the people of Israel over his heart in the breastpiece for decision making, as a continuing memorial before Yahweh.
\v 30 You are to put the Urim and the Thummim in the breastpiece for decision making, so they may be over Aaron's heart when he goes in before Yahweh. Thus Aaron will always carry the means for making decisions for the people of Israel over his heart before Yahweh.

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to tell Moses what the people must do.

  * **he must carry the names of the people of Israel over his heart in the breastpiece** - This refers to the names of the tribes engraved on the twelve stones the breastplate as described in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:28:17|28:17-21]].
  * **over his heart** - "over Aaron's heart" or "on his chest"
  * **the Urim and the Thummim ... the means for making decisions** - The second phrase appears to refer to the Urim and Thummim and explain their purpose.
  * **the Urim and the Thummim** - It not clear what these are. They were objects, possibly stones, that the priest used to determine somehow the will of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
