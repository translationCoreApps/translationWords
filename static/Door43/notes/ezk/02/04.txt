===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - God continues to speak to Ezekiel.

  * **Their descendants** - The word "their" refers to the past generations of Israel who had rebelled against God. The word "descendants" refers to current generation of people living in Israel.
  * **stubborn faces and hard hearts** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize how stubborn the people of Israel were because they would not change how they lived in order to obey God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **have stubborn faces** - "have expression on their faces that show that they are stubborn" or "are stubborn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **stubborn** - "unwilling to change"
  * **hard hearts** - This phrase suggests that the people resist God and are unwilling to obey him. The heart is used to describe the place in the body where a person decides what they want to do. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They are a rebellious house** - "They are a people who disobey God"
