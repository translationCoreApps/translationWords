\v 16 Then he said to me, "Son of man, I will cause the supply of food to Jerusalem to be cut off. Then the people will eat the small amounts of food and drink the small amounts of water that their leaders permit them to have, and they will be very distressed and anxious as they do that,
\v 17 because water and food will be very scarce. They will see each other becoming extremely thin, and they will be appalled; but this will happen because they are being punished for the sins that they have committed."

  * **I am breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem** - "I will stop the supply of food to Jerusalem."
  * **the staff of bread** - The supply is called a staff because some people need a staff to walk and do their work, and people need bread to live. Bread represents all kinds of food. AT: "the supply of food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
