====== 1 Kings 14:9-10 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 But you have done more evil things\f + \ft Or: deeds \f* than all those who \add ruled\add* before you. You have rejected me, and you have caused me to become very angry by making metal images of other gods so that you \add and others\add* could worship them.
\p
\v 10 So, I am going to cause terrible things to happen to your family. I will cause all your male descendants to die, young ones and old ones. I will completely get rid of your family \f + \ft metonymy \f*. I will get rid of your family \f + \ft metonymy \f* just like a man completely burns dung \add to cook his food\add*.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Instead, you have done evil, more than all who were before you. You have made other gods, and you have cast metal images to provoke me to anger, and have thrust me behind your back.
\v 10 Therefore, look, I will bring disaster on your family; I will cut off from you every male child in Israel, whether slave or free, and will completely remove your family, like someone who burns up dung until it is gone.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **thrust me behind your back** - Jeroboam has disrespected Yahweh like a person throws away something that is not wanted. AT: "completely rejected me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **look** - "pay attention." This word is added to indicate that what follows is important.
  * **I will cut off ... and will completely remove** - These two phrases are very similar in meaning and are repeated for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **cut off from you every male child in Israel** - Yahweh speaks of destroying Jeroboam's family and preventing him from having any descendants as if he were cutting them off as one would cut a branch from a tree. AT: "destroy every one of your male children in Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will completely remove your family, like someone who burns up dung until it is gone** - This simile compares the removal of every descendant of Jeroboam with the complete burning up of dung that was mixed with straw, dried, and burned for fuel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
