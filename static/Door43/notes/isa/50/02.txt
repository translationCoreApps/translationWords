====== Isaiah 50:2-3 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 2 When I came to you \add to rescue you\add*,
\q2 why did no one answer when I called out to you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q1 Was there no one there \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q2 Or, did you think that I do not have the power \f + \ft metonymy \f* to rescue you \f + \ft doublet \f*?
\q1 Think about this:
\q2 I can speak to a sea and cause it to become dry!
\q1 I can cause rivers to become deserts
\q2 with the result that the fish in the rivers die from thirst and rot.
\q1
\v 3 I cause the sky to become dark,
\q2 as though \f + \ft metaphor \f* it was wearing black clothes because it was mourning \add because someone had died\add*."
\b
\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 2 Why did I come but there was no one there? Why did I call but no one answered?
\q1 Was my hand too short to ransom you? Was there no power in me to rescue you? 
\q1 Look, at my rebuke I dry up the sea; I make the rivers a desert; 
\q1 their fish die for lack of water and rot.
\q1
\v 3 I clothe the sky with darkness; I cover it with sackcloth."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Why did I come but there was no one there? Why did I call but no one answered?** - These two sentences mean basically the same thing. Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that the people are in exile because they did not respond to him, not because he was unwilling to save them. AT: "When I came to you, you should have been there, but you were not. When I called you, you should have answered, but you did not." or "When I came to speak to you, you did not respond to me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Was my hand too short to ransom you? Was there no power in me to rescue you?** - Yahweh uses two similar questions to rebuke the people for believing that he was not strong enough to rescue them. AT: "My hand was certainly not too short for me to ransom you, and I had the power to rescue you!" or "I certainly have the power to rescue you from your enemies." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **I clothe the sky with darkness; I cover it with sackcloth** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. This means Yahweh has the power to make the sky dark. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
