<usfm>
\v 6 That message, which he has now revealed, is that because of our\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* relationship with Christ Jesus, \add all of us\add*, non-Jews as well as Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*, will receive the  \add great spiritual blessings that God has\add* promised as we all form one group \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add as a result of our believing\add* the good message  \add about Christ\add*.
\v 7 By God powerfully enabling me, and because God acted kindly toward me, doing what I did not deserve, and chose me  \add to do that work\add*, I became one person who tells others this good message.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 This hidden truth is that the non-Jews now share together with Jews the spiritual riches of God, and belong to the same group of God's people, and will share all the things God has promised them because they are joined to Christ Jesusâ€”this is the gospel.
\v 7 I am now God's servant to spread the good news, a work I did not deserve to do, but which God gave me working in me with his power.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 This hidden truth is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and they share the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
\v 7 For I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given to me through the working of his power.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **the Gentiles are fellow heirs ... through the gospel** - This is the hidden truth Paul began to explain in the previous verse. The Gentiles who receive Christ also receive the same things as the Jewish believers.
  * **fellow members of the body** - The church is often referred to as the body of Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in Christ Jesus** - "In Christ Jesus" and similar expressions are metaphors that frequently occur in the New Testament letters. They express the strongest kind of relationship possible between Christ and those who believe in him. 
  * **through the gospel** - Possible meanings are 1) because of the gospel the Gentiles are fellow sharers in the promise or 2) because of the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs and members of the body and fellow sharers in the promise.
