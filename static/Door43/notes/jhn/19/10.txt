\v 10 So Pilate said to him, "Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I also have authority to crucify you?"
\v 11 Jesus answered him, "You would have no authority over me at all, if God had not given it to you. So the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a worse sin."

\v 10 Then Pilate said to him, "Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?"
\v 11 Jesus answered him, "You do not have any power over me except for what has been given to you from above. Therefore, he who gave me over to you has a greater sin."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Are you not speaking to me?** - This remark appears in the form of a question. Here Pilate expresses his surprise that Jesus does not take the opportunity to defend himself. AT: "I cannot believe you are refusing to speak to me" or "Answer me!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "You should know that I am able to release you or to order my soldiers to crucify you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **power** - Here "power" is a metonym that refers to the ability to do something or to cause something to happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **You do not have any power over me except for what has been given to you from above** - You can translate this double negative in a positive and active form. AT: "You are able to act against me only because God has made you able" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from above** - This is a respectful way of referring to God. 
  * **gave me over** - This phrase here means to hand over to an enemy.
