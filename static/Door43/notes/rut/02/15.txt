\v 15 As she stood up to go back to work, Boaz ordered his workers, "Even if she gathers some grain near the bundles of grain that have been cut, do not try to stop her.
\v 16 Instead, make sure that you pull out some stalks of grain from the bundles and leave them on the ground for her to pick up, and do not scold her."

\v 15 When she got up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, "Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not say anything bad to her.
\v 16 And you must also pull out some sheaves for her from the bundles, and leave them for her to glean. Do not rebuke her."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **When she got up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men** - In the context of the commands, it is likely that Ruth was far enough away not to hear Boaz's instructions. AT: "And when Ruth got up to glean, Boaz privately told his young men"
  * **When she got up** - "When she stood up"
  * **even among the sheaves** - "even" here denotes "above and beyond what one normally does." Boaz instructs his workers to let Ruth glean around the bundles of grain. People who were gleaning were normally forbidden from working that close to the harvested grain.
  * **pull out some sheaves for her from the bundles** - "take some stalks of grain out of the bundles and leave them for her" or "leave behind stalks of grain for her to collect"
  * **Do not rebuke her** - "Do not cause her shame" or "Do not dishonor her"
