\v 3 But it was I who taught them to do everything good, as a father teaches his son to walk.
\q2 I was like a father, holding them by their little arms.
\q1 But they did not understand that I was the one who was taking care of them.
\q1
\v 4 With kindness I guided them, with the tender cords of human kindness I led them.
\q2 I loved them so much that I guided them and led by my own hand.
\q1 They worked very hard, like a yoke of oxen pulling a plow, but I made their yoke light and loosened its weight on their jaws, so they did not suffer pain.

\v 3 Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk.
\q It was I who lifted them up by their arms,
\q but they did not know that I cared for them.
\q
\v 4 I led them with cords of humanity,
\q with bands of love.
\q I was to them like someone who eased the yoke on their jaws,
\q and I bent down to them and fed them.
