<usfm>
\v 12 It was not the ideas that unbelievers teach that we accepted. Instead, it was the Spirit who came from God that we received, in order that we might know the things that God has freely done for us.
\v 13 Those are the things that I tell you about. As I do that, I do not tell you things that someone  \add whom others thought\add* was \f + \ft irony \f* wise taught me. Instead, I tell you truths that  \add God's\add* Spirit taught  \add me\add*, and I explain those spiritual truths to people whose thinking is guided by God's Spirit \f + \ft Or: I teach spiritual  \add truths to\add* spiritual \add people\add* \f*.

<usfm>
\v 12 The Spirit that God gave us is not a spirit that comes from this world. We received the Spirit who comes from God. This Spirit helps us understand all the gifts God freely gives to us.
\v 13 We teach these lessons that people schooled in the wisdom of this world cannot understand. These lessons are taught only by the Spirit of God. He helps us understand what these lessons mean.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 But we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we might know the things freely given to us by God.
\v 13 We speak about these things in words that man's wisdom cannot teach, but which the Spirit teaches us. The Spirit interprets spiritual words with spiritual wisdom.
