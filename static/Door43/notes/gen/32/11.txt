The second clarifies that the brother whom Jacob intended was Esau. AT: "from the power of my brother, Esau" or "from my brother, Esau" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I am afraid of him, that he will** - "I am afraid that he will"
  * **But you said, 'I will certainly make you prosper. I will make your descendants ... number.'** - This is a quotation within a quotation. It can be stated an an indirect quotation. AT: "But you said that you would certainly prosper me, and that you would make my descendants ... number" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]]) 
  * **make you prosper** - "do good to you" or "treat you well"
  * **I will make your descendants like the sand of the sea** - This speaks about the very large number of Jacob's descendants as if their number will be like the grains of sand on the seashore. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
