===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Hezekiah continues his written prayer.

  * **For Sheol does not thank you; death does not praise you** - Here "Sheol" and "death" refer to "dead people." AT: "For those in Sheol do not thank you; dead people do not praise you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **those who go down into the pit** - "those who go down to the grave" 
  * **do not hope in your trustworthiness** - "do not have hope in your faithfulness." Here "your" is singular and refers to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_yousingular]])
  * **The living person, the living person** - Hezekiah repeats this phrase to emphasize that only a living person, not a dead person, can give thanks to Yahweh. ([[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
