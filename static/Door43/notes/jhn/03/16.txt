<usfm>
\v 16 God loved us people \f + \ft metonymy \f* in the world so much that he gave his only Son \add as a sacrifice for us\add*, in order that everyone who believes in him would not be separated from God forever. Instead, they would have eternal life.
\v 17 When God sent his Son into the world, his purpose was not to punish the \add people in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the world for their sins. Instead, he sent him in order that they might be saved by him \f + \ft Or:he might save them \f* \add from being\add* \add guilty\f + \ft Or: punished\add* \f* \add for their sins\add*.
\v 18 Everyone who trusts in his Son, \add God says that they\add* will not be punished \f + \ft Or:that he will not punish them \f*. But God has already \add said that\add* everyone who does not trust in his Son will be punished \f + \ft Or:that he will punish everyone who does not trust in his Son \f*, because they have not trusted in what his only Son \add has done for them\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 God loved the world in this way: He gave his only Son, so that anyone who trusts in him would not die, but would have everlasting life.
\v 17 God did not send his Son into the world to pronounce sentence on it, but to save it.
\v 18 Everyone who trusts in the Son, God will never condemn. But everyone who does not trust in him, God has already put under his condemnation, because they did not put their trust in the name of the only Son of God.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him will not die but have eternal life.
\v 17 For God did not send the Son into the world in order to condemn the world, but in order to save the world through him.
\v 18 He who believes in him is not condemned, but he who does not believe is already condemned because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **God so loved the world** - Here "world" is a metonym that refers to everyone in the world. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **loved** - This is the kind of love that comes from God and is focused on the good of others, even when it does not benefit oneself. God himself is love and is the source of true love.
  * **For God did not send the Son into the world in order to condemn the world, but in order to save the world through him** - These two clauses mean nearly the same thing, said twice for emphasis, first in the negative and then in the positive. Some languages may indicate emphasis in a different way. AT: God's real reason for sending his Son into the world was to save it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **condemn** - "punish"
  * **not condemned** - "judged innocent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **Son of God** - This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
