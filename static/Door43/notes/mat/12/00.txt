====== Matthew 12 General Notes ======


=== Structure and Formatting ==

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 12:18-21, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The Sabbath ==

Obedience to the Sabbath is an important part of this chapter. However, Jesus distinguishes between following the Sabbath the way God commanded and following the rules the Pharisees created about the Sabbath. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sabbath]])

== "Blasphemy against the Spirit" ==

There is a great deal of controversy regarding properly identifying this specific sin. However, it seems to involve insulting the Holy Spirit and his work. Since part of his work is to convince people that they are sinners and that they need God's forgiveness, anyone who mocked this truth would be unwilling to come in repentance to God. For this reason, he would not be forgiven. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Brother and Sisters ==
This chapter introduces the concept of "spiritual" brothers and sisters. Scripture uses these terms to refer to the relationship between fellow Israelites. Here, those who follow Jesus are now referred to as brothers and sisters. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]] and [[:en:obe:kt:brother]])
