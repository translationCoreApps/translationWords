====== Ezekiel 14:12-14 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 13 "You human, if \add the people of some\add* country sin against me by abandoning me, and I punish [IDI] them by cutting off their food supply and by sending a famine, with the result that people and animals die,
\v 14 even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were there, they would save only themselves because of their being righteous. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare.

\v 12 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 13 "Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a sin so that I reach out with my hand against it and break the staff of its bread, and send out over it a famine and cut off both man and beast from the land;
\v 14 then even if these three men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were in the land's midst, they could only rescue their own lives by their righteousness—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **when a land sins against me** - Here the word "land" represents the people who live in the land. AT: "when the people who live in a land sin against me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **break the staff of its bread** - Yahweh speaks of the supply of bread as if it were a staff. The word "bread" represents all kinds of food. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:16|4:16]]. AT: "end the supply of its food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **cut off both man and beast from the land** - Yahweh speaks of killing people and animals as if he were cutting them off, like a person would cut a branch from a tree. AT: "kill both man and beast in the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
