===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He proclaimed his word to Jacob, his statutes and his righteous decrees to Israel** - These two lines mean the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh gave his law only to Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **his statutes and his righteous decrees to Israel** - The verbal phrase can be supplied from the previous line. AT: "He proclaimed his statutes and his righteous decrees to Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **his statutes and his righteous decrees** - The words "statutes" and "righteous decrees," along with "word" in the previous line, all refer to the law of Moses. If your language does not have different words for these terms, you may combine the two lines into one, using either "Jacob" or "Israel" for the people who received them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **they do not know them** - The other nations do not know Yahweh's decrees.
