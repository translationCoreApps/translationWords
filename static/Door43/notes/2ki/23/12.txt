\v 12 Josiah also commanded his servants to tear down the altars that the previous kings of Judah had built on the roof of the palace, above the room where King Ahaz had stayed. They also tore down the altars that had been built by King Manasseh in the two courtyards outside the temple. He commanded that they be smashed to pieces and thrown down into the Kidron Valley.
\v 13 He also commanded that the altars that King Solomon had built east of Jerusalem, south of Olive Tree Hill, be desecrated. Solomon had built them for the worship of the disgusting idols—the \add statue of the goddess\add* Astarte \add worshiped by the people in\add* Sidon \add city\add*, Chemosh the god of the Moab people-group, and Molech the god of the Ammon people-group.
\v 14 They also broke into pieces the stone pillars that the Israelite people worshiped, and cut down the \add pillars that honored the goddess\add* Asherah, and they scattered the ground there with human bones \add to desecrate it\add*.

\v 12 Josiah the king destroyed the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courts of the temple of Yahweh. Josiah smashed them into pieces and threw them into the Kidron Valley.
\v 13 The king ruined the high places east of Jerusalem, south of the mount of corruption that Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth, the detestable idol of the Sidonians; for Chemosh, the detestable idol of Moab; and for Milcom, the detestable idol of the people of Ammon.
\v 14 He broke the stone pillars into pieces and cut down the Asherah poles and he filled those places with the bones of human beings.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Josiah the king destroyed ... smashed ... threw ... ruined ... broke ... cut down ... filled** - It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people, perhaps Hilkiah and "the priests under him" ([[:en:bible:notes:2ki:23:04|23:4]]), helped Josiah do these things. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Kidron Valley** - place name. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:23:04|23:4]].  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **filled those places with the bones of human beings** - "covered the ground with human bones so people could not use it as a shrine anymore"
