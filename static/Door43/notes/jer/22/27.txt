===== translationNotes: =====

  * **this land to which they will want to return** - This refers to the land of Judah.
  * **Is this a despised and shattered vessel?** - It is not clear who is speaking in verse 28. 
  * **Is this a despised and shattered vessel? Is this man Jehoiachin a pot that pleases no one?** - Jehoiachin is spoken of as a pot that was completely worthless and not liked by anyone. The questions emphasize that he has no value or friends. AT: "Jehoiachin is as useless as a broken vessel and no one is happy with him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Why have they thrown him and his descendants out, and have poured them out into a land that they did not know?** - This question explains what will happen to the worthless Jehoiachin. AT: "Therefore the enemy will remove Jehoiachin and his family from the land and taken them to a foreign land." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **have poured them out** - Jehoiachin and his descendants are spoke of as if they had been poured out in another country like garbage from a vessel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
