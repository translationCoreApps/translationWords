\v 11 Surely bitter water and good water do not come out of the same spring!
\v 12 My brothers and sisters, a fig tree cannot produce olives. Nor can a grapevine produce figs. Neither can a salty spring produce good water. Similarly, we should speak only what is good, and we should not speak what is evil.

\v 11 Does a spring pour out from its opening both sweet and bitter water?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - After James stresses that the words of believers should not both bless and curse, he gives examples from nature to teach his readers that people who honor God by worshiping him should also live in right ways.

  * **Does a spring pour out from its opening both sweet and bitter water?** - James uses a rhetorical question to remind believers about what happens in nature. This can be stated in active form. AT: "A spring does not pour out both fresh and bitter water." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **brothers** - "fellow believers"
  * **Does a fig tree, my brothers, make olives? Or a grapevine, figs?** - James uses two more rhetorical questions to remind the believers about what happens in nature. AT: "A fig tree cannot grow olives, my brothers, nor can a grapevine grow figs." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
