<usfm>
\v 13 The next day, the leaders of the families and the priests and the Levites came together with Ezra to study carefully the laws that Yahweh had given to Moses.
\v 14 While they were doing that, they realized that Yahweh had told Moses to command the Israelite people to live in shelters during that month, \add to remember that their ancestors lived in shelters when they left Egypt\add*.
\v 15 They also learned that they should proclaim in Jerusalem and in all the towns that the people should go to the hills and cut branches from olive trees \add that they have planted\add* and from wild olive trees and from myrtle trees and palm trees and fig trees. They should make shelters from these branches, and live in those shelters during the festival, just as Moses wrote \add that they should do\add*.

\v 13 On the next day, the leaders of the families and the priests and the Levites came together with Ezra to study so they would gain insight from the words of the law.
\v 14 They read in the law how Yahweh had ordered Moses to command the people of Israel to live in temporary shelters that entire month, to remember that their ancestors lived in shelters when they walked in the wilderness.
\v 15 They also learned that they should proclaim in Jerusalem and in all the towns that the people should go to the hills and cut branches from olive trees and from wild olive trees and from myrtle trees, palm trees and shade trees. They should make shelters from these branches to live in during the festival, just as Moses wrote about this.

\v 13 On the second day the leaders of the ancestors' families from all the people, the priests and the Levites, came together to Ezra the scribe to gain insight from the words of the law.
\v 14 They found written in the law how Yahweh had commanded through Moses that the people of Israel should live in tents during the festival of the seventh month.
\v 15 They should make a proclamation in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, "Go out into the hill country, and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, and from myrtle, palms and shade trees, to make tents, as it is written."
