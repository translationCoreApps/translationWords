\v 17 The Lord Yahweh says this: Are you not the one of whom I spoke in former days by the hand of my servants, the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in their own time for years that I would bring you against them?
\v 18 So it will come to be in that day when Gog attacks the land of Israel—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—my wrath will mount up in my anger.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues telling Ezekiel what he is to say to Gog.

  * **Are you not the one ... bring you against them?** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he was the one who brought Gog to the land of Israel. AT: "You are the one ... bring you against them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **of whom I spoke** - "that I spoke about"
  * **in former days** - "in the past" or "a long time ago"
  * **by the hand of my servants** - Here "hand" refers to the fact that these prophets wrote down Yahweh's message. AT: "my means of my servants" or "through my servants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **against them** - "against the people of Israel" 
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **my wrath will mount up in my anger** - Here "mount up" means "rise up" and expresses that his wrath will increase. The words "wrath" and "anger" mean the same thing and emphasize how intense his anger will be. AT: "my anger will greatly increase" or "I will be very angry with you" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
