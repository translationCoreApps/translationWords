  * **A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you?** - Ephron meant that since he and Abraham were both so wealthy, 400 pieces of silver was a small amount.

  * **four hundred shekels of silver** - This is about 4.5 kilograms of silver. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]])

  * **the amount of silver that he had spoken** - "the amount of silver that Ephron had said"
  * **in the hearing of the sons of Heth** - The abstract noun "the hearing" can be stated as "hear" or "listening." AT: "so that all the sons of Heth could hear him" or  "while all the sons of Heth were listening" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the sons of Heth** - Here "sons" stands for those who descended from Heth. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:23:03|23:3]]. AT: "the descendants of Heth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
