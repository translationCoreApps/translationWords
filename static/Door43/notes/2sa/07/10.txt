\v 10-11 Formerly, during the time that I appointed leaders for my Israelite people, many violent groups oppressed them. But this will not happen anymore. I have chosen a place where my Israelite people can live \add peacefully\add* and no one will disturb them anymore. I will give them rest from \add being attacked by\add* their enemies. And I will defeat all your enemies.
\pi I declare to you that I, Yahweh, will enable your descendants to rule after you \add die\add*.

I have chosen a place where my people can live peacefully and where no one will disturb them anymore. I will make all their enemies stop attacking them. And I will defeat all their enemies.
\pi Tell David that I declare to him that I, Yahweh, will enable his descendants to rule after him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them there, so that they may live in their own place and be troubled no more. No longer will wicked people oppress them, as they did before,
\v 11 as they were doing from the days that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, I, Yahweh, declare to you that I will make you a house.
