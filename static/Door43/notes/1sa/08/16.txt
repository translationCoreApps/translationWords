===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Samuel continues to tell what things the king will take.

  * **the tenth of your flocks** - They will have to divide their flocks into ten equal parts and give one of those parts to the king's officers and servants. See how you translated "tenth" in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:08:13|8:15]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]])
  * **you will be his slaves** - "you will feel as if you are his slaves"
  * **you will cry out** - Possible meanings are 1) the people will ask Yahweh to rescue them from the king or 2) the people will ask the king to stop treating them so badly (UDB).
