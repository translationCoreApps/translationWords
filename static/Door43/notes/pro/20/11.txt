===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Even a youth is known by his actions** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "People know a young man by his actions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **whether his conduct is pure and upright** - "whether his conduct is pure and upright or not"
  * **his conduct** - "his deeds" or "what he does"
  * **pure and upright** - These two words basically mean the same thing and emphasize how good this young person is. They can be combined into one word if necessary. AT: "pure" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Ears that hear and eyes that see** - The same thought is repeated to emphasize that Yahweh made all our senses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
