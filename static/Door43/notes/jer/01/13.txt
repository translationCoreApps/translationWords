===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The word of Yahweh came to me a second time** - The phrase "The word of Yahweh came" is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this idiom in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01|1:2]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke to me a second time" or "Yahweh gave me this second message" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **whose surface is churning** - The surface refers to the surface of the water in the pot. Jeremiah could see the water boiling. AT: "whose water is boiling" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **tipping away from the north** - This means that it was tipping toward the south, where Jeremiah was in Judah.
  * **Disaster will be opened up out of the north** - "Disaster will be let loose from the north." This represents God causing disaster to come from the north to the south. AT: "Disaster will come from the north" or "I will send disaster from the north" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
