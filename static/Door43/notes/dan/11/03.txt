\v 3 A mighty king will rise up who will rule a very great kingdom, and he will act according to his desires.
\v 4 When he has risen up, his kingdom will be broken and divided to the four winds of heaven, but not to his own descendants, and not with his power when he had been ruling. For his kingdom will be uprooted for others besides his descendants.
