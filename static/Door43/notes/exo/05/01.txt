\v 1 Then Moses and Aaron went to the king. They said to him, "Yahweh God, whom we Israelite people worship, says this to you: 'Let my people go to the desert in order that they may have a festival to honor me!'"
\v 2 But the king said, "Yahweh is no one important. I do not need to pay attention to what he says, or let the Israelite people go. I do not know this Yahweh! Furthermore, I will not let the Israelite people go!"

\v 1 After these things happened, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: 'Let my people go, so they can have a festival for me in the wilderness.'"
\v 2 Pharaoh said, "Who is Yahweh? Why should I listen to his voice and let Israel go? I do not know Yahweh; moreover, I will not let Israel go."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **After these things happened** - It is unclear how long Moses and Aaron waited until they went to see Pharoah.
  * **festival for me** - This is a celebration to worship Yahweh.
  * **Who is Yahweh?** - Pharaoh uses this question to show that he does not recognize Yahweh as a legitimate god. AT: "I do not know Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Why should I ... let Israel go?** - Pharaoh uses this question to state that he has no interest in obeying Yahweh or in letting the Israelites go to worship him. AT: "He is nothing to me and I will not let Israel go!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **listen to his voice** - The words "his voice" represent the words God spoke. AT: "listen to what he says" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
