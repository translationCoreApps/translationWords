===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Or who has first given anything to God, so it will be paid back to him?** - Paul uses this question to emphasize his point. AT: "No one has ever given anything to God that he did not first receive from God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])  * **For from him ... through him, ... to him** - Here, all occurrences of "him" refers to God.
  * **To him be the glory forever** - This expresses Paul's desire for all people to honor God. You can make this explicit in your translation. AT: "May all people honor him forever!" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
