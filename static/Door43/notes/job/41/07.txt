  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to rebuke Job by asking him questions.

  * **Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?** - This can be translated as a statement. AT: "You cannot pierce his skin with your hunting weapons, nor can you pierce his head with fishing spears." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **harpoons** - large spears with barbed points that people use to hunt large sea creatures
  * **See** - "Pay attention to the important thing I am going to say"
  * **will not anyone be thrown down to the ground just by the sight of him?** - This generalization can be translated as a statement in active form. The words "the sight of him" the reason that the person will throw himself on the ground, is a metonym for the person being afraid and for the person throwing himself on the ground. AT: "Anyone who looks at him will be so frightened that he will throw himself on the ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
