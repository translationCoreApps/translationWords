===== translationNotes: =====

  * **With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men** - Eliphaz speaks of him and the other men having the wisdom of very aged men whom they had learned from as if they were physically present with them. AT: "We have gained wisdom from both the gray-headed and the very aged men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **gray-headed and the very aged men** - The phrase "gray-headed" is a physical description of the "very old men." AT: "the very old men who have gray hair." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **much older than your father** - This is an exaggeration. AT: "older than your father" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Are the consolations of God ... gentle toward you?** - This rhetorical question is an accusation, with the implicit answer to the question being "yes." This question may be written as a statement. AT: "You must think that the consolations of God are too small for you, the words that are gentle toward you"
  * **consolations** - "comforts" or "sympathies"
