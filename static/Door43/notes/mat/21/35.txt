\v 35 But the renters seized the servants. They beat one of them, they killed another one, and killed a third one of them by throwing stones at him.
\v 36 So the landowner sent more servants than he had sent the first time. The renters treated those servants the same way that they had treated the other servants.
\v 37 After he heard about this, the landowner sent his own son to the renters to get his share of the grapes. When he sent him, he said to himself, 'They will certainly respect my son and give him my share of the grapes.'
