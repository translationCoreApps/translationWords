====== 2 Corinthians 05:16-17 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 So, \add because I realize how much Christ loves all people\add*, I no longer think about people in the way that those who do not believe \add in Christ\add* think about \add them\add*. Before I \add was a believer\add*, I thought about Christ in the way that other non-believers did. But I do not think of him that way anymore.
\v 17 The fact is that God makes every one \add of us\add* who \add trusts\add* in Christ to be completely different \add than we were before\add*. Our old \add way of conducting our lives\add* is gone. We now have a \add completely\add* new way of \add conducting our lives\add*.

\v 16 Since we live no longer for ourselves, we judge no one according to the way the unbelievers judge. We once even viewed Christ by these human standards. But as Christians, now we judge no one like this.
\v 17 When anyone is joined with Christ and trusts in him, he becomes a new person. Everything from the past is gone—See!— God makes everything in you new.

\v 16 For this reason, from now on we do not judge anyone according to human standards, even though we once regarded Christ in this way. But now we do not judge anyone in this way any longer.
\v 17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. See, they have become new.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Because of Christ's love and death, we are not to judge by human standards. We are appointed to teach others how to be united with and have peace with God through Christ's death and receive God's righteousness through Christ.

  * **For this reason** - This refers to what Paul has just said about living for Christ instead of living for self.
  * **he is a new creation** - Paul speaks of the person who believes in Christ as if God had created a new person. AT: "he is a new person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The old things have passed away** - Here "the old things" refers to the things that characterized a person before they trusted in Christ.
  * **See** - The word "See" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
