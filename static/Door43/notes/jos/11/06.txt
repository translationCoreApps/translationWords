===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I am giving them all to Israel as dead men** - Yahweh enabling Israel to conquer the enemy army and kill all of the soldiers is spoken of as if Yahweh killed the soldiers and then gave them to Israel. AT: "I will enable Israel to kill all of them in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **hamstring their horses** - "cripple their horses by cutting their legs." This is a practice where the tendons in the backs of the legs are cut so that the horses cannot walk.  
  * **Merom** - This is the name of a place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
