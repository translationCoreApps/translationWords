  * **you turn back your feet from traveling on the Sabbath day, and from doing your own pleasure on my holy day** - Here "feet" refers to the traveling and work that the people did on all other days. God did not allow long travels or work on the day of rest. AT: "you stop traveling and doing what you want to do on the Sabbath, my holy day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
