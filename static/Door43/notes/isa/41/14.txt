===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Jacob you worm, and you men of Israel** - Here "Jacob" and "men of Israel" mean the same thing. AT: "you people of Israel who are like worms" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Jacob you worm** - Possible meanings are 1) that this refers to the opinions of other nations regarding the people of Israel or 2) that this refers to Israel's own opinion of themselves. Yahweh speaks of their insignificance as if they were a worm. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **declaration of Yahweh** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "declaration" is expressed as the verb "declared" or "solemnly said." AT: "Yahweh declared" or "Yahweh solemnly said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Holy One of Israel** - Translate this phrase in the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:04|1:4]].
  * **I am making you like a sharp threshing sledge ... you will make the hills like chaff** - Yahweh speaks of enabling Israel to defeat their enemies as if he were making the nation a threshing sledge that will level mountains. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a sharp threshing sledge** - A threshing sledge was a board with sharp spikes that someone would drag over the wheat to separate the grain from the chaff.
  * **two-edged** - This refers to the edges of the spikes that were attached to the threshing sledge. That they are "two-edged" means that they are very sharp.
  * **you will thresh the mountains and crush them** - Instead of threshing grain, Israel will thresh mountains, which represent the powerful nations that were Israel's enemies. AT: "you will thresh your enemies and crush them as if they were grain, even though they appear to be as strong as mountains" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **you will make the hills like chaff** - This line has a meaning similar to the previous line but represents the next step in the process of threshing grain. The hills, which represent Israel's enemies, will be like worthless chaff. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
