\v 25 Please do not pay attention to [IDI] what this worthless man Nabal has said. His name means 'fool', and he surely is a foolish man. But I, who am \add willing to be\add* your servant, did not see the messengers whom you sent to him.
\v 26 Yahweh has prevented you from getting revenge on anyone and killing anyone. I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that as surely as Yahweh lives and as surely as you live, your enemies will be \add cursed\add* like Nabal will be.

\v 26 Yahweh has prevented you from getting revenge on anyone and killing anyone. I hope that just as surely as Yahweh lives and as surely as you live, your enemies will be cursed like Nabal is.

\v 25 Let not my master regard this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I your servant did not see the young men of my master, whom you sent.
\v 26 Now then, my master, as Yahweh lives, and as you live, since Yahweh has restrained you from bloodshed, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now let your enemies, and those who seek to do evil to my master, be like Nabal.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Abigail continues to advise David not to take revenge.

  * **Let not my master regard ... I your servant ... the young men of my master ... my master ... my master** - Abigail speaks of herself and David as if they are two different people to show that she respects David. AT: "Do not regard ... I ... your young men ... my master ... you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **But I ... did not see ... whom you sent** - You may need to make explicit what Abigail would have done. AT: "But if I ... had seen ... whom you sent, I would have given them food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **bloodshed** - murder
  * **avenging yourself with your own hand** - The hand is a metonym for what a person does with the hand. Abigail assumes that David should allow Yahweh to take vengeance for him. AT: "taking vengeance yourself instead of letting Yahweh do it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **let your enemies ... be like Nabal** - Abigail speaks as if Yahweh has already punished Nabal. AT: "I hope that Yahweh will punish your enemies ... as he will punish Nabal" (See UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])
