===== translationNotes: =====

  * **we are your flesh and bone** - This phrase means "a relative." AT: "we are related to you" or "we are of the same family" - (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **In the recent past** - This is historical information. Saul had been their king before David. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]]) 
  * **You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become ruler over Israel** - These two clauses mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh had chosen David to be king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **You will shepherd my people Israel** - Here ruling over the people is spoken of as shepherding them. AT: "You will care for my people Israel" or "You will rule over my people Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
