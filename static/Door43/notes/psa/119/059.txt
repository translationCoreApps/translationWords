===== translationNotes: =====

  * **turned my feet** - To repent and choose to obey God's laws is like turning one's feet on a path to head in another direction. AT: "changed my direction" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I hurry and do not delay** - The writer expresses the same idea both positively and negatively in order to emphasize the urgency with which he obeys Yahweh's commands. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
