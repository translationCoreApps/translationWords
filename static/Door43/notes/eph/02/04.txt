\v 4 But God always acts very mercifully, and he loves us very much.
\v 5 As a result, even when we were \add spiritually\add* dead\f + \ft Or: \add as unable to please God as\add* a corpse \f + \ft metaphor \f* is \f* because we were habitually sinning, he enabled us to receive \add spiritual\add*, Or: \add eternal\add* life because of our relationship with Christ. \add Do not forget this: It is only\add* because God has acted so kindly toward you, in a way that you did not deserve, that you are saved \f + \ft Or:that \add he\add* saved you \f* \add from the guilt of your sin\add*!
\v 6 And \add it is as though\add* God gave us spiritual life when he caused Christ Jesus to be alive again after he died \f + \ft metaphor \f*. And \add it is as though\add* God caused us to sit \add and rule\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* with him in heaven,
\v 7 in order that he might show to everyone at all times in the future that he has acted toward us in an extremely kind way because of what Christ Jesus \add did for us\add*.

\v 4 But God acts very mercifully, and he loves us very much.
\v 5 We were like dead people, powerless to obey God, but then he made us live again by joining us to Christ. God has saved us because he has been very, very kind to us.
\v 6 He raised us up from among those who are like dead people, and he gave us seats of honor to rule with Christ Jesus in heavenly places.
\v 7 He did this to show in future times how kind he has been to us, for we are joined to Christ Jesus.

\v 4 But God is rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us.
\v 5 While we were dead in trespasses, he brought us to new life together in Christ. It is by grace that you have been saved.
\v 6 God raised us up together and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
\v 7 He did this so that in the ages to come he might show to us the great riches of his grace. He shows us this by means of his kindness in Christ Jesus.
