===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 you have abandoned \add me\add* their God, and you are chasing after \add other gods\add* on the tops of hills and mountains;
\q1 you burn incense under oak trees, poplar trees, and other trees
\q2 where there is nice\f + \ft Or: pleasing \f* shade.
\q1 So your daughters have become prostitutes,
\q2 and your daughters-in-law have committed adultery.
\b
\q1
\v 14 But it is not \add only\add* your daughters
\q2 \add whom I will punish\add* for having become prostitutes,
\q1 and it is not \add only\add* your daughters-in-law
\q2 whom I will punish for committing adultery,
\q1 because the men also are having sex with prostitutes,
\q2 and they offer sacrifices
\q2 with the prostitutes \add who search for men at the\add* shrines \add of the idols\add*.
\q1 \add They are all\add* foolish people, and they will all be ruined.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 They worship other gods in the places on the tops of the mountains where they have set up idols. They burn offerings to the idols up on those hills—
\q1 in all the places where they worship those idols—under the oak trees, poplar trees, and the terebinth trees—
\q2 because these trees give good shade.
\q1 Following your example, your daughters decided to become prostitutes,
\q2 and your daughters-in-law committed adultery.
\b
\q1
\v 14 But I will not punish the women for turning to prostitution,
\q1 or your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery.
\q2 It is the men who are doing the very same thing! 
\q1 The men sleep with prostitutes,
\q2 and they offer sacrifices in the houses of idols where there are prostitutes. 
\q2 It is true: "A people who have not lived as they were taught to live, will come to destruction."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains
\q and burn incense on the hills,
\q under oaks, poplars and terebinths,
\q because the shade is good.
\q So your daughters commit sexual immorality,
\q and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
\q
\v 14 I will not punish your daughters when they choose to commit sexual immorality,
\q nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery.
\q For the men also give themselves to the prostitutes,
\q and they offer sacrifices so they can commit immoral acts with sacred prostitutes.
\q So this people who does not understand will be thrown down.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **on the tops of the mountains ... on the hills** - It was common for the people to set up idols in these places, often called "high places" in the Old Testament.
  * **sacred prostitutes** - These were women who slept with men who came to worship certain idols. Sleeping with the men was viewed as a sacred action in honor of the false gods.
  * **So this people who does not understand will be thrown down** - Yahweh will destroy the nation of Israel because they do not understand or obey God's commandments. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
