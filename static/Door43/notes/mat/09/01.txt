===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The writer returns to the theme, which he began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:01|8:1]], of Jesus healing people. This begins an account of Jesus healing a paralyzed man.

  * **Jesus entered a boat** - It is implied that the disciples were with Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a boat** - This is probably the same boat as in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:23|8:23]]. You only need to specify this if needed to avoid confusion.
  * **into his own city** - "to the town where he lived." This refers to Capernaum.
  * **Behold** - This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of showing this.
  * **they brought** - "some men from the city"
  * **their faith** - This refers to the faith of the men and may also include the faith of the paralyzed man.
  * **Son** - The man was not Jesus' real son. Jesus was speaking to him politely. If this is confusing, it can also be translated "My friend" or "Young man" or even omitted.
  * **Your sins have been forgiven** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I have forgiven your sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
