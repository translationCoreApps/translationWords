===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - David continues speaking to King Saul.

  * **This uncircumcised Philistine** - This phrase is an insult and indicates that Goliath does not belong to the living God. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:17:26|17:26]].
  * **will be like one of them** - David is saying that he will be able to kill the Philistine just as he was able to kill the lion and bear.
