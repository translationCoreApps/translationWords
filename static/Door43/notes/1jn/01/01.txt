\v 1 I, John, am writing to you about the one who existed before there was anything else. He is the one whom we apostles listened to as he taught us. We saw him. We ourselves looked at him and touched him. He is the one who taught us the message about eternal life.
\v 2 (Because he came here to the earth and we have seen him, we proclaim to you clearly that the one whom we have seen is the one who has always lived. He was previously with his Father in heaven, but he came to live among us.)

\c 1
\p
\v 1 That which was from the beginning—which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at, and our hands have touched—it is about the Word of life.
\v 2 Also, the life was made known, and we have seen it, and we bear witness to it. We are announcing to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and which has been made known to us.

Here the words "we" and "us" refer to John and those who had been with Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]]) 
  * **General Information:** - Verse 1 is a partial  sentence. If you need to have a complete sentence, you can begin the sentence with verse 1, treat verse 2 as a parenthesis, as the UDB does, and complete the sentence with [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:01:03|1:3]].

  * **That which was from the beginning** - The phrase "That which was from the beginning" refers to Jesus, who existed before everything was made. AT: "We are writing to you about the one who existed before the creation of all things."
