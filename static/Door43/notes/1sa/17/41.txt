\v 41 Goliath walked toward David, with the soldier who was carrying his shield walking in front of him. When he got near David,
\v 42 he looked at David closely. He saw that David had a handsome face and healthy body, but that he was only a young man. So he sneered at David.
\v 43 He said to David, "Are you coming to me with a stick because \add you think that\add* I am a dog?" Then he called out to his gods to harm David.

\v 41 The Philistine came and approached David, with his shield bearer in front of him.
\v 42 When the Philistine looked around and saw David, he despised him, for he was only a boy, and ruddy, with a handsome appearance.
\v 43 Then the Philistine said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?," and the Philistine cursed David by his gods.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **with his shield bearer in front of him** - "and his shield bearer walked in front of him"
  * **he despised him** - "he hated him" 
  * **ruddy** - "healthy"
  * **Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?** - Here a dog represents a small animal that a person can easily kill. The word "sticks" refers to David's staff and shows Goliath's opinion that it is not a good weapon. Goliath uses this question to accuse David of insulting him. AT: "You insult me by coming at me with mere sticks as if I were just a dog!"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
