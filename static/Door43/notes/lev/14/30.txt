\v 30 Then the priest must sacrifice the doves or the pigeons, whichever that person has brought.

\p
\v 32 Those are the regulations for anyone who has a contagious skin disease and who is poor and cannot afford the usual offerings, in order that he can be with people again."

\v 30 He must offer one of the doves or young pigeons, such as the person has been able to getâ€”

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He must offer** - "The priest must offer"
  * **the one who is to be cleansed** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "the one he is cleansing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **infectious skin disease** - Translate these words in the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:13:03|13:3]].
  * **who is not able to afford** - Translate this so it is clear that the person does not have enough money to purchase a standard offering. AT: "who does not have enough money to buy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
