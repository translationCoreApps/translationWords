===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Other men, two criminals, were led away with him to be put to death** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The soldiers led away with Jesus two criminals to execute them also" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Other men, two criminals** - "Two other men who were criminals" (UDB) or "two criminals." Luke avoids saying "other criminals" because Jesus was innocent, even though he was treated as a criminal. Luke calls the other two men criminals, but not Jesus.
