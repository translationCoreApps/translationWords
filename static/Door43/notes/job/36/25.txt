===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they see those deeds only from far away** - Elihu speaks of people not being fully able to understand God's deeds as if people were only able to see those deeds from far away. AT: "they do not fully understand them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **See** - "Indeed." The word "See" here adds emphasis to what follows.
  * **the number of his years is incalculable** - This refers to how long God has existed. AT: "people cannot know how long he has lived" or "people cannot know his age" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
