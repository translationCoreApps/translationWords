\v 13 Now you Ephesians and other non-Jews have heard the true message, the good news that Jesus saves everyone who believes him. And you have believed in Christ and are joined to him, so it is as if God's Spirit had marked you on your foreheads to show that you belong to God.
\v 14 The Holy Spirit is proof that we will receive all that God has promised. All this is great reason to praise him!

<usfm>
\v 13 It was in Christ that you also, after you had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvationâ€”it was in him that you also have believed and were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit.
\v 14 The Spirit is the guarantee of our inheritance until the possession is gained. This is for the praise of his glory.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **it was in him that you also have believed and were sealed** - The Ephesian Christians believed in Christ and are spoken of as being in union with him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit** - Wax was placed on a letter and stamped with a symbol representing the person who wrote the letter. Paul uses this custom as a picture to show how God has used the Holy Spirit to assure us that we belong to him.

  * **The Spirit is the guarantee** - "The Holy Spirit is a pledge." God gave us the Holy Spirit as a promise of his gift of eternal life. 
  * **inheritance** - Receiving what God has promised believers is spoken of as though one inherits property or wealth from a family member. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
