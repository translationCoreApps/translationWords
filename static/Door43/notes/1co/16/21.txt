===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I, Paul, write this with my own hand** - Paul was making it clear that the instructions in this letter are from him, even though one of his co-laborers wrote what Paul was saying in the rest of the letter. Paul wrote this last part with his own hand.
  * **may he be accursed** - "may God curse him." See how "accursed" was translated in [[:en:bible:notes:1co:12:01|12:3]].
