===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Why should our father's name be taken away from among his clan members because he had no son?** - At that time, only sons received land as an inheritance. The daughters use this question to suggest that they should receive the inheritance and continue the family clan. This can be written as a statement. AT: "You should not remove our father's name from the clan members just because he did not have a son." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Give us land among our father's relatives** - This means that they are asking to inherit land near where their father's relatives are inheriting land. The meaning of this can be made clear. AT: "Give us land where our father's relatives live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
