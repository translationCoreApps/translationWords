====== Isaiah 44 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Yahweh's power ==
There is a prophecy in this chapter that names the king who will end the exile of the Jews from Babylon and rebuild the temple, even though the exile has not yet even occurred. This emphasizes that Yahweh knows the future, so the translator should translate Cyrus's name in this chapter. There are many other aspects of this chapter that show Yahweh's power as well. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:temple]])
