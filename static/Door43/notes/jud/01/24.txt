  * **without blemish** - Here sin is spoken of as if it were dirt on one's body or a flaw on one's body. AT: "where you will be without sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord** - "to the only God, who saved us because of what Jesus Christ did." This emphasizes that God the Father as well as the Son is the Savior.
