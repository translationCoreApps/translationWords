  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus tells a parable about two sons to rebuke the religious leaders and to illustrate their unbelief. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **But what do you think?** - Jesus uses a question to challenge the religious leaders to think deeply about the parable he will tell them. AT: "Tell me what you think about what I am about to tell you" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **he changed his mind** - This refers to the son reconsidering his thoughts as if he had several thoughts to choose. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
