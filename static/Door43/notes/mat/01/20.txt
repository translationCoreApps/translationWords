\v 20 While he was seriously considering this, an angel whom the Lord sent surprised him in a dream. The angel said, "Joseph, descendant of King David, do not be afraid to marry Mary. For what has been conceived in her is there by the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 She will give birth to a son. Since it is he who will save his people from their sins, name him 'Jesus.'"

\v 20 As he thought about these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, because the one who is conceived in her is conceived by the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 She will give birth to a son, and you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **As he thought** - "As Joseph thought"
  * **appeared to him in a dream** - "came to him while Joseph was dreaming"
  * **son of David** - Here "son" means "descendant."
  * **the one who is conceived in her is conceived by the Holy Spirit** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Holy Spirit caused Mary to become pregnant with this child" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **She will give birth to a son** - Because God sent the angel, the angel knew the baby was a boy.
  * **you will call his name** - "you must name him" or "you must give him the name." This is a command.
  * **for he will save** - Translator may add a footnote that says "The name 'Jesus' means 'the Lord saves.'"
  * **his people** - This refers to the Jews.
