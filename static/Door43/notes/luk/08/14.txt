\v 14 \add Some people are like\add* the \add soil that had roots of\add* thorny \add weeds\add* in it. They are people who accept \add God's message\add*, but later on they worry about things, and try to become rich, and enjoy \add things that give them\add* a lot of pleasure. So they do not become \add spiritually\add* mature.
\v 15 But \add some people are like\add* the good soil. They hear \add God's\add* message and accept it. They \add become\add* good, honest people, and they continue doing things \add that please God\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*."

<usfm>
\v 14 The seeds that fell among the thorny plants show what happens when people hear God's word, but then as they go on in life they allow such things as the worries, riches and pleasures of this life to crowd out God's word from their life. As a result, they do not become spiritually mature.
\v 15 But the seeds that fell on the fertile ground show what happens when people hear God's word and receive it with an honorable and upright heart. They persevere in believing and obeying the word, and so they produce good spiritual fruit.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 The seeds that fell among the thorns are people who hear the word, but as they go on their way, they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and their fruit does not mature.
\v 15 But the seed that fell on the good soil, these are the ones who, hearing the word with an honest and good heart, they hold it securely and bear fruit with patient endurance.
