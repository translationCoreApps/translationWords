====== 2 Timothy 04:3-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 \add Do these things\add* because there will be a time when people will not listen to good teaching. Instead, they will bring in many teachers for themselves who will tell them just what they want to hear \f + \ft idiom \f*. \add The reason that they will bring in such teachers is\add* that they want to do the evil things that they desire.
\v 4 That is, they will not listen to \f + \ft metonymy \f* what is true, but will listen instead to \add strange\add* stories from our ancestors.
\v 5 \add Furthermore, I command that\add* you always control what you think and do. \add Be willing\add* to endure hardships\f + \ft Or: suffering \f*. Your work should be telling people the message \add about Christ Jesus\add*. As you serve \add the Lord\add*, do everything that \add God has told\add* you to do.

\v 3 I tell you these things, because the time will come when people among us will not follow what God truly teaches. Instead, they will find many men who will teach that it is good to do anything they wish to do. In this way, they will always be looking for something new and different to learn.
\v 4 They will stop listening to the truth, and they will pay attention to foolish stories.
\v 5 But as for you, Timothy, control yourself no matter what happens. Be willing to endure difficult things. Do the work of preaching the Gospel. Complete the work you must do to serve the Lord.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 For the time will come when people will not endure sound teaching. Instead, they will heap up for themselves teachers according to their own desires. They will be tickling their hearing.
\v 4 They will turn their hearing away from the truth, and they will turn aside to myths.
\v 5 But you, be sober-minded in all things. Suffer hardship; do the work of an evangelist; fulfill your service.
