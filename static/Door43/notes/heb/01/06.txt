  * [[:en:obe:kt:firstborn]]

  * [[:en:obe:other:fire]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This first quotation in this section (All God's angels ... ) comes from one of the books Moses wrote. The second one (He who makes ... ) is from the Psalms.

  * **the firstborn** - This means Jesus. The author refers to him as the "firstborn" to emphasize the Son's importance and authority over everyone else. It does not imply that there was a time before Jesus existed or that God has other sons like Jesus. AT: "his honored Son, his only Son" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he says** - "God says"
  * **He is the one who makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire** - Possible meanings are 1) "God has made his angels to be spirits who serve him with power like flames of fire" (UDB) or 2) God makes the wind and flames of fire his messengers and servants. In the original language the word for "angel" is the same as "messenger," and the word for "spirits" is the same as "wind." With either possible meaning, the point is that the angels serve the Son because he is superior. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
