\v 13 Then they replied to the king, "That person Daniel, who is one of the people of the exile from Judah, pays no attention to you, king, or to the decree that you have signed. He prays to his God three times a day."
\v 14 When the king heard this, he was terribly distressed, and he applied his mind to rescue Daniel from this ruling. He labored until sunset to try to save Daniel.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **That person Daniel** - This is not a respectful way of referring to Daniel. They intentionally used this phrase to avoid giving Daniel the respect he was due as a chief administrator. 
  * **who is one of the people of the exile from Judah** - "who is an immagrant from Judah"
  * **pays no attention to you** - This idiom means he ignores the king. AT: "does not obey you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **he applied his mind** - Here "mind" refers to his thinking. AT: "he thought very hard about how" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He labored** - This refers to mental labor, rather than to physical labor.
