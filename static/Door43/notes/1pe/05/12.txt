===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I have written to you briefly through him** - Silvanus wrote the words that Peter told him to write in the letter.
  * **what I have written is the true grace of God** - "I have written about the true grace of God." Here the word "grace" refers to the gospel message, which tells of the kind things that God has done for believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Stand in it** - The word "it" refers to "the true grace of God." Being strongly committed to this grace is spoken of as standing firmly in one place, refusing to move. AT: "Remain strongly committed to it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The woman who is in Babylon** - Here "The woman" probably refers to the group of believers who live in "Babylon." Possible meanings for "Babylon" are 1) it is a symbol for the city of Rome, 2) it is a symbol for anywhere that Christians are suffering, or 3) it refers literally to the city of Babylon. It most likely refers to the city of Rome. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **who is chosen together with you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "whom God has chosen as he has chosen you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **my son** - Peter speaks of Mark as if he is his spiritual son. AT: "my spiritual son" or "who is like a son to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **with a kiss of love** - "a loving kiss" or "a kiss to show your love for each other" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
