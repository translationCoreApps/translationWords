===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 You caused the Red Sea to divide, with the result that your people walked through it on the ground without \add getting their feet\add* wet. \add After they were all safely on the other side\add*, you \add caused the water to come back again\add*, and you hurled into the deep water the \add soldiers of the Egyptian army\add* that were pursuing our ancestors. Their soldiers sank into the deep sea like stones!
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>

</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

  * **you divided the sea** - God divided
  * **you ... threw those who pursued them into the depths, as a stone into deep waters** - In this simile, the writer describes God throwing the Egyptians into the sea as easily as a person would throw a stone into water, and the stone would disappear under the water completely. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
