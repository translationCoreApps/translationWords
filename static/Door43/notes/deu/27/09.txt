===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **obey the voice of Yahweh your God** - Here the metonym "voice of Yahweh" refers to what he says. AT: "obey what Yahweh your God says" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I am commanding** - Moses is commanding. The Levites are there in agreement with Moses, but he is the only one speaking.
