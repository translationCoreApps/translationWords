\v 5 I will cause your capital city of Rabbah to become a pasture for camels, and the rest of Ammon, where your people are now living, to become only a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.

\v 3 Say to the people of Ammon, 'Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh. This is what the Lord Yahweh says: Because you said, "Aha!" over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into exile, 
\v 4 therefore,behold, I am giving you to a people in the east as their possession. They will set up camp against you and set up their tents among you. They will eat your fruit and they will drink your milk.
\v 5 I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the people of Ammon a field for flocks. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.

  * **Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh** - "Listen to this message from the Lord Yahweh"
  * **you said, "Aha!"** - The word "Aha" is a sound people make when they are happy about something. In this case the people were happy because bad things happened to Israel and Judah. AT: "you laughed" or "you cheered"
  * **over my sanctuary when it was profaned** - "against my sanctuary when the enemy profaned it." AT: "when the enemy army defiled my temple" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

  * **I am giving you to a people in the east as their possession** - "I will cause an army from a land that is east of you to come and conquer you"
  * **They will set up camp against you and set up their tents among you** - This can be translated as a new sentence: "They will set up tents and live in your country."
  * **the people of Ammon a field for flocks** - Here "the people of Ammon" refers to the land that belonged to the people of Ammon. AT: "I will make the rest of the land of Ammon a field for flocks." (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
