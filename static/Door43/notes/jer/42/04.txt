\v 4 So Jeremiah the prophet said to them, "I have heard you. Look, I will pray to Yahweh your God as you have requested. Whatever Yahweh answers, I will tell you. I will keep nothing back from you."
\v 5 They said to Jeremiah, "May Yahweh be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not do everything that Yahweh your God tells us to do.
\v 6 Whether it is good or if it is bad, we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God."

  * **Look** - "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **I will keep nothing back from you** - This can be stated in positive form. AT: "I will tell you everything the Lord tells me" 
  * **May Yahweh be** - This is a way of beginning an oath. AT: "We ask Yahweh to be" or "Yahweh will be"
  * **true and faithful** - These words share similar meanings in this context. They describe Yahweh as a witness whom no one will be able to contradict. AT: "trustworthy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Whether it is good or if it is bad** - The people mention both extremes to emphasize that they will obey no matter what Yahweh's answer is. AT: "Whatever he answers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **the voice of Yahweh our God** - Here "voice" represents what Yahweh says. AT: "what Yahweh our God says" or "we will obey Yahweh our God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
