\v 43 Laban replied, "These two women are my daughters, and their children are my grandchildren, and the animals are my animals. Everything you see here is mine \f + \ft hyperbole \f*! But what can I do today to keep my daughters or the children they have given birth to \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\v 44 I cannot do anything in order to keep them, so hey, we should make a peace agreement, you and I, and do something that will remind us about our agreement."

\v 43 Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the grandchildren are my grandchildren, and the flocks are my flocks. All that you see is mine. But what can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?
\v 44 So now, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it be for a witness between you and me."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But what can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?** - Laban uses a question to emphasize that there is nothing he can do. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "But, there is nothing I can do to bring my daughters and grandchildren back with me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **let it be for a witness** - Here the word "witness" does not refer to a person, but it is used figuratively and refers to the covenant that Jacob and Laban are making. The covenant is spoken of as if it were a person who is there when they agree to act peacefully to one another. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
