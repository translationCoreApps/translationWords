  * **whom I beheaded** - Here Herod uses the word "I" to refer to himself. The word "I" is a metonym for Herod's soldiers. AT: "whom I commanded my soldiers to behead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **has been raised** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "has become alive again" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **Herod sent to have John arrested and he had him bound in prison** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Herod sent his soldiers to arrest John and had them bind him in prison" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **sent to have** - "ordered to have"
  * **his brother Philip's wife** - "the wife of his brother Philip." Herod's brother Philip is not the same Philip who was an evangelist in the book of Acts or the Philip who was one of Jesus' twelve disciples. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]])
