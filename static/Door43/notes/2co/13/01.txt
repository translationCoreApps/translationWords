<usfm>
\v 1 \add In the Scriptures it is stated that when one person\add* accuses \add another of wrongdoing, you must not believe his\add* accusation \add right away\add*. \add First, you must listen to at least\add* two or three people who actually saw what happened. \add So keep in mind that\add* this will be the third time that I will visit you!
\v 2 When I visited you the second time, I warned you \add that I was going to punish all the wrongdoers among you\add*. \add And now\add* I am \add warning you\add* again while I am still away \add from you\add*. When I visit you this third time, I will punish those who were sinning \add at the time when I visited you\add* before \add and who are still sinning\add*, and I will \add punish\add* the others \add who have been sinning since then, if they have not turned away from their sinful behavior\add*.

\v 1 This is the third time I am coming to you to deal with these matters. The principle in dealing with these issues is what the scripture says: "Every accusation against another must be based on the testimony of two or three persons," not just one.
\v 2 When I was there on the second visit I said to those who had sinned and who had been charged before the church, and to the entire church, and I will say it again: I will not overlook these charges.

\v 1 This is the third time that I am coming to you. "Every accusation must be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses."
\v 2 I have already said to those who sinned before and to all the rest when I was there the second time, and I say it again: When I come again, I will not spare them.

  * **Every accusation must be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses** - This can be stated as active. AT: "Believe that someone has done something wrong only after two or three people have said the same thing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
