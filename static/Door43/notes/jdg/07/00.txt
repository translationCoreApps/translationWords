God said, "There are too many soldiers for me to give you victory over the Midianites. Make sure that Israel will not boast against me, saying, 'Our own power has saved us.'" By lowering the number of fighting soldiers, it emphasizes that the vicotry is achieved through God's power. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:glory]])
