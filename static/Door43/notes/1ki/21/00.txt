=== Structure and formatting ===

The story of Elijah continues in this chapter. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

God hates oppression but is forgiving to people who are sorry for their sins. Ahab wanted Naboth's vineyard to make into a garden for his palace, but Naboth refused to sell it. So the queen, Ahab's wife, told the civic leaders of Naboth's town to falsely accuse him and execute him. Elijah told Ahab that he would be killed in Naboth's vineyard and all his family destroyed. Ahab repented and showed he was very sorry for what he did, so God said it would not happen to Ahab himself but to his son. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:oppress]], [[:en:obe:kt:forgive]], [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and [[:en:obe:kt:repent]])
