<usfm>
\v 8 Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: 'I will bring \add your enemies to attack\add* you with their swords, and they will kill your people and your animals.
\v 9 Egypt will become an empty desert. Then the people of Egypt will know that it is I, Yahweh, \add who have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.'
\p You \add proudly\add* said, "The Nile \add River\add* is mine; I made it!"
\v 10 Therefore I am opposed to you and your streams, and I will cause Egypt to be ruined, and cause it to be an empty desert, from Migdol \add in the north\add* to Aswan \add in the south\add*, as far south as the border of Ethiopia.

\v 8 Therefore Yahweh the Lord says, 'I will bring Egypt's enemies to attack them with their swords; they will kill Egypt's people and animals.
\v 9 Egypt will become an empty desert. Then the people of Egypt will know that it is I, Yahweh, who has the power to do what he says he will do, and that he will punish the people of Egypt for saying that the Nile River is theirs because they made it.
\v 10 I am against you and your streams, and I will ruin Egypt and make it into an empty desert, from the city of Migdol in the north to Syene in the south, as far south as the border of Cush.

\v 8 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I will bring a sword against you. I will cut off both man and beast from you.
\v 9 So the land of Egypt will become desolate and a ruin. Then they will know that I am Yahweh, because the sea monster had said, "The river is mine, for I have made it."
\v 10 Therefore, behold! I am against you and against your river, so I will give the land of Egypt over to desolation and waste, and you will become a wasteland from the Migdol to Syene and the borders of Cush.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Pharaoh.

  * **Behold!** - "Look" or "Listen." This word adds emphasis to what is said next. This is the Lord's message to Pharaoh. AT: "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **I will bring a sword against you** - Here "sword" is a metonym for battle, and "bring a sword against you" is a metaphor for causing an enemy army to come fight against Egypt. AT: "I will cause your enemies to come fight against you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a sword against you** - The word "you" refers to the nation of Egypt. [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
