===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Stay away from people who talk in ways that insult God, because this kind of talk dishonors God more and more.
\v 17 This kind of words will spread like an infectious disease. Hymenaeus and Philetus are two examples of men who talk like this.
\v 18 These men have stopped believing. They say that the resurrection of the dead has already happened. In this way they convince some Christians to stop trusting in Christ.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Avoid profane talk, which leads to more and more godlessness.
\v 17 Their talk will spread like gangrene. Among whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus.
\v 18 These are men who have missed the truth. They say that the resurrection has already happened. They overturn the faith of some.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **which leads to more and more godlessness** - Paul speaks of this kind of talk as if it were something that could physically move to another location, and he speaks of godlessness as if it were that new location. AT: "which causes people to become more and more ungodly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Their talk will spread like gangrene** - Just as gangrene quickly spreads in a person's body and destroys it, what those people were saying would spread from person to person and harm the faith of those who heard it. AT: "What they say will spread like an infectious disease" or "Their talk will spread quickly and cause destruction like gangrene"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **gangrene** - "dying, rotting flesh." The only way to keep gangrene from spreading and killing the ill person is to cut off the affected area.
  * **Hymenaeus and Philetus** - These are names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **missed the truth** - Paul speaks of truth as if it were a target to aim at. Paul means that these men have not understood the truth and are teaching something false. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the resurrection has already happened** - "God has already raised dead believers to eternal life"
  * **They overturn the faith of some** - Paul speaks of the destruction of people's faith as if their faith were physically overturned. AT: "They destroy the faith of some people" or "They cause some people to stop believing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
