\v 12 My fellow believers, I want you to know that the \add troubles\add* I have experienced \add have not prevented me from proclaiming the good message to people.

\v 13 \add Specifically\add*, all the military guards who are stationed \add here in Rome\add* and many other \f + \ft hyperbole \f* \add people in this city\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f* now know that I am a prisoner \f + \ft metonymy \f* because I \add proclaim the good news\add* about Christ.
\v 14 Also, most of the believers \add here now\add* proclaim the message from God more courageously and fearlessly \add because\add* they trust the Lord \add more firmly to help them. They trust the Lord more\add* because \add they have seen how the Lord has helped me\add* while I have been a prisoner \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add here\add*.

\v 12 My fellow believers, I want you to know that the hard things I have suffered have not prevented me from proclaiming the good news to people. Instead, my hardships have enabled even more people to hear the good news about Christ.
\v 13 In particular, all the military guards here in Rome and many other people in this city now know that I am a prisoner because I proclaim the good news about Christ.
\v 14 Also, most of the believers here now proclaim the good news about Jesus more courageously and fearlessly because they trust the Lord more firmly to help them. They speak about Jesus more confidently because they have seen the Lord help me in prison to speak the good news.

\v 12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.
\v 13 As a result, my chains in Christ came to light throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else.
\v 14 Most of the brothers have far more confidence in the Lord because of my chains, and they have courage to fearlessly speak the word.

  * **Now I want** - Here the word "Now" is used to mark a new part of the letter.
  * **brothers** - Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women, because all believers in Christ are members of one spiritual family, with God as their heavenly Father.
