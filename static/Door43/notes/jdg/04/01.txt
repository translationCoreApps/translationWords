\v 1 After Ehud died, the Israelites did not obey Yahweh and they did evil things, and Yahweh saw what they were doing.
\v 2 So he allowed the army of Jabin, one of the kings in the region of Canaan, who ruled in the city of Hazor, to conquer the Israelites. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth (where many of those who were not Israelites lived).
\v 3 Sisera's army had nine hundred chariots made out of iron. For twenty years he cruelly oppressed the Israelites. Then they pleaded to Yahweh to help them.

\v 1 After Ehud died, the people of Israel once again did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh.
\v 2 Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was named Sisera, and he lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
\v 3 The people of Israel called out to Yahweh for help, because Sisera had nine hundred iron chariots and he oppressed the people of Israel with force for twenty years.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Ehud** - Translate this name the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:03:15|3:15]].
  * **what was evil in the sight of Yahweh** - Here "in the sight of Yahweh" represents what Yahweh considers or thinks about something. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:02:11|2:11]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan** - Here "hand" refers to Jabin's power over Israel. Yahweh's decision to give Jabin power over them is spoken of as if Yahweh had sold them to Jabin. AT: "Yahweh allowed them to be defeated by the power of Jabin king of Canaan" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Jabin ... Sisera** - These are the names of men (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
