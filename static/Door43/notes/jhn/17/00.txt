====== John 17 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter forms one long prayer.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The eternality of Jesus ==
This chapter makes it clear that Jesus existed before the world was created. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Prayer ==
Prayer can be a difficult concept to translate in cultures not familiar with this practice. Since Jesus is God, his prayers are not like the prayers of other men. This chapter can be especially difficult to understand because Jesus does not have a real "need" to pray in order to ask for help, and his prayers can also sound like a command. It would be unacceptable for someone else to pray in this manner.
