<usfm>
\q1
\v 6 I was angry with my people; I defiled my heritage
\q1 and gave them over into your hand, but you showed them no mercy;
\q1 you placed a very heavy yoke on the old people.

\q1
\v 7 You said, "I will rule forever as sovereign queen."
\q1 You did not take these things to heart, nor did you consider how they would turn out.
