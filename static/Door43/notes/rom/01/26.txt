\v 26 So God allowed the non-Jews to do shameful sexual things that they strongly desired. As a result, many women began sleeping with other womenâ€”something that goes against nature.
\v 27 Similarly, many men abandoned their natural relationships with women. Instead, they developed strong sexual desire for each other. They committed homosexual acts with other men, acts that were shameful. As a result, God has punished them by sicknesses in their bodies, which is the direct consequence of that kind of sin.

\v 26 Because of this, God gave them over to dishonorable passions, for their women exchanged their natural functions for what is against nature.
\v 27 Likewise, the males also left their natural function with women and burned in their lust for one another. These were males who did with males what is indecent, and who received in themselves the penalty that was due their perversion.
