\v 34 But \add now listen to what\add* I say to you: Never promise to do anything and then ask a superior being to affirm\add that what you are saying will happen. For example, do\add* not \add promise that you will give something and then ask spiritual beings in\add* heaven \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to affirm that you will do it\add*, because heaven is where God \add sits\add* on his throne \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to rule over people\add*.
\v 35 \add Also, do\add* not \add promise that you will give something and then ask spiritual beings\add* on earth \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to affirm that you will do it\add*, because the earth is where God rests his feet \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Also, do\add* not \add promise that you will do something and ask religious authorities\add* in Jerusalem \add to affirm that you will do it\add*, because Jerusalem is the city where \add God\add*, the great King \add rules\add*.

\v 33 "You have also heard that long ago people were told, 'You should never swear an oath by making up a lie! Instead, you should make your promises as you would if the Lord himself were standing before you.'
\v 34 But now I will say to you something more: Do not swear an oath for any reason! Do not ask the place where God lives in heaven to guarantee what you promised. That is where his great seat of power is and from where he rules over all things.
\v 35 And do not swear any oath on the promise that the earth would witness it. Do not do this, because the earth is where God rests his feet. Never swear an oath by the city of Jerusalem, because Jerusalem is the city that belongs to God, our great King.

\v 33 Again, you have heard that it was said to those in ancient times, 'Do not swear a false oath, but carry out your oaths to the Lord.'
\v 34 But I say to you, swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;
\v 35 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool for his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to teach about how he has come to fulfill the Old Testament law. Here he begins to speak about swearing oaths.
  * **General Information:** - Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The "you" in "you have heard" and "I say to you" are plural. The "you" in "you will not swear" and "you will carry" are singular.

  * **Again, you** - "Also, you" or "Here is another example. You"
  * **you have heard that it was said ... false oath** - Jesus makes it plain here that he agrees with God and his word. But, he is telling his hearers not to use what does not belong to them to try to make people believe their words. AT: "your religious leaders have said to you that God told ... false oath" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Do not swear a false oath, but carry out your oaths** - Possible meanings are 1) do not swear to the Lord that you will do something then not do it, or 2) do not swear by the Lord that you know something to be true when you know that it is not true.
  * **But I say** - The "I" is emphatic. This indicates that what Jesus says is equally important to the original commands from God. Try to translate this phrase in a way that shows that emphasis. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:21|5:22]].
  * **swear not at all ... city of the great King** - Here Jesus means a person should not swear on anything. It seems some were teaching that it was less offensive if a person did not keep an oath if they swore by something other than God, such as swearing by heaven, earth, or Jerusalem. Jesus says this is just as bad because they all belong to God.
  * **swear not at all** - If your language has a plural form for commands, use it here. "You will not swear a false oath" allows the hearer to swear but forbids false oaths. "Swear not at all" forbids all oaths.
  * **it is the throne of God** - Here "throne" refers to God's rule as king. AT: "it is from here that God rules" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **it is the footstool for his feet** - This metaphor means the earth also belongs to God. AT: "it is like a footstool where a king rests his feet" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for it is the city of the great King** - "for it is the city that belongs to God, the great king"
