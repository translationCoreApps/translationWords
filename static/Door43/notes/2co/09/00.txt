Paul uses three agricultural metaphors to give instructions about giving to those in need. Their overall purpose is to explain the point that God will reward those give generously. It does not gives specifics about how or when God will reward them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:reward]])
