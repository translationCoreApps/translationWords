====== 2 Corinthians 09:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Do not forget this: "\add A farmer\add* who sows only a few \add seeds\add* will not gather\f + \ft Or: reap \f* a large \add harvest\add*, but the one who sows a lot \add of seeds\add* will gather\f + \ft Or: reap \f* a large \add harvest\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*." \add Similarly, if you give just a little to help others, God will give you only a few blessings. But if you give willingly and cheerfully to help people, you will receive in return many blessings from God\add*.
\v 7 Each of you should decide within yourself how much you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* should give, \add and then give that amount\add*. You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* should not \add be thinking to yourself\add*, "\add I really\add* do not want to give this money." \add And you\f + \ft singular \f* should\add* not give \add just\add* because someone tells \add you to give. Instead, you should give willingly and cheerfully\add*, because God loves those who give cheerfully.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 The point is, anyone who sows very little seed will also have a small crop to harvest, but anyone who sows a great amount of seed will gather a great harvest.
\v 7 First decide in your heart how much money to give, so when you give it you will not regret doing it. You should not feel that anyone is forcing you to give, because God loves a person who is happy to give.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 6 The point is this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows for the purpose of a blessing will also reap a blessing.
\v 7 Let each one give as he has planned in his heart. Let him not give out of sorrow or compulsion. For God loves a cheerful giver.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the one who sows ... reap a blessing** - Paul uses the image of a farmer sowing seeds to describe the results of giving. As a farmer's harvest is based on how much he sows, so will God's blessings be little or much based on how generously the Corinthians give. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **give as he has planned in his heart** - Here the word "heart" refers to the thoughts and emotions. AT: "give as he has determined" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **out of sorrow or compulsion** - This can be translated with verbal phrases. AT: "because he feels guilty or someone is compelling him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **For God loves a cheerful giver** - God wants people to give gladly to help provide for fellow believers.
