====== 1 Corinthians 05:9-10 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 In the previous letter that I wrote to you, I said that you should not associate with sexually immoral people.
\v 10 I did not mean that you should not associate with unbelievers who are immoral, or who desire things that belong to others, or who forcefully seize things that belong to others\f + \ft Or: are swindlers \f*, or who worship idols. You would have to leave this world  \add to avoid all people\add* like that.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 I wrote to you, that you must not keep company with sexually immoral people.
\v 10 Of course, I did not mean that you should not associate with unbelievers who are immoral, or who selfishly desire many things, or who trick and cheat to take from others, or who worship idols. You would have to leave this world to avoid all people like that.

\p
\v 9 I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.
\v 10 In no way did I mean the immoral people of this world, or the greedy, or swindlers, or idolaters, since to stay away from them you would need to go out of the world.
