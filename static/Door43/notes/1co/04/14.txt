====== 1 Corinthians 04:14-16 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I am writing this to you, not to make you feel ashamed, but instead to warn you as \add though you were\add* my dear children.
\v 15 I say that because as \add an apostle of\add* Christ Jesus I \add was the first one who\add* proclaimed the good message to you. As a result, I was the one who enabled you to receive eternal life. So even if there were thousands of Christians who instruct you \f + \ft metaphor \f*, I am the only one who became \add like\add* a father to you.
\v 16 So I urge you to \add live for Christ\add* the way I do.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I am not trying to shame you, but I want to correct you as a loving parent would correct a child.
\v 15 If you had ten thousand teachers telling you about Christ, you would still have only one spiritual father. I became your father in Christ when you believed the good news that I preached to you.
\v 16 So I urge you to follow my example.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 14 I do not write these things to shame you, but to correct you as my beloved children.
\v 15 For even if you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
\v 16 So I urge you to be imitators of me.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I do not write these things to shame you, but to correct you** - "I do not intend to shame you, but to improve you" or "I am not trying to shame you, but I want to correct you" (UDB)
  * **correct** - "warn"
  * **ten thousand guardians** - This is an exaggeration of the number of people guiding them, to emphasize the importance of the one spiritual father. AT: "very many guardians" or "a large crowd of guardians" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **children ... father** - Because Paul had led them to Christ, he is like a father to the Corinthians. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel** - Paul is emphasizing firstly that his relationship with the Corinthians is most importantly "in Christ," secondly that it came because he told them the good news, and thirdly that he is the one who is like a father to them. "it was because God joined you to Christ when I told you the good news that I was the one who became your father"
