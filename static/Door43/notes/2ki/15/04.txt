\v 4 However, the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense at the high places.
\v 5 Yahweh afflicted the king so that he was a leper to the day of his death and lived in a separate house. Jotham, the king's son, was over the household and ruled the people of the land.

  * **the high places were not taken away** - "Uzziah did not have anyone take the high places away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Jotham, the king's son, was over the household** - Because Uzziah was a leper, he had to live in a separate house, so his son, Jotham, took charge over the king's palace.
