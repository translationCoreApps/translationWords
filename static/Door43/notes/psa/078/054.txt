===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer continues to describe what God did for the people of Israel.

  * **his right hand acquired** - The words "right hand" are a metonym for power. AT: "he won for himself using his own power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **assigned them their inheritance** - Possible meanings are 1) God assigned the Israelites their inheritance in the land in which the other nations had once lived or 2) God assigned to the nations he had driven out an inheritance somewhere else. "gave them land that would always be theirs"
  * **in their tents** - Possible meanings are 1) he settled Israel in their own tents in the land or 2) he settled Israel in the tents from which he had driven the other nations. Most of these "tents" were actually houses, both when the other nations lived in them and when the Israelites lived in them. AT: "in their homes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
