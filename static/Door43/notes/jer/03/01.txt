\q2 her first husband certainly must not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* take her back again \add to be his wife\add*,
\q1 because that would certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* cause the whole nation to become unacceptable to me.
\q1 But you have more \add idols than\add* prostitutes have men whom they have slept with!
\q2 So, \add why should I accept you if\add* you return to me?" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* says Yahweh.

\v 2 "Look up at the barren hilltops.
\q2 On every hilltop there are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add idols that you have worshiped\add*.
\q1 \add It is as though\add* they are all lovers with whom you have had sex.
\q2 \add It is as though\add* you have sat along the roadsides like an Arab, waiting \add to attack and steal things from\add* those who pass by.
\q1 Because of worshiping idols and all the other wicked things that you have done,
\q2 you have caused the entire land to become unacceptable to me.

\v 1 "People know that if a man divorces his wife and then she marries another man,
\q2 her first husband certainly must not take her back again to be his wife again.
\q1 She would be ceremonially unclean and she has broken the law of Yahweh.
\q1 This nation is like this woman.
\q1 But you have more idols than prostitutes have men whom they have slept with!
\q2 So, why should I accept you if you return to me? it is Yahweh who says this.
\q1
\v 2 "Look up at the barren hilltops.
\q2 On every hilltop you have given yourselves to the idols
\q2 in the way a prostitute gives herself to her lovers.
\q1 You sat along the roadsides like an Arab nomad who is always waiting in the desert for someone to come;
\q2 but you are waiting to have sex with those who pass by.
\q1 Your unfaithfulness is the worship of idols, 
\q2 and your prostitution is just like your idol worship.
\q1 The whole land is made unacceptable to Yahweh,
\q2 and your worship of idols is your prostitution and your wickedness is what made you unclean.

\c 3
\q
\v 1 "If a man divorces his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man's wife,
\q will he return to her again? Would that land not be greatly polluted?
\q You have lived as a prostitute who has many lovers; and would you return to me?â€”this is Yahweh's declaration.
\q
\v 2 Lift up your eyes to the barren heights and look! Is there any place where you have not had illicit sex?
\q By the roadsides you sat waiting for your lovers, as an Arab in the wilderness.
\q You have polluted the land with your prostitution and wickedness.
