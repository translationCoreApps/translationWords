\v 12 My fellow believers, we ask that you recognize as leaders those people who work hard for you. This means that you must respect these leaders as fellow believersâ€”you see how hard they work to help you grow in faith. These leaders guide you and they teach you how to live for the Lord.
\v 13 We ask that you honor them because you love them and because of the work they do. We also urge you to live peacefully with each other.


\p
\v 14 My fellow believers, we urge that you warn believers who want to live off what others give them instead of working. Also encourage believers who are fearful, and help all people who are weak in any way. We also urge you to be patient with everyone.
