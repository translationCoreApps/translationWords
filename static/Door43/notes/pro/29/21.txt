===== translationNotes: =====


  * **who pampers his slave** - "who allows his slave to avoid work and who treats his slave better than he treats other slaves" (see UDB)
  * **at the end of it** - "at the end of the slave's youth" or "when the slave is grown"
  * **there will be trouble** - These words translate a Hebrew word whose meaning no one knows for sure. Some understand it to mean that the slave will be weak, others that the slave will rule the household. Either way, the reader needs to understand that as surely as a man must discipline his son ([[:en:bible:notes:pro:29:17|21:17]]), he must discipline his slave.
  * **stirs up strife** - Causing people to argue more is spoken of as if it were stirring up or awakening arguments. Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:15:17|15:18]]. AT: "causes people to argue more" or "causes people to argue and fight." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **a master of rage** - This idiom means "a person who becomes angry easily." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
