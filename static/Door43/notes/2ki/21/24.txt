(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the garden of Uzza** - Possible meanings are 1) "the garden that had once belonged to a man named Uzza" or 2) "Uzza Garden." Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:21:16|21:18]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
