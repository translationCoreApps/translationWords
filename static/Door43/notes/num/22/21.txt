\v 22 \add Even though God had given Balaam permission to go, he was still angry\add*. So he sent one of his angels to Balaam. This angel stood in the road to block Balaam's path. As Balaam and the two servants were riding on their donkeys,
\v 23 Balaam's donkey saw the angel. The angel was standing in the road and was holding a sword in his hand, \add but Balaam did not see him\add*.

\v 21 Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the leaders of Moab.
\v 22 But because he went, God's anger was kindled. The angel of Yahweh placed himself in the road as someone hostile to Balaam, who was riding on his donkey. Balaam's two servants were also with him.
\v 23 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his drawn sword in his hand. The donkey turned off the road and went into a field. Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back to the road.
