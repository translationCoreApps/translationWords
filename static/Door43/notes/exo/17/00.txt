====== Exodus 17 General Notes ======

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
Moses uses several rhetorical questions in this chapter. The purpose of these questions is to convince people of their sin. Likewise, the people's rhetorical question showed their ignorance. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Wilderness of Sin ==
Sin is the name of a part of the Sinai Wilderness. It is not the description of a place, and it has nothing to do with sinning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
