\v 25 God has the right to choose from among both Jews and non-Jews, as the prophet Hosea wrote:
\q "Many people who were not my peopleâ€”I will say they are my people.
\q Many people whom I did not love before, I will say that I now love them."
\p
\v 26 And another prophet wrote:
"Where God told them before, 'You are not my people,'
\q
in those same places they are told that they will become children of the true God."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 As he says also in Hosea:
\q "I will call my people who were not my people,
\q and her beloved who was not beloved.
\q
\v 26 Then it will be that where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,'
\q there they will be called 'sons of the living God.'"
