===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer continues to describe what God did for the people of Israel.

  * **He allowed his strength to be captured and gave his glory into the enemy's hand** - Asaph speaks of God's strength and glory as if they were physical objects that people could capture and hold. The words "strength" and "glory" are probably mentonyms for the ark of the covenant. The word "hand" is a metonym for the enemy's power. This can be stated in active form. AT: "He allowed his enemies to capture the glorious ark of his covenant; he simply gave it to them so they could do whatever they wanted with it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
