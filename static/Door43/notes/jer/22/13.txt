\q
\v 13 Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, his upper rooms by injustice, 
\q who makes his neighbor work for him for nothing, and he does not give him his wages;   
\q
\v 14 he says, 'I will build for myself a large house with spacious upper rooms.'
\q So cuts out large windows for it, and he panels it with cedar, and he paints it red.'
