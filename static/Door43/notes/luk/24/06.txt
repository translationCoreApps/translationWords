===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The angels finish speaking to the women.

  * **but has been raised!** - "but he has been made alive again!" (UDB). This can be stated in active form. AT: "because God has made him alive again!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Remember how** - "Remember what"
  * **to you** - The word "you" is plural. It refers to the women and possibly the other disciples in addition. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **that the Son of Man** - This is the beginning of an indirect quote. It can also be translated with a direct quote as in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men and be crucified** - The phrase "must be" means this is something that would certainly happen because God had already decided that it would happen. AT: "it was necessary that they hand the Son of Man over to sinful men so they can nail him to a cross" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **into the hands** - Here "hands" refers to power or control. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **third day** - The Jews counted any portion of a day as a day. Therefore, the day Jesus was raised was the "third day" because it followed the day of his burial and the Sabbath day. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
