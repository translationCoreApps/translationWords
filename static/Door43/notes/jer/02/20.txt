====== Jeremiah 02:20-22 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 Long ago, you stopped obeying me \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and you would not allow me to lead you \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 you refused to worship me.
\q1 Instead, you worship idols that are under trees on the top of every hill,
\q2 and your young women have sex with \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add men at those places\add*.
\q1
\v 21 \add It is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* you were a grapevine that I planted
\q2 when it was a cutting from a very good vine.
\q1 So now it is disgusting that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* you have become like a rotten worthless vine.
\q1
\v 22 Your guilt from your sins is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* very bad stains on a cloth,
\q2 and you cannot get rid of those stains even by using very strong soap.
\q1 \add This is true because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.

\v 20 Long ago, you stopped obeying me and you would not allow me to lead you.
\q2 You refused to worship me, even though I saved you from being slaves.
\q1 Instead, you worship idols that are under trees on the top of every hill.
\q2 You love and worship those idols instead of me just like an unfaithful man loves a prostitute instead of his wife.
\q1
\v 21 It is as though you were the best grapevine that I could plant, 
\q2 and I planted you so you would grow from the very best seed.
\q1 So how could you change yourself from the best grapevine into becoming like a vine that is disgusting and rotten?
\q1
\v 22 Your guilt from your sins is like very bad stains on a cloth,
\q2 and you cannot get rid of those stains even by using very strong soap.
\q1 This is true because I, Yahweh, have said it.


\q1

<usfm>
\q
\v 20 For I broke your yoke that you had in ancient days; I tore your fetters off you. Still you said,
\q 'I will not serve!' since you bowed down on every high hill and beneath every leafy tree, you adulterer.
\q
\v 21 I planted you as a choice vine, completely from pure seed.
\q How then have you have changed yourself into a corrupt, worthless vine?
\q
\v 22 For even if you clean yourself in the river or wash with strong soap,
\q your iniquity is a stain before meâ€”this is the declaration the Lord Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **For I broke your yoke that you had in ancient days; I tore your fetters off you. Still you said, 'I will not serve!'** - Here "broke your yoke" and "tore your fetters off you" are metaphors for setting them free from slavery. The people of Israel had been slaves in Egypt. AT: "Long ago I released you from slavery, but still you refused to worship me!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **fetters** - chains used to restrain a person or an animal
  * **since you bowed down on every high hill and beneath every leafy tree, you adulterer** - What they bowed down to can be stated clearly. Here "adulterer" is a metaphor for someone who is unfaithful to God. AT: "You bowed down to idols and worshiped them instead of me, like an adulterous wife who is unfaithful to her husband" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **beneath** - below 
  * **I planted you as a choice vine, completely from pure seed** - God speaks of making his people into a great nation in Canaan as if they were the seed of a grapevine that he had planted. AT: " I, Yahweh, started you with a very good beginning, like a farmer who uses excellent seed to plant the best kind of vine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a choice vine** - "a vine of very good quality"
  * **completely from pure seed** - Here "pure seed" is the best seed that has not been mixed with seed that is not good. AT: "that grew from excellent seed"
  * **How then have you have changed yourself into a corrupt, worthless vine?** - God uses this question to rebuke his people for changing and becoming like a corrupt worthless vine. AT: "But you have changed yourself into a corrupt, worthless vine!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **your iniquity is a stain before me** - Something that is unacceptable to God is spoken of as being unclean. Here "stain" represents the constant reminder of Israel's sin. AT: "I see your sin like a stain" or "your sin is like a stain; your guilt remains" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **this is the declaration the Lord Yahweh** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See you you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
