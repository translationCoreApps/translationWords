This chapter introduces Samuel. It is the beginning of the section 1 Samuel 1-7 which tells about Samuel, the religious leader of Israel.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Two wives ==
This was a common practice in the ancient Near East. It was against the law of Moses. The men of Israel would have sinned if they married more than one woman. This type of marriage always creates problems because of jealousy. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]], [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and [[:en:obe:kt:jealous]])

== "Pay his vow" ==
It was customary for Israelites to promise God to make a sacrifice to him if God answered special prayers. Making such a sacrifice was called paying one's vow. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:vow]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Idioms ==

When Hannah wanted to assure Eli she was telling the truth, she used the idiom "as you live." This is a type of oath formula meaning "I promise you I am telling the truth." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

The author also uses the phrase "call to mind." This is a common idiom meaning "remember."
