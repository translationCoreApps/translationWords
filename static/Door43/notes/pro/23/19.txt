===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These verses continue the "thirty sayings" ([[:en:bible:notes:pro:22:20|22:20]]).

  * **Hear—you!—my son** - "Listen carefully, my son." The speaker speaks an extra word to make sure the hearer is paying attention.
  * **direct your heart in the way** - Deciding to do what is right is spoken of as if one person were showing another person the correct path to follow. AT: "make sure you do what is wise" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **gluttonous eaters of meat** - Possible meanings are 1) "people who eat more meat than they need to" or 2) this is a synecdoche for "people who eat more food than they need to." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **slumber will clothe them with rags** - The word "slumber" is a hyperbole for a person spending too much time enjoying food and drink. This activity is spoken of as if it were a parent putting clothes on a child. AT: "because they spend so much time eating and drinking, they will do no work and so will become poor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
