\v 16 After I gave the receipt of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh and said,
\v 17 'Woe, Lord Yahweh! Look! You alone have made the heavens and the earth by your great strength and with your raised arm. Nothing you say is too difficult for you to do.
\v 18 You show covenant faithfulness to thousands and pour the guilt of men into the laps of their children after them. You are the great and mighty God; Yahweh of hosts is your name.
