===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 "\add But it is wicked people who\add* are swept\f + \ft Or: carried \f* away by floods,
\q2 and God curses the land that they own,
\q2 and no one goes to work in their vineyards.
\q1
\v 19 Just like the snow melts away when it is hot and there is no rain,
\q2 those who have sinned disappear into the place where the dead people are.
\q1
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 However, those wicked people will disappear very quickly,
\q2 and God will curse the land that they owned;
\q2 no one will go any longer to work in their vineyards.
\q1
\v 19 Just as the snow melts away when it is hot and there is no rain,
\q2 those who have sinned will disappear into the place where the dead people are.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 18 Swiftly they pass away, however, like foam on the surface of the waters;
\q their portion of the land is cursed;
\q no one goes to work in their vineyards.
\q
\v 19 As drought and heat melt away the snow into waters, 
\q so Sheol takes away those who have sinned.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Job continues speaking.

  * **like foam on the surface of the waters** - Foam lasts only a short time. This emphasizes how quickly God will cause the wicked to disappear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **their portion of the land is cursed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God curses the part of the land that they own" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **As drought and heat melt away ... those who have sinned** - Job says that sinners will disappear in Sheol in the same way as snow melts and disappears when it becomes warm. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **drought and heat** - These two words describe essentially the same weather and are used together to describe it fully. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
