\v 4 While he was on the hilltop, God met him, and Balaam said to him, "I have built seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on each one."
\v 5 Yahweh put a message in Balaam's mouth and said, "Return to Balak and speak to him."
\v 6 So Balaam returned to Balak, who was standing by his burnt offering, and all the leaders of Moab were with him.
