====== Jeremiah 37 General Notes ======


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Ironic situation ==

Jeremiah was thrown into prison and beaten for prophesying word of God. Then the king asked him, "Is there any word from Yahweh?" This is a type of irony. The king simply did not agree with God's original word. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:wordofgod]])
