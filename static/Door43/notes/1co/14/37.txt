\v 37 Those of you who think that you have the ability to speak messages that come directly from God, or think that you have some other ability \add that God's\add* Spirit gives, should realize that the things that I have written about in this letter are things that the Lord has commanded.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 Those of you who think you are prophets or spiritual should agree that the things I write are what the Lord has commanded and follow what I have written.
