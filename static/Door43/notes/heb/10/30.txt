\v 30 We can be sure of this, since we know that God said, "The right and power to give people what they deserve for having sinned belongs to me. I will punish them as they deserve." And Moses wrote, "The Lord will judge his people."
\v 31 It will be a terrible thing if the all-powerful God who really lives seizes and punishes you!

\v 30 For we know the one who said, "Vengeance belongs to me; I will pay back." And again, "The Lord will judge his people."
\v 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God!
