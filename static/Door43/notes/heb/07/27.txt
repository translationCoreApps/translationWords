\v 27 The Jewish high priests need to sacrifice animals day by day as well as year by year. They do this, firstly, to cover their own sins, and then to cover the sins of other people. But because Jesus never sinned, he does not need to do that. The only thing he needed to do to save people was to sacrifice himself once, and that is exactly what he did!
\v 28 We need a high priest like Jesus, because the priests, who were appointed as commanded in the law, sinned like all humans sin. But God solemnly declared after he had given his laws to Moses that he would appoint his Son to be high priest. Now his Son, who is God the Son, Jesus, is forever the only perfect high priest.

\v 27 He does not need, unlike the high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He did this once for all, when he offered himself.
\v 28 For the law appoints as high priests men who have weaknesses. But the word of the oath, which came after the law, appointed a Son, who has been made perfect forever.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here the words "He" and "himself" refer to Christ. The word "his" refers to earthly high priests.

  * **the law appoints** - Here "the law" is a metonym that stands for God, who established the law. It was according to the law the Israelites appointed their priests. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **men who have weaknesses** - "men who are spiritually weak" or "men who are weak against sin"
  * **the word of the oath, which came after the law, appointed a Son** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "word" is expressed as the verb "swore." AT: "after he had given the law, God swore an oath and appointed his Son" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]]) 
  * **the word of the oath** - The "oath" is personified and presented as if it were a person who spoke. (See: [[:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Son** - This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **who has been made perfect** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "who has completely obeyed God and become mature" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
