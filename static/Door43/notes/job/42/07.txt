\v 7 After Yahweh said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz, "I am angry with you and your two friends, \add Bildad and Zophar\add*, because what my servant Job said about me was right\f + \ft Or: true \f*, but what you have spoken about me was not right\f + \ft Or: true \f*.
\v 8 So now you must take to Job seven young bulls and seven rams and \add kill them and\add* burn them on the altar as a sacrifice for yourselves. Then Job will pray for you, and I will do what he requests me to do, \add and I will forgive you for speaking wrongly about me\add*. I will not punish you, even though you deserve to be punished, because what you said about me was not right\f + \ft Or: true \f*, but what Job said about me was right\f + \ft Or: true \f*."
\p
\v 9 So Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar did what Yahweh commanded them to do, and Yahweh did what Job requested him to do \add for the three of them\add*.

Then Job will pray for you, and I will do what he requests me to do. I will forgive you for speaking wrongly about me. I will not punish you, even though you deserve to be punished, because what you said about me was not right."

\v 7 It came about that after he had said these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has done.
\v 8 Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer, so that I may not deal with you after your folly. You
have not said what is right about me, as my servant Job has done."
\v 9 So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as Yahweh had commanded them, and Yahweh accepted Job.
