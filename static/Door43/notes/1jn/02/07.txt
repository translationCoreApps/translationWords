\v 7 Dear friends, I am not writing a new \add additional\add* command to you. Instead, I am writing to you a command which you have had since you first \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add believed in Christ\add*. That command is \add part of\add* the message that you have \add always\add* heard.
\v 8 Nevertheless, \add I can say that\add* the command I am writing to you is a new command. \add It is new because\add* what Christ \add did\add* was new, and what you \add are doing\add* is new, because \add you have been ceasing to conduct your lives in a morally impure manner\add* and \add are now truly conducting your lives in a pure manner. That is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* no longer \add living in\add* darkness. Instead, \add it is like\add* living where a brilliant light is already shining.

\v 7 Dear friends, I am not writing that you must do something new. Instead, I am writing something that you have known to do since you first believed in Christ. This is part of the message that you have always heard.
\v 8 But I will say something again to you on this same topic: I can say that I am telling you to do something new. It is new because what Christ did was new, and what you are doing is new. This is because you are ceasing to do evil and you are doing more and more good. It is like when night passes away and day dawns, the true day of Christ.

\v 7 Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you heard.
\v 8 Yet I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in Christ and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.
