====== 1 Timothy 06:1-2 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 As for slaves \f + \ft doublet \f* \add who are believers, teach them that they\add* should consider that it is right for them to honor their masters in every way. If they do that, people will not speak against\f + \ft Or: evil about \f* God \f + \ft metonymy \f* and they will not speak against\f + \ft Or: evil about \f* that which  \add we apostles\add* teach, \add because they will see that the slaves are being respectful of their masters\add*.
\p
\v 2  \add Slaves\add* who have masters who believe  \add in Christ\add* must not be disrespectful to their masters just because their masters are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve  \add their masters\add* even better because  \add their masters\add* are fellow believers whom  \add God\add* loves and who benefit when  \add the slaves\add* serve them well.
\p
As you teach these things  \add to your congregation\add*, exhort\f + \ft Or: urge \f*  \add people\add* that they do them.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 As for believers who are slaves, they should honor their masters in every way, so that no one will insult God or what we teach.
\p
\v 2 Slaves who have believing masters should not respect them less, for they are brothers. Instead, they should serve their masters even better, because the masters whom they serve are their brothers whom they should love. Teach and announce these things to the believers.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Let all who are under the yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy of all honor. They should do this so that the name of God and the teaching might not be blasphemed.
\v 2 The slaves who have believing masters should not disrespect them because they are brothers. Instead, they should serve them all the more. For the masters who are helped by their work are believers and are loved. Teach and declare these things.
