\v 25 So I rebuked those men, and I asked \add God\add* to curse them, and I pulled out \add some of\add* their hair. Then I forced them to solemnly promise, knowing that God \f + \ft metonymy \f* was \add listening\add*, that they would never again marry foreigners, and never allow their children to marry foreigners.
\v 26 \add I said to them\add*, "Solomon, the king of Israel, sinned \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* as a result of \add marrying\add* foreign women. He was greater than any of the kings of other nations. God loved him, and caused him to become the king of all the Israelite people, but his foreign wives caused even him to sin.
\v 27 \add Do you think that\add* we should do what you have done, and disobey our God by marrying foreign women \add who worship idols\add*? \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"

\v 25 So I rebuked those men, and I asked God to curse them, and I struck some of them with my fists, and some of them I pulled out their hair! Then I forced them to make a solemn promise, knowing that God was listening, that they would never again marry foreigners and never allow their children to marry foreigners.
\v 26 I said to them, "Solomon, the king of Israel, sinned as a result of marrying foreign women. He was greater than any of the kings of other nations. God loved him and set him as the king over all the people of Israel. But his foreign wives caused even him to sin.
\v 27 Do you think that we should do what you have done, you who married foreign wives, and do what we know is wrong, and commit a great sin against our God by marrying foreign women who worship idols?"

\v 25 I confronted them, and I cursed them, and I hit some of them and pulled out their hair. I made them swear by God, saying, "You shall not give your daughters to their sons, or take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.
\v 26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of these women? Among many nations there was no king like him, and he was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless, his foreign wives caused him to sin.
\v 27 Should we then listen to you and do all this great evil, and act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?"
