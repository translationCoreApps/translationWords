<usfm>
\v 26 It seems that you are writing things to accuse me of having sinned,
\q2 and that you are writing down even the bad things I did when I was young.
\q1
\v 27 It is as though you have put my feet in stocks
\q2 and that you were watching me wherever I walk;
\q2 it is as though you were following my footprints to see where I have gone.
\q1
\v 28 Because of this, my body is falling apart like rotten wood,
\q2 like a piece of cloth that the larvae of moths are eating.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 26 For you write down bitter things against me;
\q you make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.
\q
\v 27 You also put my feet in the stocks;
\q you closely watch all my paths;
\q you examine the ground where the soles of my feet have walked
\q
\v 28 although I am like a rotten thing that wastes away,
\q like a garment that moths have eaten.
</usfm>
