===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 \add And, although they will\add* pretend that they worship God, they will not let \add God's Spirit\add* work powerfully \add in their lives\add*. Do not associate with such people \f + \ft Or: Do not let such people join \add your congregation\add* \f*,
\v 6 because some such \add people, even now\add*, subtly\f + \ft Or: deceivingly \f* persuade foolish women to let them come into their houses, and then they deceive those women \add so that they control what those women think. These women\add* have been burdened with sins \f + \ft Or:have sinned very much \f* and they have been led to do \f + \ft Or:they do \f* the many \add evil\add* things that they strongly desire to do.
\v 7 \add Even though\add* they are always \add wanting to\add* learn new things, they are never able to recognize what is true.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 They will seem to honor God, but they will refuse to accept the power that God truly wants to give them. Stay away from people like this.
\v 6 These men persuade foolish women to let them come into their houses. Then they deceive those women so that they control what they think. These are women who sin all the time, so they follow these evil men into doing all sorts of bad things that they enjoy doing.
\v 7 Even though these women are always wanting to learn new things, they are never able to learn what is actually true.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 They will have a shape of godliness, but they will deny its power. Turn away from these people.
\v 6 For some of them are men who enter into households and captivate foolish women. These are women who are heaped up with sins and are led away by various desires.
\v 7 These women are always learning, but they are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **have a shape of godliness** - Paul speaks of godliness, the habit of honoring God, as if it were a physical object that had a shape.  AT: "appear godly" or "appear to honor God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they will deny its power** - Paul speaks of godliness as if it were a object that had physical power. Possible meanings are 1) "they will refuse to accept the power that God truly wants to give them" (UDB) or 2) "their lives will show no evidence of the godliness they say they have." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Turn away from** - Paul may be speaking of physically turning away from these people, but he wants his readers to do whatever they can to avoid them in general. AT: "Avoid these people"
  * **enter into households and captivate** - "enter into houses and greatly influence"
  * **foolish women** - "women who are spiritually weak." This can be because they fail to work at becoming godly or because they are idle and have many sins.
  * **who are heaped up with sins** - Paul speaks of the attraction of sin as if sin were heaped up on the backs of these women. Possible meanings are 1) "who sin often" or 2) "who feel terrible guilt because they continue to sin." The idea is that these men can easily influence these women because the women are unable to stop sinning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and are led away by various desires** - Paul speaks about these various desires as if they could lead another person away. This can be stated in active form. AT: "and they desire to sin in various ways rather than obey Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
