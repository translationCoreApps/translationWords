\v 21 The next king will be an evil man who is hated because he is not the son of the previous king, and he will not have the right to become king. But he will come in without any objection when people do not expect it, and he will become king by tricking the people.
\v 22 When his army advances, they will attack any armies that oppose him and their enemies will be swept away before them like a flood. Their enemies and the head of the priests will be swept away.

\v 20 Then someone will rise up in his place who will make a tax collector pass through for the sake of the splendor of the kingdom. But in the next days he will be broken, but not in anger or in battle.
\v 21 In his place will rise up a despised person to whom the people will not have given the honor of royal power; he will come unexpectedly and will take over the kingdom by trickery.
\v 22 An army will be swept away like a flood from before him. Both that army and the leader of the covenant will be destroyed.
