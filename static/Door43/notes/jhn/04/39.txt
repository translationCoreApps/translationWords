===== translationNotes: =====

  * **believed in him** - To "believe in" someone means to "trust in" that person. Here this also means that they believed he was the Son of God.
  * **He told me everything that I have done** - This is an exaggeration. The woman was very impressed with Jesus and felt that he must have known everything about her. AT: "He told me many things about my life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
