\v 1 I saw the Lamb open the first of the seven seals of the scroll. Then one of the four living creatures said in a voice as loud as thunder, "Come!"
\v 2 and a white horse appeared. There was someone riding it, and he had a bow and arrows. God gave him a wreath of leaves to wear on his head to show that he was to conquer evil. He went out to continue to do battle and to win.

\v 1 I looked when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice that sounded like thunder, "Come!"
\v 2 I looked and there was a white horse. Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown. He came out as a conqueror in order to conquer.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - John continues to describe the events that happened before the throne of God. The Lamb begins to open the seals on the scroll.

  * **Come!** - This is a command to one person, apparently the rider of the white horse who is spoken of in verse 2.
  * **he was given a crown** - This kind of crown was a likeness of wreaths of olive branches or laurel leaves, probably hammered out in gold. Examples actually made of leaves were given to victorious athletes to wear on their heads. This can be translated with an active verb. AT: "he received a crown" or "God gave him a crown (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a crown** - This was a wreath of olive branches or of laurel leaves like the wreaths that winning athletes received in contests at the time of John.
