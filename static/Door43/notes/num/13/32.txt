\v 33 We even saw the descendants of Nephili there. The descendants of Anak \add whom we saw there\add* are descended from the \add giant\add* Nephili people. When we saw them, we felt \add as small as\add* grasshoppers \f + \ft simile \f*, and they thought that we looked like grasshoppers too!"

\v 32 So those men gave to the Israelite people a bad report about the land that they had explored. They said, "The land that we explored destroys the life those who try to attack it. And all the people living there are very tall.
\v 33 We also saw giants there. They are the descendants of Anak (who come from the Nephilim, those giant people). When we saw these giants we felt as small as grasshoppers and they thought that we looked like grasshoppers too."

\v 32 So they spread around a discouraging report to the people of Israel about the land that they had examined. They said, "The land that we looked at is a land that eats up its inhabitants. All the people whom we saw there are people of great height.
\v 33 There we saw giants, descendants of Anak, people who came from giants. In our own sight we were like grasshoppers in comparison with them, and this is what we were in their sight, too."
