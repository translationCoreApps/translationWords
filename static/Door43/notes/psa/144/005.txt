===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Cause ... come down ... touch ... make ... Send ... scatter ... shoot ... drive** - These should probably be translated as requests, not commands, since the psalmist considers God greater than him.
  * **Cause the sky to sink** - Possible meanings are 1) tear the sky open or 2) bend the heavens like a tree branch bends when someone walks on it or as one bends a bow before shooting arrows.
  * **in confusion** - "so they do not know what to think or what to do"
