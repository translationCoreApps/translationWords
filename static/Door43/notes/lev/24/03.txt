===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - God continues giving Moses instructions about the things in the tent of meeting.

  * **Outside the curtain before the covenant decrees** - The phrase "covenant decrees" represents either the tablets that the decrees were written on or the box that the tablets were put in. These were kept in the very holy place, which was the room behind the curtain in the tent of meeting. AT: "Outside the curtain that is in front of the tablets of the covenant decrees" or "Outside the curtain that is in front of the box of the covenant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **curtain** - This was a thick fabric hung as a wall. It was not like a light window curtain.
  * **from evening to morning** - "from sunset to sunrise" or "all night"
  * **This will be a permanent statute throughout your people's generations** - This means that they and their descendants must obey this command forever. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:03:15|3:17]].
