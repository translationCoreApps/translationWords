<usfm>
\v 16 So I said this to the people in other nations,
\q2 and also announced it in Jerusalem,
\q1 "Yahweh says that an army is coming to Jerusalem from far away;
\q2 they will shout a battle cry against the cities of Judah.
\q1
\v 17 They will set up tents around Jerusalem like people set up temporary shelters around a field at harvest time.
\q2 That will happen because the people of Judah have rebelled against me.
\q1
\v 18 You will be punished very severely;
\q2 it will be as though a sword has stabbed your hearts.
\q1 But you are causing those things to happen to you
\q2 because of the evil things that you have done."


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Make the nations think about this: See, announce to Jerusalem that besiegers are coming from a distant land to shout in battle against the cities of Judah.
\v 17 They will be like the watchmen of a cultivated field against her all around, since she has been rebellious against me—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\v 18 and your conduct and your deeds have done these things to you. This will be your punishment. How terrible it will be! It will strike your very heart.
