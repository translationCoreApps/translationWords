\v 42 But if there is a reddish-white sore on his bald head or forehead, it is an infectious disease that has broken out.
\v 43 Then the priest must examine him to see if the swelling of the diseased area on his bald head or forehead is reddish-white, like the appearance of an infectious disease in the skin.
\v 44 If it is, then he has an infectious disease and he is unclean. The priest must surely pronounce him unclean because of his disease on his head.
