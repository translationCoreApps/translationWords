===== translationNotes: =====

  * **under their standard** - The "standards" were four larger groups that the tribes were divided into. Each standard was commanded to camp together. The standards was represented by a banner. See how you translated "standards" in [[:en:bible:notes:num:02:01|2:2]].
  * **Nahshon son of Amminadab** - Translate this man's name the same way that you did in [[:en:bible:notes:num:01:07|1:7]].
  * **74,600** - "seventy-four thousand and six hundred" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
