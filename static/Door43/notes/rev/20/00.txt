====== Revelation 20 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is about a period of time often referred to as the "millennial kingdom" because it is a kingdom of a thousand years. This chapter is very significant for understanding the events of the last days and the book of Revelation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lastday]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The thousand-year reign of Christ ==
Jesus is said to reign for a thousand years and all the prophecies in Scripture about worldwide peace will be fulfilled. Scholars are divided over whether this is an actual period of time or if it is an allegory for Christ beginning to reign in people's hearts. It is best to translate this as if Christ is physically reigning on earth for a thousand years and not attempt to input potential symbolism into the text. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

== Final rebellion ==
This chapter describes a period of time after Jesus' reign, known as the final rebellion. During this time, Satan and many people will attempt to rebel against Jesus. This will be God's ultimate and final victory over sin and evil before eternity begins. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]], [[:en:obe:kt:evil]] and [[:en:obe:kt:eternity]])

== Great white throne ==
This is an important judgment in heaven after the final rebellion. During this judgment, people who have faith in God are separated from those who reject him. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:judge]], [[:en:obe:kt:heaven]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Book of life ==
The is a metaphor for eternal life. Those possessing eternal life are said to have their names written in this book of life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Hades and the lake of fire ==
These appear to be two distinct places. The translator may wish to do further research to determine how to differentiate these two places, but they should not be equated with each other in translation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:hell]])
