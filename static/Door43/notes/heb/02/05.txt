===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The writer reminds these Hebrew believers that the earth will one day be under the rule of the Lord Jesus.
  * **General Information:** - The quotation here is from the book of Psalms in the Old Testament. It continues on through the next section.

  * **For it was not to the angels that God subjected** - "For God did not make the angels rulers over"
  * **the world to come** - Here "world" refers to the people who live there. And "to come" means that this is the world in the next age after Christ returns. AT: "the people who will live in the new world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **What is man, that you are mindful of him?** - This question is used to emphasize that humans are not important enough for God to pay attention them. AT: "No human being is worthy enough for you to think about him!" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Or a son of man, that you care for him?** - This means basically the same thing as the first question. This rhetorical question expresses surprise that humans are not important enough for God to care for them. AT: "No human is worthy enough for you to care for him!" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
