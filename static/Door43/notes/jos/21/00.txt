====== Joshua 21 General Notes ======


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

This chapter is about the allotment of land given to the tribe of Levi. Even though the did not receive an inheritance, they did receive small portions of land to live on and for their animals. It will be difficult to fully understand their location without a map. Further research may be needed to understand the location of their land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
