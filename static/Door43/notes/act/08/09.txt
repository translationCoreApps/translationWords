===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Simon is introduced to the story of Philip. Verses 9 to 11 are background information about Simon and who he was among the Samaritans. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

  * **But there was a certain man ... named Simon** - This is a way of introducing a new person into the story. Your language may use different wording to introduce a new person into the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **the city** - "the city in Samaria" (See: [[:en:bible:notes:act:08:04|8:5]])
  * **All the Samaritans** - This is an exaggeration. AT: "Many of the Samaritans in the city" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **from the least to the greatest** - These two phrases refer to everyone from one extreme to the other. AT: "no matter how important they were" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **This man is that power of God which is called Great** - People were saying that Simon was the divine power known as "The Great Power." 
  * **that power of God which is called Great** - Possible meanings are 1) the powerful representative of God or 2) God or 3) the most powerful man or 4) and angel. Since the term is unclear, it may be best to simply translate it as "the Great power of God" (UDB).
