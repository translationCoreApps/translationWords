\v 10 So they did not tell others about it \add for a long time\add*. But they discussed among themselves what it meant when he said that he would rise from the dead\f + \ft Or: become alive again \f* after he died.

\v 9 As they were coming down the mountain, he commanded them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead ones.
