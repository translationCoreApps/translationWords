  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **The one who is bent down** - This refers to the people of Israel who are slaves of the Babylonians. This phrase describes how they work. AT: "The slave" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the pit** - This refers to Sheol. AT: "the pit of Sheol" or "the grave" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **who churns up the sea** - This speaks of Yahweh causing the sea to move and the waves to rise and fall as if he were stirring the sea as one stirs the contents of a bowl with a large spoon. AT: "who causes the sea to churn" or "who makes the sea move up and down" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **its waves roar** - A roar is a powerful, loud sound made by something that is alive, such as a bear or lion. Here the waves are described as making this powerful sound. AT: "its waves crash loudly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
