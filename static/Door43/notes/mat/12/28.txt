\v 28 But because it is God's Spirit who enables me to drive out demons, that proves that the rule of God from heaven is already here.
\p
\v 29 I will show you why I am able to drive out demons. A person cannot go into the house of a strong man like Satan and carry off his possessions if he does not first tie up that strong man. But if he ties him up, then he will be able to take his possessions.
\p
\v 30 No one can be neutral. Those who do not acknowledge that the Holy Spirit enables me to expel demons are opposing me, and those who do not gather people to become my disciples are causing those people to go away from me.

<usfm>
\v 28 But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
\v 29 How can anyone enter the house of the strong man and steal his belongings without tying up the strong man first? Then he will steal his belongings from his house.
\v 30 The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to respond to the Pharisees.

  * **But if I** - Here "if" does not mean Jesus is questioning how he drives out demons. Here Jesus uses the word to introduce a true statement. AT: "But, because I" 
  * **then the kingdom of God has come upon you** - "then the kingdom of God has arrived among you." Here "kingdom" refers to God's rule as king. AT: "this means God is establishing his rule among you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **come upon you** - Here "you" is plural and refers to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **How can anyone enter the house ... belongings from his house** - Jesus uses a parable to continue his response to the Pharisees. Jesus means he can drive out demons because he is more powerful than Satan. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])
  * **How can anyone enter ... without tying up the strong man first?** - Jesus uses a question to teach the Pharisees and the crowd. AT: "No one can enter ... without tying up the strong man first" or "If a person wants to enter ... he must first tie up the strong man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **without tying up the strong man first** - "without taking control of the strong man first"
  * **Then he will steal** - "The he can steal" or "Then he will be able to steal"
  * **who is not with me** - "who does not support me" or "who does not work with me"
  * **is against me** - "opposes me" or "works against me"
  * **the one who does not gather with me scatters** - Jesus is using a metaphor that refers to a person either gathering the flock of sheep to a shepherd or making them scatter away from the shepherd. Jesus means that a person is either helping to make people become disciples of Jesus or he is making people reject Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
