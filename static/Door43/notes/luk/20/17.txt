===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues teaching the crowd.

  * **But Jesus looked at them** - "But Jesus stared at them" or "But he looked straight at them." He did this to hold them accountable to understand what he was saying. 
  * **What is the meaning of that which is written: 'The stone ... cornerstone'?** - Jesus uses a question to teach the crowd. AT: "You should be able to understand that which is written: 'The stone ... cornerstone.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **that which is written** - "this scripture"
  * **The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone** - This is the first of three metaphors in a prophecy from the book of Psalms. This one refers to the Messiah as if he were a stone that builders chose not to use, but that God made the most important stone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The stone that the builders rejected** - "The stone which the builders said was not good enough to use for building." In those days people built the walls of houses and other buildings out of stones. 
  * **the builders** - This refers to the religious rulers who are rejecting Jesus as Messiah. 
  * **the cornerstone** - "the chief stone of the building" or "the most important stone of the building"
  * **Every one who falls ... broken to pieces** - This second metaphor speaks of people who reject the Messiah as if they fall over a stone and are injured. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will be broken to pieces** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "will break up into pieces." This is a result of falling onto the stone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **But on whomever it falls** - "But whomever that stone falls on." This third metaphor speaks about the Messiah judging those who reject him as if he were a large stone that would crush them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
