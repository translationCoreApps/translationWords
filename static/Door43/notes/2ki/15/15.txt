\v 16 At that time Menahem completely destroyed the city of Tiphsah and killed all the people who lived there and in the surrounding territory from Tirzah on.

\v 15 As for the other matters concerning Shallum and the conspiracy that he formed, they are written in the book of the events of the kings of Israel.
\v 16 Then Menahem attacked Tiphsah and all who were there, and the borders around Tirzah, because they did not open up the city to him. So he attacked it, and he ripped open all the pregnant women in that village.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa Tiphsah \fqa* , one ancient version and some modern versions read,
\fqa Tappuah. \f*
