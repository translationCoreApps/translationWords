<usfm>
\q
\v 9 Surely men of low standing are vanity, and men of high standing are a lie;
\q they will weigh lightly in the scales;
\q weighed together, they are lighter than nothing.
\q
\v 10 Do not trust in oppression or robbery;
\q and do not hope uselessly in riches,
\q for they will bear no fruit; do not fix your heart on them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **men of low standing ... men of high standing are a lie** - This refers to men of all levels of wealth and importance. The phrases "are vanity" and "are a lie" have the same meaning. One cannot confidently trust in anyone.  AT: "You cannot place your trust in men, no matter how important they are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **weighed together, they are lighter than nothing** - If you put all of these kinds of men together on a scale, they would have no weight. This means that they have no real value to you. 
  * **oppression or robbery** - These two words have basically the same meaning. You cannot trust in money that you get by taking it from other people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **for they will bear no fruit** - The writer speaks of riches as if they were trees or vines that could bear fruit. AT: "for they will provide nothing good for you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **do not fix your heart on them** - Here "fix your heart" is an idiom that means to desire something greatly. AT: "do not desire them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
