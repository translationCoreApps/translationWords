===== translationNotes: =====


  * **that is baked in an oven ... that is cooked in a frying pan** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "that someone bakes in an oven ... that someone cooks in a frying pan" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **oven** - This was probably a hollow object made of clay. A fire was lit under the oven, and the heat would bake the dough inside of the oven. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:02:04|2:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **a frying pan** - This is a metal plate with rounded edges. The dough was placed in the pan and cooked over a fire. See how you translated "pan" in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:02:06|2:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **a baking pan** - This is a thick plate made of either clay or metal. The plate was placed over a fire, and the dough cooked on top of the plate. See how you translated "flat iron pan" in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:02:04|2:5]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
