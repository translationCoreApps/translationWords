<usfm>
\v 17 In the past you sinned in whatever way you wanted to sinâ€”you were slaves of sin. But then you began to sincerely obey what Christ taught you. I thank God for that.
\v 18 So now you do not have to sin any longer; sin is no longer your master. Instead, you are slaves of God, who is righteous.
