  * **will turn back** - "will retreat" or "will turn and run away"
  * **God is for me** - This means that God favors him. In this context it implies that God fights against the psalmist's enemies in order to protect him. AT: "God is fighting for me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **What can anyone do to me?** - Here a question is used to show that the psalmist is not afraid of people, because they cannot seriously harm him.
