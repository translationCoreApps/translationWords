===== translationNotes: =====

  * **that I may consume them** - Destroying them is spoken of as if God were to eat them. AT: "That I may destroy them" or "and I will destroy them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **lay facedown** - This shows that Moses and Aaron were humbling themselves before God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **the God of the spirits of all humanity** - Here "spirits" represents the ability to live. AT: "the God who gives life to all humanity" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **if one man sins, must you be angry with all the community?** - Moses and Aaron use this question to plead with God for the people. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "please do not be angry with all the community because one man sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
