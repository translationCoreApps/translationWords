\v 22 Jesus said to him, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, that is not your concern! You follow me."
\v 23 So the report circulated among the brothers and sisters that this disciple was not going to die. Yet Jesus did not say that he would not die. He said only, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, that is not your concern!"

\v 22 Jesus said to him, "If I want him to stay until I come, what is that to you? Follow me."
\v 23 So this statement spread among the brothers, that that disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to Peter that the other disciple would not die, but, "If I want him to stay until I come, what is that to you?"
