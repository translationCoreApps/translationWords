====== Jeremiah 05:7-9 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Yahweh says, "I cannot \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* forgive these people;
\q2 even their children have abandoned me.
\q1 When they solemnly declare something, they ask their gods \add to show that what they say is true\add*.
\q1 I gave my people everything that they needed,
\q2 but they often went to \add the shrines of their idols\add* and committed adultery there.
\q1
\v 8 Just like \f + \ft metaphor \f* well-fed male horses neigh, wanting sex with female horses,
\q2 each of the men desires to have sex with his neighbor's wife.
\q1
\v 9 Should I not punish them for this \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q2 I will certainly get revenge \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* on this nation whose people behave like that!
\b

\v 7 Yahweh says, "I cannot forgive these people;
\q2 even their children have abandoned me.
\q1 When they solemnly declare something, they ask their gods to show that what they say is true.
\q1 I gave my people everything that they needed,
\q2 but they often went to the high places on the hills, where they worshiped their idols and committed adultery there.
\q1
\v 8 Just like well fed male horses neigh, wanting to mate with female horses,
\q2 each of the men desires to sleep with his neighbor's wife.
\q1
\v 9 Should I not punish them for this?
\q2 I will certainly get revenge on this nation whose people behave like that!

<usfm>
\q
\v 7 Why should I pardon these people?
\q Your sons have abandoned me and have made oaths by what are not gods.
\q I fed them fully, but they committed adultery and took on the marks of a house of prostitution.
\q
\v 8 They were horses in heat. They roamed about wanting to mate. Each man neighed to his neighbor's wife.
\q
\v 9 So should I not punish them—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q and should I not avenge myself on a nation that is like this?
</usfm>
