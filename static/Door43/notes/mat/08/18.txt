===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here the scene shifts and tells about Jesus' response to some people who wanted to follow him.

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Matthew starts to tell a new part of the story.
  * **he gave instructions** - "he told his disciples"
  * **Then** - This means after Jesus "gave instructions" but before he could get into the boat.
  * **wherever** - "to any place"
  * **Foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests** - Jesus answers with this proverb. This means even wild animals have somewhere to rest. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]])
  * **Foxes** - Foxes are animals like dogs. They eat nesting birds and other small animals. If foxes are unknown in your area, use a general term for dog-like creatures or other furry animals. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **holes** - Foxes make holes in the ground to live in. Use the appropriate word for the place where the animal you use for "foxes" lives.
  * **the Son of Man** - Jesus is speaking about himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **nowhere to lay his head** - This refers to a place to sleep. AT: "no place of his own to sleep" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
