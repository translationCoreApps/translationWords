====== Nehemiah 05 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Equality ==

The rich made money from the poor. The rich oppressed the poor by charging interest on loans. Because Nehemiah wanted to treat everyone fairly, he did not collect any taxes from them. This chapter also emphasizes that it was wrong to enslave a fellow Jew. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:oppress]]) 

== Governor ==
Nehemiah was a governmental leader in Jerusalem, but he was not a king. Jerusalem had a great deal of independence but was under the authority of the Persian king. The term "governor" reflects this idea, but a different term may be used in translation.
