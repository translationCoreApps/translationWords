<usfm>
\v 16 Dan, although your tribe will be small,
\q their leaders will rule their people just like the leaders of other tribes of Israel will rule their people.
\q
\v 17 Your descendants will be like snakes at the side of a road,
\q like poisonous snakes lying beside a path.
\q They will strike the heels of horses that pass by,
\q causing the riders to fall backwards as the horses rear up on their hind legs."
\p
\v 18 Then Jacob prayed, "Yahweh, I am waiting for you to rescue me from my enemies."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Dan will judge his people** - Here "Dan" stands for his descendants. AT: "The descendants of Dan will judge their people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **his people** - Possible meanings for "his people" are 1) "the people of Dan" or 2) "the people of Israel"
  * **Dan will be a snake beside the road** - Jacob speaks about Dan and his descendants as if they were snakes. Though a snake is small, it can bring down a rider off his horse. So Dan, though a small tribe, is very dangerous to its enemies. AT: "The descendants of Dan will be like a snake beside the road" (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I wait for your salvation, Yahweh** - The abstract noun "salvation" can be translated as "save." AT: "I wait for you, Yahweh, to save me"
