===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here Matthew quotes the prophet Isaiah to show that Jesus' ministry fulfilled scripture.

  * **See** - "Look." God used this word to introduce a new person.
  * **my ... I** - All occurrences of these words refer to God. Isaiah is quoting what God said to him.
  * **in whom my soul is well pleased** - Here "soul" refers to the whole person. AT: "and I am very pleased with him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **and he will** - "and my servant will"
  * **announce judgment** - Here "judgment" does not mean "punishment." It means the servant will tell the Gentiles that God is just, and he will save them.
