===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Machpelah** - Machpela was the name of an area or region. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:23:07|23:9]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Mamre** - This was another name for the city of Hebron. It may have been named after Mamre, the friend of Abraham who lived there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **that is, the field, the cave that was in it, and all the trees** - This phrase explains what the author meant when he wrote "the field of Ephron." It was not only the field, but also the cave and trees in the field.
  * **passed to Abraham by purchase** - "became Abraham's possession when he purchased it" or "belonged to Abraham after he bought it"
  * **in the presence of the sons of Heth** - Here "presence" stands for the people serving as witnesses. AT: "with the people of Heth watching as witnesses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the sons of Heth** - Here "sons" stands for those who descended from Heth. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:23:03|23:3]]. AT: "the descendants of Heth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **all those who had come into the gate of his city** - This tells which sons of Heth saw Abraham buy the property. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:23:10|23:10]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])
  * **gate of his city** - The city gate was where the leaders of the city would meet to make important decisions.
  * **his city** - "the city where he lived." This phrase shows that Ephron belonged to that city. It does not mean that he owned it.
