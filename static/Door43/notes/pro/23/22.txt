===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These verses continue the "thirty sayings" ([[:en:bible:notes:pro:22:20|22:20]]).

  * **do not despise** - This can be stated positively.  "show respect for" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **Buy the truth, but do not sell it; buy wisdom, instruction, and understanding** - Another possible meaning is "Buy the truth, and do not sell wisdom, instruction, or understanding." The words "truth," "wisdom," "instruction," and "understanding" are abstract nouns that are spoken of as if they were physical items that a person can buy and sell in a market. They can be translated as verbs. AT: "Do what you need to do so you can know what is true, so you can be wise, so you can learn how to act, and so you can tell good from bad; never think of anything else as more important than these things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
