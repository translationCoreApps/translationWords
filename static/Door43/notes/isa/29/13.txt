\q1 They honor me by what they say \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
\q2 but they do not think [IDI] about what I \add desire\add*.
\q1 When they worship me,

\v 13 So the Lord says, "These people pretend to worship me.
\q1 They say good things to pretend to honor me,
\q2 but they do not think about what I desire.
\q1 When they worship me,
\q2 all they do is recite rules that people have made and that they have memorized.

\v 13 The Lord said, "This people comes close to me with their mouths 
\q1 and honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. 
\q1 Their honor for me is only a commandment of men that has been taught.
\q1
\v 14 Therefore, see, I will proceed to do a marvelous thing among this people, wonder after wonder. 
\q1 The wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will disappear."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This people comes close to me with their mouths and honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me** - The words "mouths" and "lips" refer to what people say. AT: "The people of Jerusalem honor me with what they say, but they do not honor me in their thoughts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Their honor for me is only a commandment of men that has been taught** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "They honor me only because that is what people tell them to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Therefore, see, I will proceed to do a marvelous thing among this people, wonder after wonder** - "Therefore, look and see! I am going to do something among you that you cannot explain"
  * **The wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will disappear** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **The wisdom of their wise men will perish** - "What the wise men say will no longer be wise"
  * **the understanding of their prudent men will disappear** - "the intelligence of the smart men no one will understand"
