===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The psalm shows Yahweh's power and glory. 

  * **The voice of Yahweh is heard over the waters** - God's voice is louder and clearer than all other sounds and noises. It can be heard over other loud sounds such as the sound of the waters. This can be stated in active form. AT: "When Yahweh speaks his voice is louder than the sound of the sea" or "Yahweh shouts louder than the sound of the waters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **over the waters** - This refers to the seas or the oceans. These waters make a very loud noise as the waves rise and fall.
  * **The voice of Yahweh** - All occurrences of "voice" here represent Yahweh speaking. The writer is emphasizing that when Yahweh speaks, the sound is so loud it is heard over the waters, and it is so powerful it can destroy the largest trees. AT: "When Yahweh speaks, his voice" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the God of glory thunders** - This speaks about God speaking as if it were the sound of thunder. Just like the sound of thunder, Yahweh's voice can be heard over large distances. AT: "The voice of the glorious God is loud like thunder" or "When the glorious God speaks it rumbles like thunder" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **over many waters** - "over the large bodies of water"
