  * **commotion** - "great noise and confusion"
  * **Withdraw your hand** - This seems to be an idiom the means "Stop what you are doing." Saul did not want Ahijah to continue to use the ark to ask God for direction. AT: "Do not bring the sacred chest at this time" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
