====== Daniel 04:10-12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 This is what I dreamed while I was lying on my bed: I saw a large tree \add growing\add* in the middle of the land.
\v 11 The tree was very strong and had grown very tall; \add it seemed that\add* its top reached up to the sky, with the result that everyone in the world \f + \ft hyperbole \f* could see it.
\v 12 It had beautiful leaves, and it had produced a lot of fruit for people to eat. Wild animals rested in the shade of that tree, and birds built nests in its branches. All the living creatures everywhere in the world got food from that tree.

\v 10 These were the sights that I saw in my mind as I lay upon my bed: I looked, and there was a tree in the middle of the earth, and its height was very great.
\v 11 The tree grew and became strong. Its top reached to the heavens, and it could be seen to the ends of the whole earth.
\v 12 Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit was abundant, and on it was food for all. The wild animals found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens lived in its branches. All living creatures were fed from it.
