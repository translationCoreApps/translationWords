====== 1 Timothy 05:21-22 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 I solemnly tell you that \add as you keep in mind that\add* God and Christ Jesus and the holy angels know everything that you do, obey these commands \add about elders\add*! \add As you consider what others say about an elder doing wrong\add*, do not easily\f + \ft Or: quickly \f* decide that what they say is true. And treat them all equally.
\p
\v 22 Do not be in a hurry to put your hands on a man \add to set him apart\f + \ft Or: to appoint him\add* \f* \add as an elder. Wait until you have examined him to see how he conducts his life\add*, because \add God will consider\add* that you are responsible if \add you approve\add* a person who sins, saying that he should \add become an elder\add*. Keep your life pure in every way.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 God, Jesus Christ, and the chosen angels see me as I solemnly command you to do these things. Be sure that you do not judge anyone before you should. Be sure that you do not favor one person over another when you lead the believers.

\p
\v 22 When you want someone to begin to serve the believers, make no decision too quickly, so you do not choose them too soon. And do not be a partner with anyone in sinning. You must keep yourself without fault.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 I solemnly command you before God and before Christ Jesus and their chosen angels, that you keep these commands without prejudice and that you do nothing out of favoritism.
\v 22 Place hands hastily on no one. Do not share in the sins of another person. You should keep yourself pure.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **their chosen angels** - This means the angels whom God and Jesus have chosen to serve them in a special way.
  * **you keep these commands without prejudice and that you do nothing out of favoritism** - The words "bias" and "favoritism" mean basically the same thing. Paul is emphasizing that Timothy must judge honestly and be fair to everyone. AT: "that you keep these rules without being partial or showing favor to anyone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **keep these commands** - Possible meanings are 1) this refers to the rules Paul just told Timothy or 2) this refers to the rules Paul is about to tell Timothy.
  * **Place hands** - This was a ceremony in which one or more church leaders would place their hands on people and pray that God would enable those people to serve the church in a way that would please God. Timothy was to wait until the person had shown good character for a long time before officially setting that person apart to serve the Christian community.
  * **Do not share in the sins of another person** - Paul speaks of someone's sin as if it were an object that could be shared with others. AT: "do not join in another person's sin" or "do not participate when another person sins"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do not share in the sins of another person** - Possible meanings are 1) if Timothy chose someone who was guilty of sin to be a church worker, God would hold Timothy responsible for that person's sin or 2) Timothy should not commit sins he saw others committing.
