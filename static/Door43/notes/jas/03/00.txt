====== James 03 General Notes ======


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
The author uses many different metaphors to convict his readers and to encourage them to display godliness in the way they speak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:godly]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Implicit information ==
The way a person speaks can be telling of their spiritual state. This is because it is an external behavior seen by other people. If a person is unable to control their actions when they are seen by others, they will not be able to control their actions when no one is looking. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
