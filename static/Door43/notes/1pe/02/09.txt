\v 9 But you are people whom God has chosen to belong to him. You are a group that worship God like priests, and you rule with God like kings. You are a people group that belongs to God, so that you might proclaim the wonderful things he has done. He has called you from your former ways, when you were ignorant of his truth, and he has made you understand the marvelous true things about him.
\v 10 What the scriptures say is true about you:
\q "Formerly, you were no people group at all,
\q But now you are God's people group.
\q At one time God had not acted mercifully toward you,
\q But now he has acted mercifully toward you."

  * **General Information:** - In verse 10 Peter quotes a verse from the prophet Hosea. Some modern versions do not format this as a quote, which is also acceptable.

  * **from darkness into his marvelous light** - Here "darkness" refers to their condition as sinful people who did not know God, and "light" refers to their condition as people who do know God and practice righteousness. AT: "from a life of sin and ignorance of God to a life of knowing and pleasing him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You did not receive mercy ... you have received mercy** - Here mercy, which is how God acts in kindness toward those who do not deserve it, is spoken of as if it were an object that one could receive in his hands. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
