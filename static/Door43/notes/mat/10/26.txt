\v 26 "Do not be afraid of those people. Everything that is unknown to people, God wants you now to reveal it. He does not want you to hide what is true, neither to keep it secret.
\v 27 So, instead of being afraid, what I say to you secretly as people do at night, tell it publicly as people do during the daytime. What I say to you privately as people do when they whisper to you, proclaim it publicly.

<usfm>
\v 26 Therefore do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be known.
\v 27 What I tell you in the darkness, say in the daylight, and what you hear softly in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about the persecution they will endure when they go out to preach.

  * **do not fear them** - Here "them" refers to the people who mistreat followers of Jesus.
  * **there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be known** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. Jesus is emphasizing that God will make all things known. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will reveal the things that people hide" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **What I tell you in the darkness, say in the daylight, and what you hear softly in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. Jesus is emphasizing that the disciples should tell everyone what he tells the disciples in private. AT: "Tell people in the daylight what I tell you in the darkness, and proclaim upon the housetops what you hear softly in your ear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **What I tell you in the darkness** - Here "darkness" means "in private." AT: "What I say to you secretly" or "The things I am telling you privately" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **say in the daylight** - Here "daylight" means "in public." AT: "say openly" or "say publicly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **what you hear softly in your ear** - This is a way of referring to whispering. AT: "what I whisper to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **proclaim upon the housetops** - Housetops where Jesus lived were flat, and people far away could hear anyone speaking with a loud voice. Here "housetops" refers to any place where all people can hear. AT: "speak loudly in a public place for all to hear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
