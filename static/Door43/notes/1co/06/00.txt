Christians should not take another christian to court before an non-Christian judge. It is better to be cheated. Since Christians will judge the angels, they should be able to solve problems among themselves. It is especially bad to use a court to cheat another believer. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:judge]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

The temple of the Holy Spirit is an important metaphor. It is a reference to the place where the Holy Spirit stays and is worshiped. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
