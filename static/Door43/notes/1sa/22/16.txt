\v 16 The king replied, "You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's house."
\v 17 The king said to the guard that stood around him, "Turn and kill the priests of Yahweh. Because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, but did not reveal it to me." But the servants of the king would not put out their hand to kill the priests of Yahweh.
