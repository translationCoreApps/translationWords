====== 1 Corinthians 02:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I do teach a message that people who are  \add spiritually\add* mature  \add consider to\add* be wise. But I do not teach a message that unbelievers  \add consider to be\add* wise. I also do not teach a message that unbelieving rulers in the world consider to be wise. \add What they think about it does not matter\add*, because  \add some day\add* they will Â…lose their power\f + \ft Or: not be ruling anymore \f*.
\v 7 Instead, I teach about what God planned wisely  \add long ago\add*. It is something that people did not know about previously because  \add God\add* did not reveal it previously. But God determined before he created the world that he would greatly benefit us by his wise plan.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Now it is to those who trust fully in Christ that we speak. You now have wisdom, and that wisdom has nothing to do with the kings and governors in this life, all of whom will soon pass away.
\v 7 No, we proclaim wisdom that God has kept hidden until now; that wisdom is the wise things God decided to do before he created the world, and he decided to do those things so that he and other beings would someday honor us.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 6 Now we do speak wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this world, or of the rulers of this age, who are passing away.
\v 7 Instead, we speak God's wisdom in hidden truth, the hidden wisdom that God predestined before the ages for our glory.
