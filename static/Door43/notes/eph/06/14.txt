\v 14 Stand firm as a soldier is on guard. Wear truth like the soldier fastens his belt around his waist; and as he puts on a breastplate, you put on your breastplate by doing what God has commanded you to do.
\v 15 Just as soldiers put on their boots, be ready to go anywhere you are needed for the sake of the gospel. You carry the gospel with you everwhere you go, and you bring peace with you everywhere.
\v 16 As the soldier takes up a shield for protection, so you take up the shield of faith, and that shield will put out the flaming darts that the evil one will shoot at you. Your shield will protect you.

<usfm>
\v 14 Stand, therefore, after you have put on the belt of truth and the breastplate of righteousness.
\v 15 Then as shoes for your feet, put on the readiness to proclaim the gospel of peace.
\v 16 In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, by which you will be able to put out all the flaming arrows of the evil one.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Stand, therefore** - The words "stand" represents successfully resisting or fighting something. See how you translated "stand firm" in [[:en:bible:notes:eph:06:12|6:13]]. "So resist evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the belt of truth** - Truth holds everything together for a believer just as a belt holds the clothing of a soldier together. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **truth ... righteousness** - We are to know the truth and act in ways that please God.
  * **the breastplate of righteousness** - Possible meanings are 1) the gift of righteousness covers a believer's heart just as a breastplate protects the chest of a soldier or 2) our living as God wants us, gives us a clear conscience that protects our hearts the way a breastplate protects a soldier's chest. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Then as shoes for your feet, put on the readiness to proclaim the gospel of peace** - Just as a soldier wears shoes to give him solid footing, the believer must have solid knowledge of the gospel of peace in order to be ready to proclaim it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **In all circumstances take up the shield of faith** - The believer must use the faith that God gives for protection when the devil attacks, just as a soldier uses a shield to protect him from enemy attacks. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the flaming arrows of the evil one** - The attacks of the devil against a believer are like flaming arrows shot at a soldier by an enemy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
