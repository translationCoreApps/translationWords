====== Jeremiah 16:12-13 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 But you \add who are living now\add* have done more wicked things than your ancestors did! Each of you stubbornly does the evil things that he desires and refuses to pay attention to what I say.
\v 13 So, I will throw you out of this land, and I will send you to a land that you and your ancestors have never known about. There you will worship other gods day and night. And I will not act mercifully toward you.'

<usfm>
\v 12 But you yourselves have brought about more wickedness than your ancestors, for see, each person is walking by the stubbornness of his wicked heart; there is no one who listens to me.
\v 13 So I will throw you from this land to a land that you have not known, neither you nor your ancestors, and you will worship other gods there by day and night, for I will not give any favor to you.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **see** - "Indeed." The word "see" here adds emphasis to what follows.
  * **walking by the stubbornness of his wicked heart** - Yahweh speaks of a person's actions as if the person were walking along a path. Here the word "heart" represents the mind or will. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:11:06|11:8]]. AT: "stubbornly doing the wicked things that he wants to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **who listens to me** - "who does what I tell him to do"
  * **throw you from this land** - Yahweh speaks of forcefully removing the people from the land as if he were throwing them from the land. AT: "force you to leave this land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **by day and night** - By mentioning both "day" and "night" this phrase refers to any time in general. AT: "all the time" or "continually" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
