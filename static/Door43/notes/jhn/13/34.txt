===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues speaking to his disciples.
 
  * **love** - This is the kind of love that comes from God and focuses on the good of others, even when it does not benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do. 
  * **everyone** - This is an exaggeration that adds emphasis to Jesus' statement. It refers to those people who see the disciples' love for each other. AT: "Everyone who is aware of your love for one another" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
