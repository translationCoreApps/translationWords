\v 14 You must not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he is of your fellow Israelites, or of the foreigners who are in your land within your city gates;
\v 15 Each day you must give him his wage; the sun must not go down on this unsettled matter, for he is poor and is counting on it. Do this so that he does not cry out against you to Yahweh, and so that it not be a sin that you have committed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **You must not oppress a hired servant** - "You must not treat a hired servant poorly"
  * **hired servant** - a person who gets paid daily for his work
  * **poor and needy** - These two words have similar meanings and emphasize that this is a person who cannot help himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **within your city gates** - Here "city gates" mean towns or cities. AT: "in one of your cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Each day you must give him his wage** - "You should give the man the money he earns every single day"
  * **the sun must not go down on this unsettled matter** - This is an idiom. The Israelites considered the new day as starting when the sun went down. AT: "you should pay the man on the same day he does the work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **for he is poor and is counting on it** - The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "because he is poor and depends on his wages to buy his food for the next day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **he does not cry out against you to Yahweh** - "he does not call out to Yahweh and ask him to punish you"
