====== 2 Corinthians 12:11-13 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 It has been foolish for me \add to talk about myself like this\add*, but it is you who forced me to do it. Truly \add if the Lord would not help me\add*, I would be worthless, \add as my opponents say that I am\add*. But none of the men whom you \add wrongfully think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* are great apostles are greater in any way than I am. So it would have been right\f + \ft Or: proper \f* for you to say good things about me.
\v 12 \add You should have done that, because\add* when I was with you \add I\add* repeatedly did the things that showed you that \add I am truly\add* an apostle, such as performing many \f + \ft doublet \f* miracles.
\v 13 And I have \add certainly treated\add* you as well as \add I treated\add* the other congregations \add that I helped to start. Or do you think that\add* by not asking you \add to pay me for my work\add*, I was not treating you as well as I treated the other congregations? It is foolish for you to\add think that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add it\add* was wrong for me not \add to ask for pay from you for my work, and therefore I should ask\add* you to forgive me for that!\f + \ft Or: Do you \add think that it\add* was wrong for me not \add to ask for pay from you for my work, and therefore I should ask\add* you to forgive me for that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 11 When I write this way, I am praising myself. But I had to do so, because you should have had confidence in me. I am just as good as these "super-apostles," even though I am really nothing at all.
\v 12 I gave you the true signs of being an authentic apostleâ€”miracles that I did very patiently among you: wonderful miracles that proved that I truly serve Jesus Christ.
\v 13 You certainly were just as important as all the other churches! The only way you were different was that I received no money from you as I did from them. Forgive me that I did not ask this from you!

\p
\v 11 I have become a fool! You forced me to this, for I should have been praised by you. For I was not at all inferior to the so-called super-apostles, even though I am nothing.
\v 12 The true signs of an apostle were performed among you with complete patience, signs and wonders and mighty deeds.
\v 13 For how were you less important than the rest of the churches, except that I was not a burden to you? Forgive me for this wrong!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul reminds the believers in Corinth of the true signs of an apostle and of his humility before them to strengthen them.

  * **I have become a fool** - "I am acting like a fool"
  * **You forced me to this** - "You forced me to talk this way"
  * **I should have been praised by you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "it is praise that you should have given me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **praised** - Possible meanings are 1) "praise" ([[:en:bible:notes:2co:03:01|03:1]]) or 2) "recommend" ([[:en:bible:notes:2co:04:01|04:2]]).
  * **For I was not at all inferior to** - By using the negative form, Paul is saying strongly that those Corinthians who think that he is inferior are wrong. AT: "For I am just as good as" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes|Litotes]])
  * **super-apostles** - Paul uses irony here to show that they are less important then they claim to be. AT: "those teachers whom some think are better than anyone else." See how this is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:2co:11:05|11:05]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **The true signs of an apostle were performed** - This can be stated in active form, with emphasis on the "signs." AT: "It is the true signs of an apostle that I performed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **signs ... signs** - Use the same word both times.
  * **signs and wonders and mighty deeds** - These are the "true signs of an apostle" that Paul performed "with complete patience."
  * **how were you less important than the rest of the churches, except that ... you?** - Paul is emphasizing that the Corinthians are wrong to accuse him of wanting to do them harm. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "I treated you the same way I treated all the other churches, except that ... you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **I was not a burden to you** - "I did not ask you for money or other things I needed"
  * **Forgive me for this wrong!** - Paul is being ironic to shame the Corinthians. Both he and they know that he has done them no wrong, but they have been treating him as though he has wronged them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony|Irony]])
  * **this wrong** - not asking them for money and other things he needed
