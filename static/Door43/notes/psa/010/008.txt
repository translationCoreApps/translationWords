\q1
\v 9 They are like \f + \ft metaphor \f* lions that crouch down and hide,

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 He makes plans to attack the people living in the villages, people who have done nothing wrong.
\q2 He waits in places where he can hide 
\q2 while he keeps looking for more people he can attack, 
\q2 people who cannot defend themselves.
\q1
\v 9 He waits for his victims like a lion who crouches down, 
\q2 and just like the lion, he hides in the bushes.
\q2 He is like the hunter who spreads out the net 
\q2 so he can catch helpless people and drag them away.
\b
\q1
\v 10 The helpless people are crushed by the wicked person's plans 
\q2 and all the things he does. 
\q2 He is powerful, and when he opposes the helpless people, 
\q2 he always takes away from them whatever he wants. 


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 He waits in ambush near the villages;
\q in the secret places he murders the innocent;
\q his eyes look for some helpless victim.
\q
\v 9 He lurks in secret like a lion in the thicket;
\q he lies in wait to catch the oppressed.
\q He catches the oppressed when he pulls in his net.
\q
\v 10 His victims are crushed and beaten down;
\q they fall into his strong nets.
