\v 12 Although doing wicked things was like having sweet food in their mouths
\q2 that they wanted to continue tasting,
\q1
\v 13 and although they did not want to stop doing those things,
\q1
\v 14 those evil things will someday become like poison that they swallow,
\q2 or like the poison from snakes.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 12 Although wickedness is sweet in his mouth,
\q although he hides it under his tongue,
\q
\v 13 although he holds it there and does not let it go
\q but keeps it still in his mouthâ€”
\q
\v 14 the food in his intestines turns bitter;
\q it becomes the poison of asps inside him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Zophar continues speaking to Job.

  * **Although wickedness is sweet in his mouth** - Here "wickedness is sweet" represents a person enjoying doing wicked things. AT: "Although doing wicked things is pleasurable like tasting sweet food in the mouth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **although he hides ... does not let it go** - This represents wanting to continue to enjoy the wickedness as one wants to continue enjoying tasty food by keeping it in the mouth.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the food in his intestines turns bitter** - When food turns bitter in the stomach, it causes pain and a bitter taste. This is a metaphor for a person experiencing the painful consequences of doing wicked things. AT: "those wicked things become like food that has turned bitter in the stomach" or "the consequences of those wicked things are painful like food that becomes sour in the stomach" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **it becomes the poison of asps inside him** - This image is even worse than sour food in the stomach. This is a metaphor for a person experiencing the terrible consequences of doing wicked things. AT: "the consequences of doing those wicked things are painful like the poison of asps inside him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **asps** - "poisonous snakes"
