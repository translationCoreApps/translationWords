====== Hebrews 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is about how Jesus is superior to the angels.

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:5, 7-13, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

== "Our ancestors" ==
This letter begins with an assumption of a Jewish audience. This is why it is called "Hebrews." 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical questions ==
The author uses rhetorical questions as a way of proving Jesus is better than the angels. 

== Poetry ==
The author uses many poetic elements in his letter. This is not typical of a letter and causes his teachings concerning the person of Christ to stand out. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Prophecy ==
Jesus literally fulfilled these prophecies about the Messiah even though the prophecies often contained poetic or metaphorical language. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:christ]] and [[:en:ta::vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
