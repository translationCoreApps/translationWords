===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues telling the people what Yahweh wants them to do.

  * **will have no portion nor inheritance with Israel** - The Levites not receiving any land from Yahweh is spoken of as if they would not receive an inheritance. AT: "will not possess any of the people's land" or "will not receive any of the land that the Israelites will possess" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **no portion** - "no part" or "no share"
  * **among their brothers** - "among the other tribes of Israel" or "among the other Israelites"
  * **Yahweh is their inheritance** - Moses speaks of the great honor that Aaron and his descendants will have by serving Yahweh as priests as if Yahweh were something that they will inherit. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:10:08|10:9]]. AT: "instead, they will have Yahweh" or "instead, Yahweh will allow them to serve him and he will provide for them through that service" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
