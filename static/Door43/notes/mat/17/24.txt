\v 24 When Jesus and the disciples came to the city of Capernaum, the men who collected taxes for the temple approached Peter and said to him, "Your teacher pays the temple tax, does he not?"
\v 25 He answered them, "Yes, he does pay it." When the disciples came into Jesus' house, before Peter began to speak, Jesus said to him, "Simon, from whom do you think rulers collect revenue or taxes? Do they collect taxes from the citizens of their own country, or from citizens of countries they have conquered?"

\v 24 When they had come to Capernaum, the men who collected the half-shekel tax came to Peter and said, "Does not your teacher pay the half-shekel tax?"
\v 25 He said, "Yes." But when Peter went into the house, Jesus spoke to him first and said, "What do you think, Simon? The kings on earth, from whom do they receive tax or tribute? From their subjects or from foreigners?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here the scene shifts again to a later time when Jesus teaches Peter about paying the temple tax.

  * **When they** - "When Jesus and his disciples"
  * **the half-shekel tax** - This was a tax that Jewish men paid to support the temple in Jerusalem. AT: "the temple tax" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the house** - "the place where Jesus was staying"
  * **What do you think, Simon? The kings on earth, from whom do they receive tax or tribute? From their subjects or from foreigners?** - Jesus asks these questions to teach Simon, not to gain information for himself. AT: "Listen, Simon. We know that when kings collect taxes, they collect it from foreigners rather than their own citizens" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **kings on earth** - This refers to leaders in general.
