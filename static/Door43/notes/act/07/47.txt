\v 47 But instead, God told David's son Solomon to build a house where people could worship him."

\v 48 "However, we know that God is greater than everything, and he does not live in houses that people have made. It is like the prophet Isaiah wrote: 
\q
\v 49-50 God said, "Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool. I myself have made everything both in heaven and on the earth. So you human beings cannot make a place good enough for me to live in!"

\v 47 But Solomon built God a house.
\v 48 However, the Most High does not live in houses made with hands; it is like the prophet says,
\q
\v 49 'Heaven is my throne,
\q and the earth the footstool for my feet.
\q What kind of house can you build me? says the Lord:
\q or where is the place for my rest?
\q
\v 50 Did not my hand make all these things?'

  * **General Information:** - In verses 49 and 50, Stephen quotes from the prophet Isaiah. In the quotation, God is speaking about himself.

  * **made with hands** - "made by people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Heaven is my throne ... earth the footstool for my feet** - The prophet is comparing the greatness of God's presence to how impossible it is for man to build a place for God to rest on earth since the whole earth is nothing but a place for God to rest his feet.
  * **What kind of house can you build me?** - God asks this question to show how useless man's efforts are to take care of God. AT: "You can not build a house adequate enough for me!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **where is the place for my rest?** - God asks this question to show man that he cannot provide God any rest. AT: "There is no place of rest good enough for me!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
