\v 23 When you come into the land and have planted all kinds of trees for food, then you must regard the fruit they produce as forbidden to be eaten. The fruit must be forbidden to you for three years. It must not be eaten.
\v 24 But in the fourth year all the fruit will be holy, an offering of praise to Yahweh.
\v 25 In the fifth you may eat the fruit, having waited so that the trees might produce more. I am Yahweh your God.
