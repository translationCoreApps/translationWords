\v 7 It will be terrible for those \f + \ft metonymy \f* who cause others to stop believing in me. \add God will punish them eternally\add*. It is inevitable that there will be \add those who\add* cause others to stop believing in me. But it will be horrible for everyone who does that.
\v 8 So, if you \add are wanting to use\add* one of your hands or feet to sin, \add stop using that hand or foot! Even if you have to\add* cut it off \add to avoid sinning, do it\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*! It is good\add that you not sin and\add* go where you will live \add with God eternally, even though while you are still here on earth\add* you are maimed or lame and do not have a hand or a foot. But it is not good that you continue to have your two hands and two feet \add and do\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add the sinful things you want to, and as a result\add*, you are thrown into \add hell\add*, where there is eternal fire burning.

\v 7 How terrible it will be for those who cause others to sin. There will always be temptations to sin, but how terrible it will be for anyone to cause another person to sin.
\v 8 So if you are wanting to use one of your hands or feet to sin, stop using that hand or foot! Even if you have to cut it off so you will not sin! Suppose you had only one hand or one foot and still lived forever with God, how much better is that than if you had both hands and both feet and God threw you into the eternal fire in hell because of your sin.

\v 7 Woe to the world because of times of stumbling! For it is necessary that those times come, but woe to the person through whom those times come!
\v 8 If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to be thrown into the eternal fire having two hands or two feet.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to use a little child to teach the disciples and warns against the terrible consequences of causing children to sin.

  * **to the world** - Here "world" refers to people. AT: "to the people of the world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **because of times of stumbling** - Here "stumbling" is a metaphor for sin. AT: "because of the things that cause people to sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **that those times come** - "that those things come that cause people to sin"
  * **the person through whom those times come** - "any person who causes others to sin"
  * **If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you** - Jesus uses a hyperbole here to emphasize how serious he is. Jesus means a person must do anything necessary to remove from their lives what causes them to sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **your ... you** - All occurrences of these words are singular. Jesus is speaking to all people in general. It may be more natural for your language to translate with a plural "you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **into life** - "into eternal life"
  * **than to be thrown into the eternal fire having two hands or two feet** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "than to have both hands and feet when God throws you into the eternal fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
