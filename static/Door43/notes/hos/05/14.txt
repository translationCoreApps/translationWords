<usfm>
\v 14 I will become like a lion to the people of Ephraim in Israel;
\q2 I will become like a young lion to the people of Judah.
\q1 I will destroy them and leave them;
\q1 I will carry them far away,
\q2 and no one will be able to rescue them.
\q1
\v 15 Then I will go back to where I came from;
\q2 from there I will wait for them to admit that they have sinned;
\q1 I will wait for them to come and ask me to help them."

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 So I will be like a lion to Ephraim,
\q and like a young lion to the house of Judah.
\q I, even I, will tear and go away;
\q I will carry them off,
\q and there will be no one to rescue them.
\q
\v 15 I will go and return to my place,
\q until they acknowledge their guilt and seek my face,
\q until they earnestly seek me in their distress."
