\v 52 The Jews who had listened to Jesus were now angrily arguing among themselves. They could not understand how anyone could promise that others would eat his own body.
\v 53 So Jesus confronted them with difficult words: "I am telling you the truth: Unless you eat the flesh of me, the Son of Man, and drink my blood, you will never live forever.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Some Jews who are present begin to argue among themselves and Jesus responds to their question.

  * **How can this man give us his flesh to eat?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to emphasize that the Jewish leaders are reacting negatively to what Jesus has said about "his flesh." AT: "There is no way that this man can give us his flesh to eat!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **Truly, truly** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:01:49|1:51]].
  * **eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood** - Here the phrases "eat the flesh" and "drink his blood" are metaphors that show how trusting in Jesus, the Son of Man, is like receiving spiritual food and drink. AT: "receive the Son of Man just like you receive food and drink" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you will not have life in yourselves** - "you will not receive eternal life"
