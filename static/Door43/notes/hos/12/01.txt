===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Hosea the prophet is speaking.

  * **Ephraim feeds on the wind** - The wind, symbol of all that is useless and impermanent, is spoken of as if it were food that the people of the northern kingdom could eat. However, other modern versions interpret this passage in various ways: "Ephraim is a friend of the wind" or "Ephraim tries to shepherd the wind." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and follows after the east wind** - The east wind was very hot and destructive. Attempting to benefit from the east wind is spoken of as following after it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **carry olive oil to Egypt** - The people of Israel sent olive oil as a present to the king of Egypt to try and persuade him to help them.
  * **lawsuit** - A lawsuit is a complaint in a court of law against a person in which compensation is asked for. Here "lawsuit" represents the accusations of unfaithfulness that Yahweh brings against his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
