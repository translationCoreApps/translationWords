<usfm>
\v 13 I also saw that night someone coming who resembled a son of man, that is, he had a human figure. He was coming close, surrounded by clouds, and he came to The One who Lives Forever and was presented to him in honor.
\v 14 He was given authority to rule over all the nations in the world; royal honor was given to him. He will rule foreverâ€”he will never stop ruling. The kingdom that he rules will never be destroyed.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 13 In my visions that night,
\q I saw one coming with the clouds of heaven like a son of man;
\q he came to the Ancient of Days
\q and was presented before him.
\q
\v 14 Authority to rule and glory and royal power were given to him
\q so that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him.
\q His authority to rule is an everlasting authority that will not pass away,
\q and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Most of the text of verses 9-14 is symbolic language with parallel lines that have similar meaning. For this reason, the ULB and UDB present them in poetic form. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **I saw one coming ... like a son of man** - The person that Daniel saw was not a normal man, but had a human figure like a man. "I also saw that night someone coming who resembled a son of man, that is, he had a human figure" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **with the clouds of heaven** - "with the clouds of the sky"
  * **the Ancient of Days** - This refers to God who is eternal. See how you translated this title in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:07:09|7:9]]
  * **was presented before him** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "they presented this son of man to the Ancient of Days" or "he stood before him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Authority to rule and glory and royal power were given to him** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The one who looked like a son of man received authority to rule, glory, and royal power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **royal power** - This, here, refers to "authority."
  * **peoples, nations, and languages** - Here "nations" and "languages" represent people from different nations who speak different languages. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:03:03|3:4]]. AT: "people from different nations and who speak different languages" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **will not pass away ... will never be destroyed** - These two phrases mean the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **that will never be destroyed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that no one will ever destroy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
