\v 1 Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars here for me and prepare seven bulls and seven rams."
\v 2 So Balak did as Balaam requested. Then Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on every altar.
\v 3 Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stand at your burnt offering and I will go. Perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you." So he went away to a hilltop with no trees.
