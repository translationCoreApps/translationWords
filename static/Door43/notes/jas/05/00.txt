====== James 05 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Eternity ==
This chapter contrasts living for things of this world, which will not last, with living for things that will last for eternity. It is also important to live with the expectation that Jesus will return soon. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:eternity]])

== Oaths ==
Scholars are divided over whether this passage teaches all oaths are wrong. Most scholars believe some oaths are permissible and James instead is teaching Christians to have integrity.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Elijah ==
This story will be difficult to understand if the books of Kings and Chronicles have not yet been translated. 

== "Save his soul from death" ==
This probably teaches that the person who stops their sinful lifestyle will not be punished with physical death as a consequence of their sin. On the other hand, some scholars believe this passage teaches about eternal salvation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]], [[:en:obe:kt:death]] and [[:en:obe:kt:save]])
