===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - God continues to speak to Ezekiel

  * **son of man** - "son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "mortal person" or "human"
  * **briers and thorns and ... scorpions** - These words describe the people of Israel who will not treat Ezekiel kindly when he tells them what God says. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **briers and thorns** - Briers are bushes with sharp points on the branches. The sharp points on the branches are called thorns.
  * **scorpions** - A scorpion is an small animal with two front claws, six legs, and a large tail with a poisonous stinger. Its sting is very painful.
  * **Do not fear their words** - "Do not be afraid of what they say."
  * **be dismayed by their faces** - The words "their faces" are a metonym for the message the people express with their faces. AT: "lose your desire to serve me because of the way they look at you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
