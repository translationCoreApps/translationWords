\v 20 Sometimes the cloud remained a few days on the tabernacle. In that case, they would obey Yahweh's commandâ€”they would make camp and then travel on again at his command.
\v 21 Sometimes the cloud was present in camp from evening until morning. When the cloud lifted in the morning, they journeyed. If it continued for a day and for a night, only when the cloud lifted would they journey on.
