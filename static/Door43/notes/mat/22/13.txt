===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus concludes his parable about a marriage feast.

  * **Bind this man hand and foot** - "Tie him up so that he cannot move his hands or feet"
  * **into the outer darkness** - This expression refers to the eternal destiny of those who reject God. AT: "the dark place away from God." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:11|8:12]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **weeping and the grinding of teeth** - This represents extreme sadness and suffering. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:11|8:12]].
  * **For many people are called, but few are chosen** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "For God invites many people, but he only chooses a few" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For** - This marks a transition. Jesus has ended the parable and will now explain the point of the parable.
