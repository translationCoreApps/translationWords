\v 25 Near the cross where \add they had nailed\add* Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the \add wife\add* of Clopas, and \add another\add* Mary, the woman from Magdala \add village\add*.
\v 26 Jesus saw his mother standing there. He also saw me standing nearby. Then he said to his mother, "This man \add will now be like\add* your son."
\v 27 And he said to me, "\add Treat this\add* woman as \f + \ft metaphor \f* your mother." So from that time I took her to my home \add and took care of her\add*.

\v 25 The soldiers did those things. 
\p Jesus' mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene were all standing near his cross.
\v 26 When Jesus saw his mother standing there and John, the disciple whom he especially loved, standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Mother, here is the one who will act like a son to you."
\v 27 And he said to the disciple, "Here is your mother!" So from that very moment, that disciple took her to live in his home.
