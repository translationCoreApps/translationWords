====== Mark 11 General Notes ======


=== Structure and Format ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 11:9-10, 17, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Colt ==

The way in which Jesus entered into Jerusalem, seated on an animal, was similar to the way a king would have entered into a city after a great victory. It was traditional for the kings of Israel to ride on a donkey. There was also a donkey present with the colt but it is unclear which animal Jesus rode. It is best to translate this as it appears in the ULB without trying to reconcile these two passages. (See:[[:en:bible:notes:mat:21:01|Matthew 21:1-7]])
