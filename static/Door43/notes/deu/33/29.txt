===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh ... majesty?** - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. It can also be stated in active form. AT: "There is no other people group like you, a people whom Yahweh has saved ... majesty." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the shield ... the sword** - This merism speaks of Yahweh defending the Israelites from their enemies and enabling them to attack their enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]]) 
  * **the shield of your help** - The word "shield" is a metaphor for Yahweh protecting and defending the Israelites. The abstract noun "help" can be translated as a verb. AT: "the one who protects you and helps you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the sword of your majesty** - The word "sword" is a metaphor for the power to kill with the sword, that is, to win battles. AT: "the one who enables you to win battles and so have majesty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
