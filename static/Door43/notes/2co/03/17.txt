===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Now the word "Lord" here means "the Spirit." Where the Spirit of the Lord is, people become free.
\v 18 But for all of us who believe, we look at him with no veil over our faces, and we reflect his brilliant light more and more. This is what the Lord does; and he is the Spirit.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Now the Lord is the Spirit. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
\v 18 Now all of us, with unveiled faces, see the glory of the Lord. We are being transformed into the same glorious likeness from one degree of glory into another, just as from the Lord, who is the Spirit.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now all of us** - Here the word "us" refers to all believers, including Paul and the Corinthians. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **with unveiled faces, see the glory of the Lord** - Unlike the Israelites who could not see God's glory reflected on Moses' face because he had covered it with a veil, there is nothing to prevent believers from seeing and understanding God's glory. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **We are being transformed into the same glorious likeness** - The Spirit is changing believers to be glorious like him. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The Lord is transforming us into his same glorious likeness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from one degree of glory into another** - "from one amount of glory to another amount of glory." This means that the Spirit is constantly increasing the glory of believers.
  * **just as from the Lord** - "just as this comes from the Lord"
