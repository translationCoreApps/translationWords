===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The Lord continues to describe the army of Assyria as a river that will flood Judah. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:08:05|8:7]])

  * **The River will sweep onward into Judah, flooding and passing on, until it reaches to your neck** - The army of Assyria is like a flood of water. AT: "More and more soldiers will come like a river rising up to your neck" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The River** - the Euphrates River in Assyria. This is a metonym for the Assyrian soldiers, who will come from their homes by the Euphrates River ([[:en:bible:notes:isa:08:05|8:7]]). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Its outstretched wings will fill** - Possible meanings are 1) as "the River" in the metaphor rises, its "wings" flow over and cover what had been dry land or 2) Isaiah changes metaphors and now speaks of Yahweh as a bird who is protecting the land, "But his outstretched wings will cover." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Immanuel** - Translators may add a footnote that says: "The name Immanuel means 'God with us.'" Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:07:13|7:14]].
