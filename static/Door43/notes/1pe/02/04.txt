\v 4 Come to the Lord Jesus. He is like the most important stone in the foundation of a building, but he is living, not lifeless like a stone. Many people rejected him, but God chose him and considers him to be very valuable.
\v 5 And like men build houses with stones, God is joining you together like a building in which his Spirit lives. He is doing this in order that youâ€”like the priests who offer sacrifices at the altar, might do things that please God because Jesus Christ has died for you.

\v 4 Come to him who is a living stone that has been rejected by people, but that has been chosen by God as valuable to him.
\v 5 You also are like living stones that are being built up to be a spiritual house, in order to be a holy priesthood that offers the spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
