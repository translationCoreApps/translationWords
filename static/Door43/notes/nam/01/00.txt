====== Nahum 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:2-15, which is poetic prophecy. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

Despite being divided into three chapters, this book consists of one long prophecy. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Yahweh's anger on Nineveh ==
This prophecy should be read alongside of the book of Jonah. The evil of the Ninevites will be punished by God, only after he uses them for his own purposes. These actions of Yahweh, although described as vengeance or anger, do not have the same connotations as they do with humans. Therefore, Yahweh is not sinful. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:evil]], [[:en:obe:kt:avenge]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

== Complete destruction ==
At this time, Assyria controlled almost the entire Near East. Nahum prophesies that they will be completely destroyed as a nation so that they will not even be a people group any longer. This prophecy came true and did so very suddenly.
