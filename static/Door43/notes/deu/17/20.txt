===== translationNotes: =====

  * **so that his heart is not lifted up above his brothers** - Here "his heart" refers to the whole person. A king becoming arrogant is spoken of as if his heart were lifted up. AT: "so that he does not become arrogant" or "so that he does not think he is better than his fellow Israelites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so that he does not turn away from the commandments, to the right hand or to the left** - A king disobeying God's commands is spoken of as if a person were to turn off the correct path. AT: "so that he does not disobey any of the commandments" This can be stated in positive form. AT: "so that he obeys all of the commandments" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **prolong his days** - Long days is a metaphor for a long life. See how you translated a similar phrase "prolong your days" in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:04:25|4:26]]. AT: "be able to live a long time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
