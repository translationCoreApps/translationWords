====== Jeremiah 44:4-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Many times I sent my prophets who served me, to say to them, 'Do not do those abominable things that I hate!'
\v 5 But my people would not pay any attention \f + \ft doublet \f* to what I said to them. They would not turn away from their wicked behavior, or stop burning incense to \add worship\f + \ft Or: honor \f*\add* other gods.
\v 6 So I poured out my punishment \f + \ft metonymy \f* on them. My punishment fell on the streets of Jerusalem and on the other towns in Judah. It caused those towns to be ruined and deserted, and they are still like that.

\v 5 But my people would not pay any attention to what I said to them. They would not turn away from their wicked behavior, or stop burning incense to worship other gods.
\v 6 So I poured out the consequences of my great anger on them. My punishment fell on the streets of Jerusalem and on the other towns in Judah like a fire. It caused those towns to be ruined and deserted, and they are still like that.

\v 4 So I repeatedly sent all of my servants the prophets to them. I sent them to say, 'Stop doing these abominable things that I hate.'
\v 5 But they did not listen. They refused to pay attention or turn from their wickedness in burning incense to other gods.
\v 6 So my fury and my wrath were poured out and kindled a fire in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. So they became ruins and devastations, as at this present day."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **So I repeatedly sent** - The word "I" refers to Yahweh.
  * **my fury and my wrath were poured out** - This describes Yahweh's punishment as something that he can hold back like water in a container but then pour out when his anger causes him to begin his punishment on those who anger him. AT: "I poured out my fury and my wrath." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **my fury and my wrath** - The words "fury" and "wrath" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the intensity of his wrath. AT: "my terrible wrath." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **they became ruins and devastations** - The words "ruins" and "devastations" mean basically the same thing. Together they emphasize the complete devastation of Judah and Jerusalem. AT: "they became completely devastated." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
