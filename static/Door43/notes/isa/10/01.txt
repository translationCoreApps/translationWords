===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to those who enact unjust laws and write unfair decrees** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. AT: "to those who make laws and decrees that are not fair to everyone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **the needy** - "poor people" 
  * **plunder widows** - "take everything from the women whose husbands have died"
  * **and make the fatherless their prey** - Isaiah compares orphans to animals that other animals hunt and eat. This emphasizes that orphans are powerless and judges can easily harm them.
