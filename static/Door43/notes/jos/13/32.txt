\v 32 Moses had allotted to those tribes the land that was on the plain of the Moab \add region\add*, on the east side of the Jordan \add River\add*, across from Jericho.
\v 33 But Moses did not allot any land to the tribe of Levi because Yahweh, the God whom we Israelites worship, promised that he himself would always provide for them.

<usfm>
\v 32 These were the lands that Moses distributed to the people of Israel on the plains of Moab, when they were beyond the Jordan just east of Jericho.
\v 33 But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance. Yahweh, who is the God of Israel, promised them that he would be their inheritance.
