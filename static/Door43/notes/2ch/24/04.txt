\v 4 Some years later, Joash decided that the temple should be repaired.
\v 5 He summoned the priests and other descendants of Levi and said to them, "Go to the towns of Judah and collect from the people the tax money that they are required to pay each year, and use that money to pay for repairing the temple. Do it immediately." But the descendants of Levi did not do it immediately.

\v 4 It came about after this, that Joash decided to restore the house of Yahweh.
\v 5 He gathered together the priests and the Levites, and he said to them, "Go out every year to the cities of Judah and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God. Make sure that you start right away." The Levites did nothing at first.
