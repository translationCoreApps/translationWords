\v 38 If you are not ready to die because you belong to me, then you are not worthy to belong to me.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about the reasons why they should not be afraid of the persecution that they might experience.

  * **He who ... is not worthy** - Here "he" means any person in general. AT: "Those who ... are not worthy" or "If you ... you are not worthy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
  * **loves** - The word for "love" here refers to "brotherly love" or "love from a friend." AT: "cares for" or "is devoted to" or "is fond of"
  * **worthy of me** - "deserve to belong to me" or "worthy to be my disciple"
  * **pick up his cross and follow after me** - "carry his cross and follow me." The cross represents suffering and death. Taking up the cross represents being willing to suffer and die. AT: "must obey me even to the point of suffering and dying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **pick up** - "take up" or "pick up and carry"
  * **He who finds ... will lose ... he who loses ... will find** - Jesus uses a proverb to teach his disciples. This should be translated with as few words as possible. AT: "Those who find ... will lose ... those who lose ... will find" or "If you find ... you will lose ... if you lose ... you will find" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]])
  * **finds** - This is a metaphor for "keeps" or "saves." AT: "tries to keep" or "tries to save" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will lose it** - This does not mean the person will die. It is a metaphor that means the person will not experience spiritual life with God. AT: "will not have true life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who loses his life** - This does not mean to die. It is a metaphor that means a person considers obeying Jesus more important than his own life. AT: "who denies himself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for my sake** - "because he trusts me" or "on my account" or "because of me." This is the same idea as "for my sake" in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16|10:18]].
  * **will find it** - This metaphor means the person will experience spiritual life with God. AT: "will find true life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
