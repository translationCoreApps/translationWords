===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 4 For you say to God, 'My beliefs are pure,
\q I am blameless in your eyes.'
\q
\v 5 But, oh, that God would speak
\q and open his lips against you;
\q
\v 6 that he would show you the secrets of wisdom!
\q For he is great in understanding.
\q Know then that God demands from you less than your iniquity deserves.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **My beliefs are pure** - "My understanding is correct"
  * **I am blameless in your eyes** - The eyes represent sight, which is a metaphor for God's evaluation of Job. Possible meanings are 1) that Job is saying that God judges him as blameless. AT: "You say that I am blameless" or 2) that Job believes he has been blameless and that God should judge him as blameless. AT: "You should recognize that I am blameless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **that God would speak ... open his lips against you** - The words "open his lips" are a metonym that means speak. These two phrases mean the same thing and are used together to emphasize Zophar's desire that God would speak harshly against Job. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **that he would show ... secrets of wisdom** - What the "secrets of wisdom" are can be stated clearly. AT: "that he would show you that you are suffering because of your sin"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **God demands from you less than your iniquity deserves** - Demanding from Job represents punishing Job. AT: "God is punishing you less than you deserve" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
