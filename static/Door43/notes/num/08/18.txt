\v 19 I have appointed the descendants of Levi to help Aaron and his sons at the Sacred Tent, as Aaron and his sons offer the sacrifices to take away \add the guilt of\add* the Israelite people's sins, and to prevent the Israelites from coming close to the tent with the result that a plague would cause many of them to become sick and die."

\v 18 I have taken the Levites from among the people of Israel instead of all the firstborn.
\v 19 I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons. I have taken them from among the people of Israel to do the work of the people of Israel in the tent of meeting. I have given them to atone for the people of Israel so that no plague will harm the people when they come near to the holy place."

  * **I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons** - Yahweh appointing the Levites to help Aaron and his sons is spoken of as if they were a gift that Yahweh were giving to Aaron and his sons. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I have taken them ... I have given them** - Here "them" refers to the Levites.
  * **instead of all the firstborn** - The missing words may be added to make the meaning clear. AT: "instead taking all of the firstborn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **when they come near** - Here "they" refers to the people of Israel.
