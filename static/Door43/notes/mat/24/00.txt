=== Structure and Formatting ===

In this chapter, Jesus begins to prophesy about the future leading up to his return as king of the universe. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "The end of the world" ==

In this chapter, Jesus gives an answer to his disciples when they ask how they will know when he will come again. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_apocalypticwriting]])

== The example of Noah ==

In the time of Noah, there was a great flood which God sent as punishment for the sins of man. There were many warnings about this coming flood, but it actually began suddenly. In this chapter, Jesus draws a comparison between that flood and the last days. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Let" ==

The ULB uses this word to begin several commands of Jesus, such as "let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains" (24:16), "let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out anything that is in his house" (24:17), and "and let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak" (24:17). There are many different ways to form a command. Translators must select the most natural ways in their own languages.
