===== translationNotes: =====

  * **terror in the night** - The psalmist speaks of "terror" as if it were a spirit or fierce animal that could attack at night and so terrify people. AT: "things attacking you at night" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in the night ... by day** - These two phrases taken together refer to all possible times of night and day. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])

  * **or of the plague that roams** - The psalmist speaks of illness as if it were a person who went about at night killing other people. AT: "You will not be afraid of dying from illness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **roams** - goes wherever he wants to go at any time
  * **in the darkness ... at noontime** - These two phrases taken together refer to all possible times of night and day. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **disease** - an illness that makes many people ill at the same time

  * **it will not reach you** - "the evil will not harm you."
