\v 4 Manasseh built pagan altars in the house of Yahweh, although Yahweh had commanded, "It is in Jerusalem that my name will be placed forever."
\v 5 He built altars for all the stars of heaven in the two courtyards of the house of Yahweh.
\v 6 In the valley of Ben Hinnom he put his sons into the fire. He performed soothsaying and sorcery; he read omens; and he consulted with those who talked with the dead and with those who talked with spirits. He practiced much evil in the sight of Yahweh and he provoked God to anger.
