\v 4 Yahweh, you are like a strong tower where poor people can find refuge,
\q2 a place where needy people can go when they are distressed.
\q1 You are like a place where people can find refuge in a storm
\q2 and where they can stay in the shade, out of the hot sun.
\q1 People oppress us and show us no mercy,
\q2 they are like a storm beating against a wall,
\q2
\v 5 and like the very strong heat in the dry land.
\q1 But you cause the noisy cries of people from foreign nations to be quiet.
\q2 Like the air cools when a cloud comes overhead,
\q2 you stop merciless people from singing songs about how great they are.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 4 For you have been a place of safety for the one who is poor, 
\q1 a shelter for the one who is needy in his distressâ€”
\q1 a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat.
\q1 When the breath of the ruthless was like a storm against a wall,
\q1
\v 5 and like  heat in a dry land,
\q1 you subdued the noise of foreigners,
\q1 as the heat is subdued by the shade of a cloud, 
\q1 so the song of the ruthless ones is answered.
