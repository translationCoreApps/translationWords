\v 33 No one can accuse us before God of doing wrong, for he has chosen us to belong to him. He is the one who has put us right with himself.
\v 34 No one can condemn us any longer. Christ is the one who died for us—and more than that, he also was raised from the dead—and he is ruling with God in the place of honor, and he is the one who is pleading for us.
