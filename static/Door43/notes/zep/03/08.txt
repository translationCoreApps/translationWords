\q1 I have decided to gather the people of the kingdoms of the earth

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 Therefore wait for me—this is Yahweh's declaration—until the day that I rise up for the victim.
\q For my decision is to gather the nations, to assemble the kingdoms,
\q and to pour out upon them my anger, all my fierce wrath,
\q so that all the land will be devoured by the fire of my anger.
\f + \ft The Hebrew text as \fqa until the day that I rise up for the victim \fqa* . However, some ancient and modern versions have \fqa until the day that I rise up as a witness \fqa* . \f*
