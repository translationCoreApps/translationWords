===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Jeshurun** - This is another name for the people of Israel. It means "upright one." Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:32:15|32:15]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **rides through the heavens ... on the clouds** - This is an image of Yahweh riding on clouds through the sky like a king on his chariot riding through a battlefield. AT: "rides through the heavens like a king rides through a battlefield ... on the clouds like a king on his chariot" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to your help** - "to help you." Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "you" here is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
