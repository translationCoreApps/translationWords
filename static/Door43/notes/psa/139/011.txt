\v 11 I could wish for the darkness to hide me,
\q1 or I could wish for the light around me to become darkness.
\q1
\v 12 But even if that happened, you would still see me.
\q1 For you the night is as bright as the daytime,
\q2 because daylight and darkness are no different to you.

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 If I said, "Surely the darkness will cover me,
\q and the light will become night around me,"
\q
\v 12 even the darkness would not be dark to you.
\q The night would shine like the day,
\q for the darkness and the light are both alike to you.
