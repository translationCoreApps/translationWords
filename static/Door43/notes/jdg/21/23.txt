They rebuilt their cities \add that had been burned down\add*, and they lived there.

\v 23 The people of Benjamin did so. They took the number of wives that they needed from the girls who were dancing and they carried them off to be their wives. They went and returned to the place of their inheritance. They rebuilt the towns and lived in them.
\v 24 Then the people of Israel left that place and went home, each one to his own tribe and clan, and each one to his own inheritance.
