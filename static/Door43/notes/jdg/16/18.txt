\v 18 Delilah realized that this time he had told her the truth. So she summoned the Philistine leaders again, saying, "Come back one more time, because Samson has really told me everything \add about why he is so strong\add*". So the Philistine leaders returned and brought to Delilah the money \add that they promised to give her\add*.
\v 19 Again she lulled Samson to sleep, with his head in her lap. Then she called one of the Philistine men to come and shave off Samson's hair. As he did that, Samson began to get weaker. And finally his strength was all gone.

So she called together the Philistine leaders, saying, "Come back one more time, because Samson has finally told me the secret about his strength." So the Philistine leaders returned and gave Delilah the money they promised to give her.
\v 19 Again she lulled Samson to sleep, with his head in her lap. Then she called one of the Philistine men to come and cut off Samson's hair. As he did that, Samson became weak; he had no more strength.

\v 18 When Delilah saw that he had told her the truth about everything, she sent and called for the rulers of the Philistines, saying, "Come up again, for he has told me everything." Then the rulers of the Philistines went up to her, bringing the silver in their hands.
\v 19 She had him fall asleep in her lap. She called for a man to shave off the seven locks of his head, and she began to subdue him, for his strength had left him.
