\q1 So bring us back \add to obey\f + \ft Or: worship \f* you again\add*,
\q2 because we are ready to return to you,
\q1 because you alone are Yahweh, our God.

\v 19 We turned away from you,
\q2 but we repented;
\q1 after you caused us to realize \add that we were guilty\add*.
\q2 We beat our breasts to show that we were very ashamed \f + \ft doublet \f* of the sins that we committed when we were young.'
\q1
\v 20 But I, Yahweh, say this:
\q2 The Israelite people certainly are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* still my dear children \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1 It is often necessary for me to threaten \add to punish\add* them,

\q
\v 18 "I have certainly heard Ephraim sorrowing, 'You punished me, and I have been punished like an untrained calf.
\q Bring me back and I will be brought back, for you are Yahweh my God.
\q
\v 19 For after I turned back to you, I was sorry; after I was trained, I slapped my thigh.
\q I was ashamed and humiliated, for I have borne the guilt of my youth.'
\q
\v 20 Is not Ephraim my precious child? Is he not my dear, delightful son?
\q For whenever I speak against him, I certainly still call him to my loving mind. In this way my heart longs for him.
\q I will certainly have compassion on himâ€”this is Yahweh's declaration."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I have certainly heard Ephraim sorrowing** - Ephraim was the ancestor of the largest tribe in Israel. His name is a metonym for the people of Israel. AT: "I have certainly heard the descendants of Ephraim sorrowing" or "I have certainly heard the people of Israel sorrowing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **You punished me, and I have been punished** - The speaker repeats the phrase to show either that Yahweh punished him severely or that Ephraim learned what Yahweh wanted to teach him through punishing him. The words "I have been punished" can be translated in active form. AT: "You punished me. Yes, you punished me severely" or "You punished me, and I have learned from that punishment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I have been punished like an untrained calf** - When people train calves, they strike them and otherwise cause them to suffer. Yahweh had caused the people of Israel to suffer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **punished** - Another possible meaning is "disciplined."
  * **I slapped my thigh** - in grief. If people use a different phrase or action in your language to show that they are very sad, you may want to use it here. AT: "I rubbed my brow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **I was ashamed and humiliated** - The words "ashamed" and "humiliated" mean basically the same thing and intensify the idea of shame. AT: "I was completely ashamed." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Is not Ephraim my precious child? Is he not my dear, delightful son?** - Yahweh is speaking tenderly, trying to comfort the people. These questions can be translated as statements. AT: "Ephraim is my precious child. He is my dear, delightful son. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
