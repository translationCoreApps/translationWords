  * **Yahweh's hand is not so short** - "Hand" represents power and ability. A "short" hand does not have power and ability. AT: "Yahweh is fully able" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **your ... you** - These plural pronouns refer to the people of Israel as a single group. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
