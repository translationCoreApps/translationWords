====== Hosea 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter focus on the meaning of the illustration of Hosea's marriage. It is a very short chapter written in prose to show the truth of Israel's relationship with Yahweh. After bearing a number of children for Hosea, Gomer leaves him and prostitutes herself with other men showing little to no regard for their marriage covenant. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]]) 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==

This chapter contains a continuation of the metaphor played in chapter 2. Hosea is told to go and buy his wife out of slavery. Gomer must have been captured and held as a slave due to her adulterous activity. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:adultery]])
