\v 13 If it is true that I have ever refused to listen to one of my male or female servants
\q2 when they complained to me about something,
\q1
\v 14 I hope that God would stand up and declare that he will punish me;
\q2 when he does that, what could I do?
\q2 If he asked me about what I have done, what would I answer?
\q1
\v 15 God, who created me, certainly also created my servants;
\q2 surely he is the one who formed them and me in our mothers' wombs,
\q2 so we all should behave toward each other in the same way.

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 If I ignored the plea for justice from my male or female servant
\q when they argued with me,
\q
\v 14 what then would I do when God rises up to accuse me?
\q When he comes to judge me, how would I answer him?
\q
\v 15 Did the one who made me in the womb not make them also?
\q Did not the same one mold us all in the womb?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])

  * **what then would I do when God rises up to accuse me? When he comes to judge me, how would I answer him?** - Job uses these questions to emphasize that if God were to judge him, Job would not be able to make himself appear to be good. AT: "then there would absolutely nothing I could say to defend myself when God comes to judge me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **Did the one who made me in the womb not make them also? Did not the same one mold us all in the womb?** - Job uses these questions to emphasize that he is no different from his servants. He implies that God would be angry if Job were to treat his servants as less valuable that himself. AT: "The one who made me in the womb also made them. He formed  us all in the womb." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
