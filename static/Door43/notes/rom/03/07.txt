\v 7 But someone might answer, "The fact that God truly keeps his promises becomes very clear because for example, I told a lie and the result is that people praise God because he has mercy! So God should no longer say that I should be punished on account of my having sinned, since people are praising him because of it!
\v 8 If what you, Paul, say is true, then we might as well do evil things in order that good things like that will result!" Some people speak evil about me because they accuse me of speaking like this. God will punish people who say such things about me, and they will deserve for him to punish them!

\v 7 But if the truth of God through my lie provides abundant praise for him, why am I still being judged as a sinner?
\v 8 Why not say, as we are falsely reported to say, and as some affirm that we say, "Let us do evil, so that good may come"? The judgment on them is just.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But if the truth of God through my lie provides abundant praise for him, why am I still being judged as a sinner?** - Here Paul imagines someone continuing to reject the Christian gospel. That adversary argues, because his sin shows the righteousness of God, then God should not declare that he is a sinner on judgment day if, for example, he tells lies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Why not say ... come"?** - Here Paul raises a question of his own, to show how ridiculous the argument of his imaginary adversary is. AT: "I might as well be saying ... come!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **as we are falsely reported to say** - "some lie to tell others that this is what we are saying"
  * **The judgment on them is just** - It will be only fair when God condemns these enemies of Paul, for telling lies about what Paul has been teaching.
