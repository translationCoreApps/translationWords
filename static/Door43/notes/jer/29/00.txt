====== Jeremiah 29 General Notes ======



=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Two letters ==

Jeremiah sent a letter to Babylon telling the exiles to prepare for a long stay. A false prophet in Babylon wrote back to the chief priest telling him to punish Jeremiah. Even though Jeremiah had prophesied the exile, the Jews still did not believe him. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:believe]])
