  * **I am** - Here the word "he" is not present in the original text, but it is implied. AT: "I am he" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **This was in order to fulfil the word that he said** - Here "the word" refers to the words Jesus had prayed. You can translate this in an active form.
