===== translationNotes: =====

  * **kneel** - put both knees on the ground
  * **the people of his pasture** - The word "pasture" is a metonym for the food that animals eat in the pasture, which in turn is a synecdoche for everything that Yahweh provides for his people. AT: "we are the people whose needs he meets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **pasture** - an area where animals find grass to eat
  * **the sheep of his hand** - The word "hand" here is a metaphor for how Yahweh protects his people the way a shepherd protects his sheep. AT: "the people whom he protects like a shepherd protects his sheep" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Today—oh, that you would hear his voice!** - The psalmist purposely interrupts what he is saying. "Oh, that you would hear his voice today!"
  * **hear his voice** - "listen carefully to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
