====== Genesis 22 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Sacrificing his son ==
Although Isaac was not Abraham's only son, he was the son who was to inherit Abraham's promised blessings. It is possible this parallels God's actual sacrifice of his son, Jesus, for the sins of man. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:inherit]], [[:en:obe:kt:promise]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

== Covenant affirmation ==
After important events, it is common for Scripture to affirm the tenants of a covenant. This serves as a reminder of the covenant and affirms it. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== God tests Abraham ==
Extra care should be taken when translating "testing." It is best to avoid using the same word used for "tempting" even though they overlap in meaning. This is because Scripture also says God does not tempt anyone. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:test]], [[:en:obe:kt:tempt]] and [[:en:bible:notes:jas:02:12| James 2:13]])
