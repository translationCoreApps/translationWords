===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh continued and said, "Son of man, take a large clay tablet and scrape lines on it that represent Jerusalem.
\v 2 Then draw figures around it to represent enemy soldiers who will build earthworks and forts around the city in order to take it. Set figures around it that represent battering rams.
\v 3 Then take an iron pan, and place it to be like an iron wall between you and the carving of the city. Then stare at the image of the city. This means that enemy troops will surround the city to attack it. This will be a warning to the Israelite people.

\p
\v 1 "But you, son of man, take a brick for yourself and place it before you. Then carve the city of Jerusalem on it.
\v 2 Then lay siege against it, and build forts against it. Raise up an assault ramp against it and set camps around it. Place battering rams all around it.
\v 3 Then take for yourself an iron pan and use it as an iron wall between yourself and the city and set your face against it, for it will be under siege, and you are to put  the siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel. He tells Ezekiel to take a brick and dirt and pieces of wood and act as if he were Yahweh destroying the city of Jerusalem.

  * **son of man** - "son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "mortal person" or "human"
  * **carve the city of Jerusalem** - You may need to make explicit that Ezekiel is to carve a picture. AT: "carve a picture of the city of Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **lay siege against it** - "surround the city in order to capture it"
  * **build forts against it** - "build strong walls against it." The walls would keep people from leaving the city.
  * **Raise up an assault ramp against it** - "build a ramp outside of it for the enemies to get inside." Jerusalem had a wall around it to protect the people inside. The enemies could only get inside if they had a ramp to climb up over the wall.
  * **Place battering rams all around it** - "Battering rams" are large trees or poles that many men in an army would pick up and hit against a wall or door so they could break it down and get inside. "Set around it huge poles people would use to break down the gates and get inside"
  * **set your face against it** - This is a command  to stare at the model of the city as a symbol of punishing the city. AT: "stare at the city" or "stare at the city so that it will be harmed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]]) 
  * **set your face** - Here "face" is a metonym for attention or gaze, and "set your face" refers to literally staring at something. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
