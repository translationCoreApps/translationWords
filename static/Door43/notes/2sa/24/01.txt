===== translationNotes: =====
  * **the anger of Yahweh was ignited against Israel** - The word "ignite" means start a fire. Here Yahweh's anger is compared to that of a fire. AT: "the anger of Yahweh started to burn like a fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he moved David against them** - "he caused David to oppose them"
  * **Go, count Israel and Judah** - In the law of Moses, God prohibited the kings of Israel from taking a census of fighting men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **Dan to Beersheba** - This phrase uses two place names Dan, in the far north, and Beersheba, in the far south, to represent the entire country. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **count all the people ... fit for battle** - This means to count all the men except those men who are either too young, too old, or physically unable to fight.
