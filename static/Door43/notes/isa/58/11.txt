===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **satisfy you in regions where there is no water** - This means they will have all they need for an abundant life. Judah was a dry land, and water was essential to life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You will be like a watered garden** - They will have all they need. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **like a spring of water, whose waters never fail** - This means the same thing as the previous phrase. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
