====== John 14:10-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Do you not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* believe that I have a close relationship with \add my\add* Father, and that \add my\add* Father has a close relationship with me? The messages that I tell you do not come from me. They come from my Father, who has a close relationship with me. He is enabling me to \add teach these things, and\add* to work the miracles that he \add wants me to do\add*.
\v 11 Believe that I have a close relationship with \add my\add* Father and that \add my\add* Father has a close relationship with me. If you do not believe that just because of what I say, believe it because of the miracles themselves \add that I have done\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Do you not believe that I am joined to my Father and that my Father is joined to me? The things I have told youâ€”I did not think of these things; rather, it is my Father who has sent me to tell you all of these things, for my Father is joined to me and works through me.
\v 11 Trust me because I have told you that I am joined to the Father and that the Father is joined to me, or else trust me because of all the signs and mighty acts you have seen me do.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from my own authority, but it is the Father living in me who is doing his work.
\v 11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me, or else believe because of the works themselves.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus asks Philip a question and then he continues to speak to all of his disciples.

  * **Do you not believe ... in me?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to emphasize Jesus' words to Philip. AT: "You really should believe ... in me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **The words that I say to you I do not speak from my own authority** - "What I am telling you is not from me" or "The words I tell you are not from me"
  * **The words that I say to you** - Here "you" is plural. Jesus is now speaking to all of his disciples.
  * **I am in the Father, and the Father is in me** - This is an idiom that means God the Father and Jesus have a unique relationship. AT: "I am one with the Father, and the Father is one with me" or "my Father and I are just as though we were one" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
