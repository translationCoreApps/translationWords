\v 8 Yahweh also said to Aaron, "I myself have appointed you to take care of all the sacred offerings that the Israelite people bring to me. I have given all these sacred offerings to you and to your sons. You and your descendants will get a share of these offerings permanently.
\v 9 The parts of the offerings that are not completely burned on the altar belong to you. Those parts of the sacred offerings, including the grain offerings, the offerings to make atonement for sins and to remove the guilt of sins, are set apart, and are to be given to you and your sons.

\v 8 Then Yahweh said to Aaron, "Look, I have given you the duty of handling the offerings raised up to me, and all the holy offerings that the people of Israel give to me. I have given these offerings to you and your sons as your ongoing share.
\v 9 These are the very holy things, kept from the fire: from every offering of theirs—every grain offering, every sin offering, and every guilt offering—they are very holy to you and to your sons.
