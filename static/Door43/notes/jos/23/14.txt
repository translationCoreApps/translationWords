====== Joshua 23:14-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 It is almost time for me to die, like everyone else does \f + \ft euphemism \f*. You know in your inner beings \f + \ft doublet \f* that Yahweh has done for you \f + \ft litotes \f* everything that he promised to do.
\v 15 He has given to you all the good things that he promised. In the same way, the other things that he promised, \add things that are not good\add*, will also happen. He said that if you do what is evil, he will get rid of you and send you away from this good land that he has given to you.

<usfm>
\v 14 It is almost time for me to die, like everyone else does. You know deep within you, that every single thing that Yahweh promised to do for you, he has done it.
\v 15 He has given to you all the good things he promised. In the same way, the other things that he promised, things that are not good, will also happen if you do what is evil. In that case he will take your lives and your land away from you.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 14 Now I am going the way of all the earth, and you know with all your hearts and souls that not one word has failed to come true of all the good things that Yahweh your God promised about you. All these things have come about for you. Not one of them has failed.
\v 15 But just as every word Yahweh your God promised you has been fulfilled, so Yahweh will bring on you all the evil things until he has destroyed you from this good land that Yahweh your God has given you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I am going the way of all the earth** - Joshua uses a polite term to refer to his death. AT: "I am going to die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **know with all your hearts and souls** - Here the words "hearts" and "souls" have similar meanings. Together they emphasize deep personal knowledge. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **not one word has failed to come true** - These words emphasize that Yahweh's promises have all occurred. This can be stated in positive form. AT: "every word has come true" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
