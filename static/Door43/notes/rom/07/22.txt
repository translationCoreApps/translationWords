====== Romans 07:22-23 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 With my new inner nature I like the laws of God very much.
\v 23 Nevertheless, I sense that there is a different force that is in my body\f + \ft Or: me \f* \f + \ft personification, synecdoche \f*. It is opposed to what with my mind \add I desire to do\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and it puts me inescapably under the control of \f + \ft metaphor \f* the sinful \add desires\add* that I have \f + \ft synecdoche \f*.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 In my new attitude I am very happy about the law of God.
\v 23 Nevertheless, I sense that there is a different power that is in my body. It is opposed to what with my mind I desire to do, and it makes me do what my old sinful attitude wants me to do.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 For I rejoice in the law of God with the inner man.
\v 23 But I see a different principle in my body parts. It fights against that new principle in my mind. It takes me captive by the principle of sin that is in my body parts.
