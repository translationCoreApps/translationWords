\v 18 Because you did not obey the voice of Yahweh and did not carry out his fierce wrath on Amalek, he has therefore done this today to you.
\v 19 Moreover, Yahweh will hand over Israel and you into the hand of the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. Yahweh will also hand over the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines."

  * **will be with me** - This is a polite way to say that Saul will die. AT: "will be dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **Yahweh will also hand over the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines** - Samuel speaks as if the army of Israel were a small object that Yahweh would give to the Philistines, whom he speaks of as if they were one person.
