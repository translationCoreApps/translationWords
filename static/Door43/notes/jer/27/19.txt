===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah continues to bring the message of Yahweh.

  * **the pillars, the sea, and the base** - These were objects that were in the temple. The "sea," was a molten bronze basin.
  * **Jehoiachin** - The Hebrew text has "Jeconiah," which is a variation of the name "Jehoiachin." Many modern versions have "Jehoiachin" in order to make it clear that the same king is being referred to.
