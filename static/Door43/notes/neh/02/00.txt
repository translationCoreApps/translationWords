====== Nehemiah 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter begins the account of the construction of the wall. Many scholars believe these chapters teach valuable lessons on leadership. (See: Chapters 2-6)

== Special concepts in this chapter ==

== Nehemiah's character ==
Apparently, Nehemiah's character made an impression on the king. It was very unusual for a king to be so concerned with one of his servants. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== Cultural Customs ==
In ancient Persia, they thought it was important for their conquered peoples to practice their own cultural customs. It was thought that this independence promoted peace in their vast kingdom. The rebuilding of Jerusalem may have been seen as a way to allow for the Jewish cultural practices. 

== Yahweh's control ==
Yahweh is seen as very powerful. He is able to provide for his people, even through a foreign king. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:peopleofgod]])
