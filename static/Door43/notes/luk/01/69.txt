===== translationNotes: =====

  * **a horn of salvation for us** - The horn of an animal is a symbol of its power to defend itself. The Messiah is spoken of as if he were a horn with the power to save Israel. AT: "someone with the power to save us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in the house of his servant David** - David's "house" here represents his family, specifically, his descendants. AT: "in the family of his servant David" or "who is a descendant of his servant David" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **as he spoke** - "just as God said"
  * **spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets** - God enabled the prophets to speak the words he wanted them to speak. God's control can the stated. AT: "caused his holy prophets to say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **by the mouth of** - This speaks of the prophets' messages as if they were only a mouth saying words. AT: "in the words of" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **were in ancient times** - "lived long ago"
  * **bring salvation** - This here refers to physical rescue, rather than to spiritual salvation.
  * **our enemies ... all who hate us** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are repeated to emphasize how strongly their enemies are against them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **from the hand of** - It may be helpful to restate "salvation" here. AT: "salvation from the hand of" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **hand** - "power" or "control." The word "hand" represents the power that wicked persons use against God's people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
