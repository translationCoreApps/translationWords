====== Genesis 31:48-50 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 48 Laban said to Jacob, "This pile of rocks we have put here today will help us to remember our agreement." That is why Jacob called it Galeed.
\v 49 They also named the place Mizpah, \add which sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'watchtower,'\add* because Laban said, "We will ask Yahweh to watch you and me while we are separated from each other, \add so that we do not try to harm each other\add*.
\v 50 If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take other women to be your wives, even if no one tells me about it, don't forget that God sees what you and I are doing!"

\v 48 Laban said, "This pile is a witness between me and you today." Therefore its name was called Galeed.
\v 49 It is also called Mizpah, because Laban said, "May Yahweh watch between you and me, when we are out of sight one from another.
\v 50 If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take any wives besides my daughters, although no one else is with us, see, God is witness between you and me."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This pile is a witness between me and you** - The stones do not actually bear witness as a person. AT: "This pile will be a reminder between me and you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Galeed** - Translators may add a footnote that says: "The name Galeed means 'heap of witness' in Jacob's language. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:31:45|31:47]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Mizpah** - Translators may add a footnote that says: "The name Mizpah means 'watchtower.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **when we are out of sight one from another** - Here "out of sight" stands for no longer being in each other's presence. AT: "when we are no longer with each other" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **although no one else is with us** - Here "us" refers to Laban and Jacob. AT: "even if no one else is there to see us"
  * **see** - "remember." This adds emphasis to what is said next.
