\v 37 But Paul said to them, "They have publicly beaten us without a trial, even through we are Romans citizens—and they threw us into prison. Do they now want to send us away secretly? No! Let them come themselves and lead us out."
\v 38 The guards reported these words to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Romans, they were afraid.
\v 39 The magistrates came and apologized to them and brought them out, asking them  them to go away from the city.
