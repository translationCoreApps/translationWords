\v 20 The next day when the disciples saw that the fig tree was completely dead. They were astonished and said to Jesus, "How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?"
\v 21 Jesus said to them, "Think about this: If you believe that God has power to do what you ask him to and you do not doubt that, you will be able to do things like what I have done to this fig tree. You will even be able to do marvelous deeds like saying to that hill over there, 'Uproot yourself and throw yourself into the sea,' and it will happen!
\v 22 In addition to that, whenever you ask God for something when you pray to him, if you believe that he will give it to you, you will receive it from him."

\v 20 When the disciples saw it, they marveled and said, "How did the fig tree immediately wither away?"
\v 21 Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to this fig tree, but you will even say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' and it will be done.
\v 22 Whatever you ask for in prayer, believing, you will receive."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **How did the fig tree immediately wither away?** - The disciples use a question to emphasize how surprised they are. AT: "We are astonished that the fig tree has dried up so quickly!" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Truly I say to you** - "I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **if you have faith and do not doubt** - Jesus expresses the same idea both positively and negatively to emphasize that this faith must be genuine. AT: "if you truly believe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) 
  * **wither away** - "dry up and die"
  * **you will even say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,'** - You can translate this direct quotation as an indirect quotation. This can also be stated in active form. AT: "you will even be able to tell this mountain to get up and throw itself into the sea" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
