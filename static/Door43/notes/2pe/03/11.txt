\v 11 Because God will certainly destroy all these things like I just said, you certainly know how you should behave. You should behave in a way that honors God,
\v 12 while you eagerly wait for Christ to return on the day that God has appointed, and you should try to make that day come soon. Because of what God will do on that day, the heavens will perish. The elements will melt and burn up.
\v 13 Although all those events will happen, we rejoice because we are waiting for the new heavens and new earth that God has promised. The only people who will be in the new heavens and on this new earth will be people who are righteous.

\v 11 Since all these things will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people should you be? You should live holy and godly lives.
\v 12 You should expect and hasten the coming of the day of God. On that day, the heavens will be destroyed by fire, and the elements will be melted in great heat.
\v 13 But according to his promise, we are waiting for the new heavens and the new earth, where righteousness will dwell.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter begins to tell the believers how they should live as they wait for the day of the Lord.

  * **Since all these things will be destroyed in this way** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Since God will destroy all these things in this way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **what kind of people should you be?** - Peter uses this rhetorical question to emphasize what he will say next, that they "should live holy and godly lives." AT: "you know what kind of people you should be." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the heavens will be destroyed by fire, and the elements will be melted in great heat** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will destroy the heavens by fire, and he will melt the elements in great heat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the elements** - Possible meanings are 1) the heavenly bodies, such as the sun, moon, and stars or 2) the things that make up heaven and earth, such as soil, air, fire, and water. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2pe:03:10|3:10]].
  * **where righteousness will dwell** - Peter speaks of "righteousness" as if it were a person. This is a metonym for people who are righteous. AT: "where righteous people dwell" or "where people will live righteously" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
