\v 5 Then I, Daniel, looked, and there were two others standing. One stood on the bank on this side of the river, and one stood on the bank on the other side of the river.
\v 6 One of them said to the man clothed in linen, the one who was upstream along the river, "How long will it be to the end of these amazing events?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Daniel goes on to tell what he saw next in this vision that began in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:10:01|10:1]].

  * **there were two others standing** - "there were two other angels standing" 
  * **the man clothed in linen** - This refers to the angel who appeared to Daniel in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:10:04|10:5]], not to one of the angels who is standing beside the river. This can be stated in active form. AT: "the man who was wearing linen clothes" or "the angel who was wearing linen clothes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **upstream along the river** - Possible meanings are 1) the angel clothed in linen was above the river or 2) the angel was further upstream along the river.
  * **How long will it be to the end of these amazing events?** - "How long will these amazing events last?" This refers to the time from the beginning to the end of the events.
  * **these amazing events** - At the time when the angel spoke to Daniel, none of the events in this vision had happened. This definitely refers to the the events in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:12:01|12:1-4]], and may possibly also include the events in the vision from chapter 11.
