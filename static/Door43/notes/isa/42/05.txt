===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the one who created the heavens and stretched them out, the one who made the earth** - The prophet speaks of Yahweh creating the heavens and the earth as if the heavens and earth were fabric which Yahweh stretched out. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **gives breath to the people on it and life to those who live on it** - These phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh gives life to every person. The word "breath" is a metonym for life. AT: "gives life to the people who live on the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **have called you** - Here "you" is singular and refers to Yahweh's servant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_yousingular]])
  * **I will ... set you as a covenant for the people** - Here the word "covenant" is a metonym for the one who establishes or mediates a covenant. AT: "I will ... make you be the mediator of a covenant with the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a light for the Gentiles** - Yahweh speaks of making his servant the one who delivers the nations from bondage as if he were making him a light that shines in dark places for the Gentiles. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
