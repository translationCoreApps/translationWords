===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Isaac dug out** - Here "Isaac" stands for Isaac and his servants. AT: "Isaac and his servants dug out" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **which they had dug** - "which Abraham's servants had dug"
  * **in the days of Abraham his father** - The phrase "in the days of" stands for a person's lifetime. AT: "when Abraham, his father, was living." See how this was translated in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:26:15|26:15]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The Philistines had stopped them up** - This was the reason that Isaac dug them out. Possible ways to translate this are: 1) Since this happened first, this sentence can come before the sentence about Isaac digging them out, as in the UDB. or 2) This sentence can start with "Isaac did this because the Philistines had stopped them up." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_events]])
  * **had stopped them up** - "had filled them with earth"
