===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is what happened after the death of King Amaziah.

  * **They brought him back on horses** - "They brought Amaziah's body back on horses" 
  * **All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah** - This is a generalization. Some people may not have wanted him to be king.

  * **It was Azariah who rebuilt Elath** - Azariah did not do this alone. AT: "It was Azariah who ordered Elath to be rebuilt" or "It was Azariah who supervised the rebuilding of Elath" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Azariah** - This king is better known today by the name "Uzziah."
  * **Elath** - a city in Judah (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **restored it to Judah** - "returned it to Judah"
  * **slept with his ancestors** - This is a poetic way to say he died. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
