<usfm>
\v 20 But some day, he will be taken away \f + \ft Or:his \add enemies\add* will take him away \f* from them. Then, in those days, they will abstain from food, \add because they will be sad\add*."
\p
\v 21 \add Jesus wanted to show that those who desire to live in accordance with his new message should not try to continue to obey the old religious traditions like fasting. So he also said to them\add*, "People do not sew a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment \add in order to mend a hole\add*. If they did that, \add when they washed the garment, the patch would shrink\add* and the new \add piece of cloth\add* would tear off more of the old cloth. As a result, the hole would become bigger!

If they did, when they washed the garment, the patch would shrink and the new piece of cloth would tear off more of the old cloth. As a result, the hole would become even bigger!
