====== Ephesians 06 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Slavery ==
This passage does not condone slavery as an acceptable practice. Paul's teaching on slavery would have been rather radical during his time because masters were not expected to treat their slaves in such a pleasant way. Overall, Paul's focus is on living in a way that pleases God despite the circumstances of one's life. Remember, Paul is in prison when he writes these words.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Armor of God ==
This is an extended metaphor describing how a Christian can protect themselves from spiritual "attacks" in their daily life. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
