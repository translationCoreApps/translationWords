\v 12 How you are fallen from heaven, daystar, son of the morning! 
\q1 How you are cut down to the ground, you who conquered
the nations!
\q1
\v 13 You had said in your heart, 'I will ascend into heaven, 
\q1 I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, 
\q1 and I will sit on the mount of assembly, in the far reaches of the north.
\q1
\v 14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High God.'

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **How you are fallen from heaven, daystar, son of the morning** - This refers to the morningstar, the star that rises and indicates morning is coming soon. Isaiah refers to the king of Babylon in terms of this star in order to imply that the king once was great, but that God has destroyed him. AT: "You were like the morning star, but you have fallen from the sky" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **I will sit on the mount of assembly, in the far reaches of the north** - This passage is an allusion to the myth, very well known in parts of the Ancient Near East, that the Canaanite gods met in council on the top of a sacred mountain in the far north, which apparently had the name of Zaphon. This name appears in the verse, and some modern versions keep it: "far away on the sides of Zaphon."
