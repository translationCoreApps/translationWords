===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the fourth year ... the eleventh year** - The words "fourth" and "eleventh" are the ordinal forms of "four" and "eleven." You may need to make explicit the event from which the writer counts the years. AT: "the fourth year after Solomon became king ... the eleventh year after Solomon became king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **house of Yahweh** - "the temple" (UDB)
  * **in the month of Ziv** - "Ziv" is the name of the second month of the Hebrew calendar. It is during the last part of April and the first part of May on Western calendars. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:06:01|6:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month** - "Bul" is the eighth month of the Hebrew calendar. It is during the last part of October and the first part of November on Western calendars.

  * **the house was finished in all its parts and conforming to all its specifications** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "they finished building every part of the house. They built it exactly the way Solomon had told them to build it"
  * **Solomon took** - It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people helped Solomon do this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
