\v 41 Then Jesus sat down across from an offering box in the temple area; he was watching people as they dropped their money into the box. Many rich people put in large amounts of money.
\v 42 Then a poor widow came and put in two mites, worth about a penny.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Still in the temple area, Jesus comments on the value of the widow's offering.

  * **an offering box** - This box was a collection box for the temple offering for all the people.
  * **two mites** - "two small copper coins" (UDB). These were the least valuable coins available. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]])
  * **worth about a penny** - "worth very little" (UDB). A penny is worth very little. Translate "penny" with the name of the smallest coin in your language if you have one that is worth very little.
