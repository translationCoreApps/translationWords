===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 But you \add who are my disciples\add* should not allow people to address you \add honorably\add* as 'Rabbi', \add which means 'teacher\add*'. I \add am the\add* only one who is \add really\add* your teacher, which means that you are all \add equal, like\add* brothers and sisters, \add and none of you should act superior to another, as the Pharisees do\add*.
\v 9 Do not \add honor anyone\add* on earth \add by\add* addressing him as 'Father', because God, your Father in heaven, is the only \add spiritual\add* father of all of you.
\v 10 Do not \add allow people to\add* call you 'Instructors', because I, the Messiah, am the one instructor who\add teaches all of\add* you.

\v 8 But you, my disciples, should not allow people to call you 'Teacher,' as they do other Jewish teachers. I am the only one who is really your teacher. This means that you are all equal to each other, like brothers and sisters.
\v 9 Do not honor anyone on earth by addressing him as 'Father,' because God, your Father in heaven, is your only true father.
\v 10 Do not allow people to call you 'teacher,' because the Messiah is your only teacher.

\v 8 But you must not be called 'Rabbi,' for you have only one teacher, and all you are brothers.
\v 9 And call no man on earth your father, for you have only one Father, and he is in heaven.
\v 10 Neither must you be called 'teacher,' for you have only one teacher, the Christ.
