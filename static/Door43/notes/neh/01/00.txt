====== Nehemiah 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

== "The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah:" ==
This serves as an introduction to this entire book and references everything after it.


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Repentance ==
This chapter is one long recording of Nehemiah's repentance on behalf of the people. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:repent]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== I ==
While the author of this book is probably Ezra, the word "I" is always a reference to Nehemiah.

== Israel ==
It is uncertain to whom "Israel" refers. It probably does not refer to the northern kingdom of Israel. Neither does it seem probable that it refers to the nation of Israel. Instead, it is probably a reference to Israel in the sense of the people group. This people group now exclusively refers to the tribe of Judah because the other tribes have been scattered throughout the entire Near East.
