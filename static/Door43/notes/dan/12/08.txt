===== translationNotes: =====

  * **My master** - Daniel refers to the angel clothed in linen as "My master" to show respect to the angel. 
  * **of all these things** - At the time when the angel clothed in linen spoke to Daniel, none of the events in this vision had happened. This definitely refers to the the events in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:12:01|12:1-4]], and may possibly also include the events in the vision from chapter 11.
  * **for the words are shut up and sealed** - The vision that was given to Daniel was not to be explained. The book was sealed and no one could access it. AT: "for you are to close up and seal the words you have written" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the time of the end** - "the final days" or "the end of the world." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:08:15|8:17]].
