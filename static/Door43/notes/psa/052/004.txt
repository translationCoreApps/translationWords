===== translationNotes: =====

  * **words that devour others** - Here words that harm others are spoken of as if they were animals that devour people. AT: "words that  harm others" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you deceitful tongue** - This refers to the person the author is speaking to. AT: "you speaker of deceit" or "you liar" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **take you up ... pluck you ... root you** - All three of these phrases are different ways of saying "remove you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **root you out of the land of the living** - Being alive on earth is spoken of as if people are plants with roots in the ground. God killing someone is spoken of as digging up the plant's roots and taking it out of the ground. AT: "he will take you out the land of the living" or "He will kill you so that you will no longer be on earth with living people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Selah** - This may be a musical term that tells people how to sing or play their instruments here. Some translations write the Hebrew word, and some translations do not include it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
