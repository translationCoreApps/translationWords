\v 40 So then be careful that God does not judge you, as the prophets said that God would do!

\q 'You who ridicule me, you will certainly be astonished when you see what I am doing, and then you will be destroyed. You will be astonished because I will do something terrible to you while you are living. You would not believe that I would do that even though someone told you!'"
