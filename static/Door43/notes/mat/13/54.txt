\v 54 Then they went to the town of Nazareth, the hometown of Jesus. On the Sabbath he began to teach the people in the synagogue. The result was that the people there were astonished. But some said, "This man is just an ordinary person like us! So how is it that he knows so much and understands so much? And how is it that he is able to do such miracles?
\v 55 He is just the son of the carpenter, is he not? His mother is Mary, and his younger brothers are James, Joseph, Simon and Judas!
\v 56 And his sisters also live here in our town. So how is he able to teach and do all these things?"

\v 54 Then Jesus entered his own region and taught the people in their synagogue. The result was that they were astonished and said, "Where does this man get his wisdom and these miracles from?
\v 55 Is not this man the carpenter's son? Is not his mother Mary? And his brothers, are they not James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
\v 56 And his sisters, are they not all among us? So where does this man get all these things from?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is the beginning of a new part of the story that runs through [[:en:bible:notes:mat:17:26|17:27]], where the writer tells of continued opposition to Jesus' ministry and teaching about the kingdom of heaven. Here, the people of Jesus' home town reject him.

  * **his own region** - "his hometown." This refers to the town of Nazareth where Jesus grew up. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **in their synagogue** - The pronoun "their" is referring to the people of the region.
  * **they were astonished** - "they were amazed"
  * **Where does this man get his wisdom and these miracles from?** - "How can an ordinary man like this be so wise and do such great miracles?"
  * **Is not this man the carpenter's son? Is not his mother Mary? And his brothers, are they not James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all among us? So where does this man get all these things from?** - The crowd uses this series of questions to show their surprise that an ordinary person from their region could do all these things. AT: "Jesus is just a carpenter's son. We know his mother, Mary. And his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas, and his sisters all live among us. An ordinary man should not be able to do these things!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **the carpenter's son** - A carpenter is someone who makes things with wood or stone. If "carpenter" is not known, "builder" can be used.
