  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues his metaphor in which he speaks of the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. This metaphor continues through [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:23:33|23:34]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **my soul turned away from her** - Here the "soul" represents one's emotions. AT: "I became disgusted with her and rejected her" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **brought to mind and imitated the days of her youth** - The phrase "brought to mind" is an idiom that means to remember. AT: "remembered and did the same things as she had done when she was young" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
