\v 32 Those who do not know God are always worrying about things like that. But God, your Father who is in heaven, knows that you need all those things, \add so you should not worry about them\add*.
\v 33 Instead, the most important thing you should be concerned about is to let \add God\add* completely direct your life, and to strive \add to live\add* righteously. \add If you do that\add*, all the things that you \add need\add* will be given to you \f + \ft Or:God will give you all the things \add that you need\add* \f*.
\v 34 So \add each day\add* do not be worried about what will happen to you the next day, because \add when\add* that day \f + \ft personification \f* comes, \add you\add* will be concerned about \add what happens during\add* that day. You will have enough to be concerned about each day. \add So do not worry ahead of time\add*."

\v 32 Those who do not know God are always worrying about things like that. But God, your Father who is in heaven, knows that you need all those things.
\v 33 Instead, make it the most important thing that God should rule over the entire world and that everyone should do what he requires. If you do that, he will give you all the things that you need.
\v 34 So do not be worried about what will happen to you the next day, because when that day comes, you will have enough to be concerned about. So do not worry ahead of time."

\v 32 For the Gentiles search for these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
\v 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you.
\v 34 Therefore, do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day has enough evil of its own.
