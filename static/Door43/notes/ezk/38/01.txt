===== translationNotes: =====
  * **The word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Gog, the land of Magog** - It is implied that Magog is the land over which Gog rules. AT: "Gog who rules over the land of Magog" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Gog** - This is the name of a leader or king who ruled in the land of Magog. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Magog** - This is the name of an ancient nation that probably lived in the land that is now Turkey. Magog might be the ancient nation of Lydia.
  * **the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal** - This expression occurs twice in these verses. Some modern versions, however, interpret the Hebrew expression as "the chief of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal." This is another title for Gog. AT: "who is the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Meshech ... Tubal** - Translate these names as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:32:26|32:26]].
  * **Behold!** - This emphasizes the importance of the statement that follows. It can be translated as "Look!" or "Listen!" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you!"
  * **I am against you** - This idiom means "I am your enemy." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
