===== translationNotes: =====

  * **supports all who are falling ... raises up all those who are bent over** - The psalmist speaks of Yahweh encouraging people as if he were helping people who were physically weak. You may need to translate both lines using only one line. AT "encourages those who are discouraged" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The eyes of all wait** - "Everyone waits" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **You open your hand** - "You generously provide"
  * **satisfy the desire of every living thing** - "you give everyone more than they need and as much as they want"
