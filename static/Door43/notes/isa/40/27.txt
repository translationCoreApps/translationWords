===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Why do you say, Jacob, and declare, Israel ... vindication"?** - The question emphasizes that they should not say what they say. AT: "'You should not say, O people of Israel ... vindication'." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Why do you say, Jacob, and declare, Israel** - These two phrases both refer to the people of Israel. AT: "Why do you say, O people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) 
  * **My way is hidden from Yahweh** - Yahweh not knowing what happens to them is spoken of as if Yahweh could not see the road upon which they travel. AT: "Yahweh does not know what happens to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my God is not concerned about my vindication** - Possible meanings are 1) "my God is not concerned about others treating me unjustly" or 2) "my God is not concerned about treating me justly."
  * **Have you not known? Have you not heard?** - Isaiah uses these questions to emphasize that the people should know Yahweh's greatness. See how you translated these in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:40:21|40:21]]. AT: "You certainly know and have heard!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the ends of the earth** - The places on the earth that are very far away are spoken of as if they were the places where the earth ends. This phrase also forms a merism and refers to everywhere in between the ends. AT "the farthest places of the earth" or "the entire earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
