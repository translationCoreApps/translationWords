  * **from a foreigner's hand** - The word "hand" represents the person. AT: "from a foreigner" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **as food of your God** - God did not actually eat the sacrifices. Priests would offer the sacrifice on God's altar, and they would eat some of the meat. This can be stated in active form. AT: "as a food offering to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
