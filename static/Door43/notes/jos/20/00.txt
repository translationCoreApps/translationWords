== Cities of Refuge ==

If a person was killed, it was the duty of his relatives to kill the killer. If the death was an accident, this would be unfair. Therefore, God told the Israelites to make cities of refuge for a person who killed someone accidentally. In the city where he sought refuge, his case would be solved legally: "Do this so that one who unintentionally kills a person can go there. These cities will be a place of refuge from anyone who seeks to avenge the blood of a person who was killed." (See: [[:en:obe:kt:refuge]], [[:en:obe:kt:avenge]] and [[:en:obe:kt:blood]])
