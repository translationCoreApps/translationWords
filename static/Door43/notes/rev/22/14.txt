===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues giving his closing greeting.

  * **those who wash their robes** - Becoming righteous is spoken of as if it were washing one's clothing. See how you translated as similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:07:13|7:14]]. AT: "those who have become righteous, as if they have washed their robes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Outside** - This means they are outside the city and not allowed to enter.
  * **are the dogs** - In that culture the dog was an unclean, despised animal. Here the word is derogatory and refers to people who are wicked. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
