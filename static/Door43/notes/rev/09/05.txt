===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 They were not given permission to kill those people, but only to torture them for five months. Their agony would be like the sting of a scorpion when it strikes a person.
\v 6 In those days people will seek death, but will not find it. They will greatly desire to die, but death will flee from them.
