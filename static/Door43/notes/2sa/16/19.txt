===== translationNotes: =====

  * **what man should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of his son?** - Hushai asks these rhetorical questions to emphasize that he wants to serve Absalom. They can be written as a statement. AT: "I should serve only David's son, so I will serve in his presence." or "I should serve you, for you are David's son." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
