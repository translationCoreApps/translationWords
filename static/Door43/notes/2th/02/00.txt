====== 2 Thessalonians 02 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Being gathered together to be with him" == 

Many scholar believe this passage refers to an event known as the "rapture." This is a time when Jesus calls those who believe in him to himself. The timing of this hypothetical event is the matter of much speculation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:believe]])

== Antichrist ==
Other names for the Antichrist in this chapter are the "man of lawlessness," "the lawless one" and the "son of destruction." During the time prophesied in this chapter, Satan will be actively at work in the world. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:antichrist]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Sits in the temple of God ==
Since the temple no longer exists, it is possible this is a reference to the idea that the temple will one day be rebuilt. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
