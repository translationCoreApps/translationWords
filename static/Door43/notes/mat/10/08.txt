===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about what they should do when they go to preach.

  * **you ... your** - These are plural and refer to the twelve apostles. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Freely you have received, freely give** - There is information here that is not stated, but it is understood. AT: "I helped you and taught you God's truth for free. Therefore, you should not make other people pay for you to help them or to teach them God's truth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **gold, silver, or copper** - These are metals out of which coins were made. This list is a metonym for money, so if the metals are unknown in your area, translate the list as "money." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **purses** - This means "belts" or "money belts," but it can refer to whatever might be used to carry money. A belt is a long strip of cloth or leather worn around the waist. It was often wide enough that it could be folded and used to carry money.
  * **traveling bag** - This could either be any bag used to carry things on a journey, or a bag used by someone to collect food or money.
  * **an extra tunic** - Use the same word you used for "tunic" in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:40|5:40]].
  * **laborer** - "worker"
  * **his food** - Here "food" refers to anything a person needs. AT: "what he needs" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
