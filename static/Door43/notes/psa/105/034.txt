===== translationNotes: =====

  * **so many locusts** - "there were so many locusts"
  * **The locusts ate up all of the vegetation ... They ate up all the crops of the ground** - These two phrase have basically the same meaning and are used together for emphasis. AT: "The insects ate all the plants and all the crops in the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He killed every firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their strength** - Here the second phrase about the "firstfruits" is used to describe the "firstborn" in the first phrase. AT: "He killed every firstborn in their land, which were the firstfruits of all their strength" or "Then Yahweh killed the oldest son in every house of the people of Egypt" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
