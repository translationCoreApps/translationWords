<usfm>
\v 1 Christ set us free from the law so that it may control us no longer. So stop anyone who says you are still slaves to the law, and do not let the law control you like slaves again.
\v 2 Consider very carefully what I, Paul, an apostle, now tell you. If you let anyone circumcise you, what Christ has done for you will not help you at all!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul applies the allegory by reminding the believers to use their liberty in Christ because all the law is fulfilled in loving neighbors as ourselves.

  * **For freedom** - The translation needs to emphasize "freedom" in contrast with the slavery talked about in the previous verses.
  * **For freedom Christ has set us free** - "It is so that we can be free that Christ has set us free"
  * **Stand firm** - Standing firm here represents being determined not to change. How they are not to change can be stated clearly. AT: "Do not give in to the arguments of people who teach something else" or "Be determined to stay free" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **if you let yourselves be circumcised** - Paul is using circumcision as a metonym for Judaism. AT: "if you turn to the Jewish religion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
