<usfm>
\v 1 Now about this collection of money for the believers in Jerusalemâ€”all those people whom God has set apart for himself, I really do not need to write anything more to you.
\v 2 I already know that you want to help, and I praised you for this to the believers of Macedonia. In fact, I told them that you, and the other people of the province of Achaia, have been preparing for this collection since last year. Your enthusiasm is an example that has moved the believers of Macedonia to take action.

\v 1 Concerning the ministry for the believers, it is not necessary for me to write to you.
\v 2 I know about your desire, which I boasted about to the people of Macedonia. I told them that Achaia has been getting ready since last year. Your eagerness has motivated most of them to action.

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues on the subject of giving. He wants to make sure that the collection of their offering for the needy believers in Jerusalem takes place before he comes so that it does not seem as though he takes advantage of them. He talks about how giving blesses the giver and glorifies God.
