===== translationNotes: =====

  * **put a message in his mouth** - The message is spoken of as if it is something that God put into his mouth. AT: "told him what to say." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:num:22:38|22:38]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He said** - "Then Yahweh said"
  * **Balak, and hear ... Listen to me, you son of Zippor** - These two phrases mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize how important it was for Balak to pay attention. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **son of Zippor** - This refers to Balak. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:num:22:02|22:2]].
