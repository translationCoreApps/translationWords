====== Galatians 02:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 After fourteen years passed, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas. I took Titus also.
\v 2 But \add I tell you that\add* I went up there because of what God revealed to me. \add It was not because someone asked me to come\add*. I told people what was the good message that I was preaching in regions where non-Jews live. But I talked privately to those whom your new teachers highly respect. I did that in order that what I was doing and what I had done \f + \ft metaphor \f* might not become useless \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add as a result of people rejecting my message because they thought that I was teaching something that was not true\add*.

\v 1 After fourteen years passed, Barnabas, Titus, and I went up again to Jerusalem.
\v 2 We did this because God had told me we should go. I explained privately to the most important leaders of the believers the content of the good news that I had been proclaiming in the regions of the non-Jews. I did this because I wanted to make sure that they approved of what I had been preaching. I wanted to make sure that I had not been working uselessly.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me.
\v 2 I went up because of a revelation and set before them the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles. I spoke privately to those who seemed to be important, in order to make sure that I was not running—or had not run—in vain.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues to give the history of how he learned the gospel from God, not the apostles.

  * **went up** - "traveled." Jerusalem is located in hilly country. The Jews also viewed Jerusalem as the place on earth that is closest to heaven, so Paul may have been speaking figuratively, or it may be that it was reflecting the difficult, uphill, journey to get to Jerusalem.
  * **those who seemed to be important** - "the most important leaders among the believers" 
  * **I was not running—or had not run—in vain** - Paul uses running as a metaphor for work, and he uses a double negative to emphasize that the work he had done was profitable. AT: "I was doing, or had done, profitable work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in vain** - "for no benefit" or "for nothing"
