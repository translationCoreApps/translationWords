\v 25 Because he is very cunning\f + \ft Or: clever \f*, he will succeed by doing things that deceive many people. He will be proud of himself. He will get rid of many people when they think that they are safe. He will also rebel against \add God\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*, who is the greatest king. But \add God\add* will destroy him, without the help \f + \ft metonymy \f* of any human being.

\v 24 He will become very powerful, but it will not be because of what he himself does. He will destroy things in many places, and he will succeed in everything he does. He will get rid of many brave soldiers and the people who are holy.
\v 25 Because he is very cunning, he will succeed by deceiving others. He will become very arrogant, and he will destroy many people without warning. He will even rebel against God, the greatest king, who will destroy him without any human power.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 His power will be greatâ€”but not by his own power. He will be amazing in what he destroys; he will act and succeed. He will destroy powerful people, people among the holy ones.
\v 25 By his craftiness he will make deceit prosper under his hand. He will become great in his own mind. He will unexpectedly destroy many people. He will even rise up against the King of kings, and he will be broken, but not by any human hand.
