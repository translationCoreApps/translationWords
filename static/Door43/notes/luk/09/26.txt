<usfm>
\v 26 As for people who reject my message and refuse to say that they belong to me, I, the Son of Man will also refuse to say that they belong to me when I come back in my glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
\v 27 But I tell you this fact: some of you standing here now will not die until you see God show himself as king!"

<usfm>
\v 26 Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his own glory, and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
\v 27 But I say to you truly, there are some of you who are standing here, who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my words** - "what I say" or "what I teach"
  * **of him will the Son of Man be ashamed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the Son of Man ... when he comes** - Jesus was speaking about himself. AT: "I, the Son of Man ... when I come" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **the Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **But I say to you truly** - Jesus uses this phrase to emphasize the importance of what he will say next.
  * **some of you who are standing here** - "some of you who are here with me"
  * **some of you ... they see** - "some of you" does not include all the disciples. Therefore, either "they see" or "you see" would be correct. Choose the one that fits well in your language. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God** - This can be rewritten to make "not ... until" easier to understand. AT: "will see the kingdom of God before they die" or "will see the kingdom of God before you die"
  * **taste death** - This idiom means "die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
