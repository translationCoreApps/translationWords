\v 12 At that time Merodach Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
\v 13 Hezekiah listened to those letters, and then showed the messengers all the palace and his valuable things, the silver, the gold, the spices and precious oil, and the storehouse of his weapons, and all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his kingdom, that Hezekiah did not show them.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Merodach Baladan ... Baladan** - These are the names of the king of Babylon and his son. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **listened to those letters** - 1) "carefully considered those letters" or 2) "heard the message from the king of Babylon" 
  * **There was nothing ... that Hezekiah did not show them** - "Nothing" and "not" cancel each other out to make the idea positive. This exaggeration is used for emphasis. AT: "Hezekiah showed him absolutely everything in his house and in all his kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
