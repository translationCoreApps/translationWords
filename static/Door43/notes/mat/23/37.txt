You killed them by throwing stones at them \f + \ft doublet \f*!

\v 37 "O people of Jerusalem, you who killed the prophets who lived long ago, and you who killed others whom God sent to you with stones. Many, many times I wanted to gather you together to protect you, like a hen gathers her young chicks under her wings. But you did not want me to do that.
\v 38 So listen to this: Your city will become an uninhabited place.
\v 39 Keep this in mind: You will see me again only when I return, when you say about me, 'God is truly pleased with this man who comes with God's authority.'"

\v 37 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often did I long to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
\v 38 See, your house is left to you desolate.
\v 39 For I say to you, You will not see me from now on until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus mourns over the people of Jerusalem because they reject every messenger that God sends to them.

  * **Jerusalem, Jerusalem** - Jesus speaks to the people of Jerusalem as though they were the city itself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **those who are sent to you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "those whom God sends to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **your children** - Jesus is speaking to Jerusalem as if it is a woman and the people are her children. AT: "your people" or "your inhabitants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings** - This is a simile that emphasizes Jesus' love for the people and how he wanted to take care of them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **hen** - a female chicken. You can translate with any bird that protects her children under her wing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
