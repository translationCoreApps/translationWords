\v 1 You must not watch your fellow Israelite's ox or his sheep go astray and hide yourself from them; you must surely bring them back to him.
\v 2 If your fellow Israelite is not near to you, or if you do not know him, then you must bring the animal home to your house, and it must be with you until he looks for it, and then you must restore it to him.
