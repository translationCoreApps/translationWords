This letter shows how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches. 

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "1 Timothy" or "First Timothy." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "Paul's First Letter to Timothy." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

This book is the first letter Paul wrote to his disciple and close friend Timothy, probably near the end of his life. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is discipleship? ===

The term disciple refers to a person who spends time with a teacher, learning from that teacher's character and teaching. Discipleship is the process of making disciples of Christ. This letter gives many instructions about how a leader should train a less mature Christian. The goal of discipleship is to encourage other Christians to grow in likeness to Christ. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:disciple]])

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

== Singular and plural "you" ==
In this book, the word "I" refers to Paul. Also, the word "you" is almost always singular and refers to Timothy. The exception to this is 6:21. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

=== What does Paul mean by the expression "in Christ," "in the Lord," etc.? ===

Paul means to express the idea of very close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.

=== What are the major textual issues in the text of the Book of 1 Timothy? ===

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of 1 Timothy:

  * "Withdraw from such things." (6:5) Some older versions have this reading, but the ULB, UDB, and most other modern versions do not. The best ancient copies do not have this phrase.
