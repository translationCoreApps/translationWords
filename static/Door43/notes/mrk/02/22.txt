===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins to tell another parable about putting new wine in old wineskins as opposed to new wineskins. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **new wine** - "grape juice." This refers to wine that has not fermented yet. If grapes are unknown in your area, use the general term for fruit.
  * **old wineskins** - This refers to wineskins that have been used many times.
  * **wineskins** - These were bags made out of animal skins. They could also be called "wine bags" or "skin bags" (UDB).
  * **the wine will burst the skins** - New wine expands as it ferments, so it would cause old, brittle wineskins to tear open.
  * **lost** - "ruined" (UDB)
  * **fresh wineskins** - "new wineskins" or "new wine bags." This refers to wineskins that have never been used.
