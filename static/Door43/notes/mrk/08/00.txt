====== Mark 08 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Bread ==
Bread is a special image in this chapter. Jesus gave the people their daily need for bread as God provided manna for Israel every day in the wilderness. Mark also spoke of yeast, the ingredient that causes bread to rise before it is baked. Yeast is used as a negative metaphor in Scripture. (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

== "Adulterous generation" ==
This is a common image in Scripture used to represent an unfaithful generation of the people of God. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:unfaithful]] and [[:en:obe:kt:peopleofgod]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
Jesus uses many rhetorical questions in this chapter as a way of teaching the disciples and convicting the Pharisees. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:08:16|8:17-21]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== The use of paradox ==

This is a statement that seems absurd, and appears to contradict itself. A paradox occurs in this chapter: "Whoever wants to save his life will lose it" ([[:en:bible:notes:mrk:08:35|8:35-37]]).
