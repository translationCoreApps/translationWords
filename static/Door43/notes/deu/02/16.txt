\v 16 So it happened, when all the men fit for fighting were dead and gone from among the people,
\v 17 that Yahweh spoke to me, saying,
\v 18 'You are today to pass over Ar, the border of Moab.
\v 19 When you come near opposite the people of Ammon, do not trouble them or fight them; for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession; because I have given it to the descendants of Lot as a possession.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues reminding the people of Israel of what happened in the past.

  * **You are ... you come ... do not trouble ... give you** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and the command "do not trouble" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **pass over Ar** - This is the name of a city in Moab. See how you translated "Ar" in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:02:09|2:9]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **to the descendants of Lot** - The people of Israel were related to the descendants of Ammon. Ammon was the son of Lot. Lot was the nephew of Abraham. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
