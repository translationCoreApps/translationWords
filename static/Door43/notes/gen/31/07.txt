\v 8 When Laban said, 'The speckled animals are the ones that I will give you to be your wages,' then all the animals gave birth to young ones that were speckled. When he changed and said, 'The ones that have black and white stripes on them will be your wages,' then all the animals gave birth to young ones that were striped.

\v 7 Your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times, but God has not permitted him to hurt me.
\v 8 If he said, 'The speckled animals will be your wages,' then all the flock bore speckled young. If he said, 'The striped will be your wages,' then the whole flock bore striped young.
\v 9 In this way God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.
