AT: "You know that Yahweh corrects the nations, so you can be sure that he will correct his people" or "he will punish his people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **does he not correct** - This can be stated in positive form. Possible meanings are 1) God corrects. AT: "he corrects" or 2) God punishes. "he punishes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **that they are vapor** - Here the thoughts of men are compared to vapor or steam that disappears into the air. This metaphor shows how unimportant and useless they are. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
