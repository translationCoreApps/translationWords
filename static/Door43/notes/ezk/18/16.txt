\q2 He gives clothes to those who need clothes.
\q1
\v 17 He does not commit sins, \add like his father did\add*,
\q2 and does not charge big interest \f + \ft doublet \f* when he lends money.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Suppose that he does not oppress anyone, seize a pledge, or take stolen things, but instead gives his food to the hungry and covers the naked with clothes.
\v 17 Suppose that he draws his hand back from the poor and does not take interest or gains too much profit. Suppose that he carries out my decrees and walks according to my statutes. Then he will not die for his father's sin; he will surely live!
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa the poor \fqa* , some ancient and many modern versions have \fqa from sin \fqa* . \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak about the son who does not commit the same sins as his father.

  * **he draws his hand back from the poor** - Here "hand" represents the person and his actions. Possible meanings are 1) he does not harm poor people by his actions. AT: "he does not harm poor people" or 2) the word "poor" can be translated as "iniquity," meaning that the person does not commit iniquity. AT: "he refrains from committing iniquity" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **interest** - This word refers to the money paid by a person to use borrowed money. However, some modern versions interpret "interest" in this passage as "too much interest."
  * **walks according to my statutes** - Yahweh speaks of obeying his statutes as if the person were walking along his statutes. AT: "obeys my statutes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
