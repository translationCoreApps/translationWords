===== translationNotes: =====

  * **arise** - "stand." Here this word means to begin doing something. In this case Yahweh is now exalting himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **now I will be lifted up; now I will be elevated** - This can be stated in active form. These two phrases have basically the same meaning and emphasize Yahweh being exalted. AT: "now I will exalt myself and show that I deserve for everyone to honor me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **You conceive chaff, and you give birth to stubble** - This speaks of the Assyrians making plans as if they were conceiving and giving birth to their plans as a mother gives birth to a baby. This speaks of their plans being useless by comparing them to chaff. AT: "You make plans that are as useless as chaff and straw" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **stubble** - "straw"
  * **your breath is a fire that will consume you** - Here the Assyrians' plans are referred to as their "breath." This speaks of their plans causing them to die as if their plans would literally burn up their bodies. AT: "your plans will cause you to die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The peoples will be burned to lime, as thornbushes are cut down and are burned** - This compares how the peoples' dead bodies will be burned to the way thornbushes are burned. Also, this can be stated in active form. AT: "Fire will burn the peoples' bodies to lime in the same way that a farmer cuts down thornbushes and burns them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **lime** - the ashes from burned bones
