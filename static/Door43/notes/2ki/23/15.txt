\v 15 Furthermore, he commanded them to tear down the place of worship at Bethel which had been built by King Jeroboam \add #1\add*, the king who persuaded the people of Israel to sin. They tore down the altar. Then they broke its stones into pieces and pounded them to become powder. They also burned the statue \add of the goddess\add* Asherah.
\v 16 Then Josiah looked around and saw some tombs there on the hill. He commanded his men to take the bones out of those tombs and burn them on the altar. By doing that, he desecrated the altar. That was what a prophet had predicted many years before when Jeroboam \add #1\add* was standing close to that altar at a festival.
\p Then Josiah looked up and saw the tomb of the prophet who had predicted that.

\v 15 Furthermore, he commanded them to tear down the place of worship that was near the city of Bethel, the very same place of worship that had been built by King Jeroboam (whose father was Nebat, the same man who made Israel to sin against Yahweh). Josiah led the people of Israel to tear down that altar that was on the high hill, and they also burned the wooden pole used in the worship of the idol that had the name "Asherah."
\v 16 Then Josiah looked around and saw some tombs on the hill. He commanded his men to take the bones out of those tombs and burn them on the altar. By doing that, he desecrated the altar. These events were predicted many years before when Yahweh gave his word to Israel by his prophet.

\v 15 Josiah also completely destroyed the altar that was at Bethel and the high place that Jeroboam son of Nebat (the one who made Israel to sin) had constructed. He also burned that altar and the high place and beat it to dust. He also burned the Asherah pole.
\v 16 As Josiah looked over the area, he noticed the graves that were on the hillside. He sent men to take the bones from the graves; then he burned them on the altar, which defiled it. This was according to the word of Yahweh which the man of God had spoken, the man who spoke of these things beforehand.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Josiah also completely destroyed ... He also burned ... and beat ... He also burned** - It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people, perhaps Hilkiah and "the priests under him" ([[:en:bible:notes:2ki:23:04|23:4]]), might have helped Josiah do these things. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **spoke of these things beforehand** - "had said that these things would happen"
