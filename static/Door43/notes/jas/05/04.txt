\v 4 Think about what you have done. You did not pay the wages you promised to the workmen who harvested your fields for you. The pay you kept for yourself shows me your guilt and how unfair you were to them. The workers cry out to God, for how you treat them. And the Lord God of the angel armies listens to their loud cries.
\v 5 You have bought anything you wanted so you could live like kings. Just like cattle fatten themselves, not realizing that they will be slaughtered, you have lived just to enjoy things, not realizing that God will severely punish you.
\v 6 You have arranged for others to condemn innocent people. You have arranged for others to kill people, even though those people had not done anything wrong. They were not able to defend themselves against you. My brothers and sisters, that is what I say to the rich people who oppress you.

\v 4 Look, the pay of the laborers is crying out—the pay that you have withheld from those who harvested your fields. And the cries of the harvesters have gone into the ears of the Lord of hosts.
\v 5 You have lived in luxury on the earth and indulged yourselves. You have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter.
\v 6 You have condemned and killed the righteous person. He does not resist you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - James continues to warn rich people about thier focus on pleasure and riches.

  * **the pay of the laborers is crying out—the pay that you have withheld from those who harvested your fields** - The money that should have been paid is spoken of as a person who is shouting because of the injustice done to him. AT: "the fact that you did not pay those you hired to work in your fields shows that you have done wrong" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **the cries of the harvesters have gone into the ears of the Lord of hosts** - The shouts of the harvesters are spoken of as if they could be heard in heaven. AT: "the Lord of hosts has heard the cries of the harvesters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **into the ears of the Lord of hosts** - God is spoken of as if he had ears as humans have. AT: "the Lord of hosts has heard" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter** - Here people are viewed as if they were cattle, luxuriously fed on grain so they would become fattened to be slaughtered for a feast. However, no one will feast at the time of judgment. AT: "Your greed has only prepared you for harsh eternal judgment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your hearts** - Here "hearts" is used as the center of human desire. The word here stands for the entire person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **You have condemned ... the righteous person** - This is probably not "condemned" in the legal sense of a judge passing a sentence of death on a criminal. Instead, it probably refers to the wicked and powerful people who decide to mistreat the poor until they die.
  * **the righteous person** - "the people who do what is right." This expression refers to righteous people in general and not to a specific person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **does not resist you** - "does not oppose you"
