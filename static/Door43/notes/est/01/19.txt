<usfm>
\v 19 So if it pleases you, O king, you should write a law. \add Like all the other\add* laws of Persia and Media, it will be a law that no one can change\f + \ft Or: cannot be changed. \f* Write a law that states that Queen Vashti will never be allowed to see you again \add and will not continue to be the queen\add*. Then you can choose another woman to be queen, a woman who deserves to be queen more than Vashti does.
\v 20 Then, when everyone in your empire hears what you have commanded, all the women, including those who are important and those who are not important, will respect and obey their husbands."

<usfm>
\v 19 So if it pleases your Majesty, you should write a law, like all the laws of Persia and Media, to be a law that no one can change. This law should say that Queen Vashti will never be allowed to see you again, and you will choose another woman to be queen, a woman who deserves to be queen more than she does.
\v 20 When everyone in your empire hears what you have commanded, all the wives, those who are important and those who are not important, will honor their husbands."

<usfm>
\v 19 If it pleases the king, let a royal decree be sent out from him, and let it be written in the laws of the Persians and the Medes, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti may no longer come before him. Let the king give her position as queen to another who is better than she.
\v 20 When the king's decree is proclaimed throughout all his vast kingdom, all the wives will honor their husbands, from the greatest to the least significant."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Memucan continues to answer the king.

  * **If it pleases the king ... from him ... before him ... Let the king ... the king's decree ... his vast kingdom** - Memucan speaks to the king in third person as a form of respect. AT: If it pleases your Majesty ... from you ... before you ... Please ... your decree ... your vast kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **which cannot be repealed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "which no one can change" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **When the king's decree is proclaimed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "When they hear the king's decree" or "When they hear what you have commanded" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **vast** - "big" or "huge"
  * **from the greatest to the least significant** - This is a merism that refers to both extremes and everyone in between. This probably refers to the husbands, but it is possible that it refers to the wives. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
