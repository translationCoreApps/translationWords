\v 14 On the eighth\f + \ft Or: next \f* day, he must take two doves or two young pigeons and come in front of Yahweh at the entrance of the Sacred Tent, and give them to the priest.
\v 15 The priest will sacrifice them. One will be an offering for the man to become acceptable to God, and the other one will be completely burned \add on the altar\add*. As a result of the priest doing that, the man will no longer be guilty for having sinned.

\v 13 When he who has a flow is cleansed from his flow, then he must count for himself seven days for his cleansing; then he must wash his clothes and bathe his body in running water. Then he will be clean.
\v 14 On the eighth day he must take two doves or two young pigeons and come before Yahweh at the entrance to the tent of meeting; there he must give the birds to the priest.
\v 15 The priest must offer them, one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, and the priest must make atonement for him before Yahweh for his flow.
