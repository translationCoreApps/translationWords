\v 14 Then we will no longer be \add spiritually immature\add*, like \f + \ft metaphor \f* little children \add are immature\add*. We will no longer be constantly \add changing what we believe, like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* waves of the sea are \add constantly changing as the wind blows and\add* tosses them back and forth. We will not allow people who teach \add what is false\add* and who scheme\f + \ft Or: try cleverly \f* to deceive, Or: influence us.
\v 15 Instead, by loving \add others\add* as we behave according to \add God's\add* truth \f + \ft Or: speak in a loving manner what is true \f*, we will become more and more like Christ in every way. He is the one \add who controls\f + \ft Or: guides \f* all his people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like a person's\add* head \add controls\f + \ft Or: guides \f* his\add* body.
\v 16 He \add enables all those who belong to him to mature spiritually. Specifically, they will become mature spiritually\add* by loving each other and by each of them doing the work \add that God wants them to do. That is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a person's body \add grows stronger, as\add* each part of the body is joined to the others by the ligaments and as each part functions properly\f + \ft Or: works as it should \f*.

\v 14 Once we are mature, we will no longer be ignorant of what is true, like little children. We will no longer follow every new teaching, like a boat is blown around by the wind and waves. We will not allow people who teach what is false to trick us and deceive us.
\v 15 Instead, we will live by loving God and trusting his true teachings, and we will become more and more like Christ in every way. He controls his people like a person's head controls his body.
\v 16 He enables all believers everywhere to grow together and love each other, like a person's body fits together and holds together by the joints that connect the body together, which allows the body to grow and build itself up because the parts of body depend upon each other.

\v 14 Christ builds us up so that we should no longer be children who are tossed back and forth by the waves, and carried away by every wind of teaching and by the trickery of people in their deceitful schemes.
\v 15 Instead, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, that is, Christ.
\v 16 Christ builds the whole body, and it is joined and held together by every supporting ligament, and when each part works together, that makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **be children** - Paul refers to believers who have not grown spiritually as if they were children who have had very little experience in life. AT: "be like children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **tossed back and forth ... carried away by every wind of teaching** - This speaks of a believer who has not become mature and follows wrong teaching as if that believer were a boat that the wind is blowing in different directions on the water. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **by the trickery of people in their deceitful schemes** - "by crafty people who trick believers with clever lies"
  * **into him who is the head ... makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love** - Paul uses the human body to describe how Christ causes believers to work together in harmony as the head of a body causes the body parts to work together to grow healthy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **by every supporting ligament** - A "ligament" is a strong band that connects bones or organs in place in the body.
  * **in love** - "as the members love one another"
