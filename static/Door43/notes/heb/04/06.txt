\v 6 Some people still enter God's rest. But the Israelites who first heard God promise that they would restâ€”they did not enter that place of resting, because they refused to believe God.
\v 7 But God set another time when we may enter that place of resting. That time is now! We know that is true because much later than when the Israelites rebelled against God in the desert, he caused King David to write what I have already quoted,
\q "Right now, when you understand what God is saying to you, do not stubbornly disobey him."

<usfm>
\p
\v 6 Therefore, because it is still reserved for some to enter his rest, and since many Israelites who heard the good news did not enter it because of disobedience,
\v 7 God has again set a certain day called, "Today." After many days, he spoke through David, as it was earlier said,
\q "Today if you hear his voice,
\q do not harden your hearts."
