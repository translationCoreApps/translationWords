====== Daniel 12:7 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 The angel who was on the other side of \f + \ft Or: above \f* the river raised his hands toward the sky, and solemnly promised, with the authority \f + \ft metonymy \f* of God, who lives forever, "It will be three and a half years. All these things will end after God's people stop fighting against those who persecute\f + \ft Or: cause trouble for, Or: cause suffering for \f* them."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 The one wearing the linen clothes and standing further up the river raised his hands toward the sky and solemnly promised to the one who lives forever, "It will be three and a half years, and when God's holy people and their strength are no longer being shattered to pieces, then all these things are finished."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 I heard the man clothed in linen, who was upstream along the riverâ€”he raised his right hand and his left hand to heaven and swore by the one who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time. When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the man clothed in linen** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the man who was wearing linen clothes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the one who lives forever** - "God, who lives forever"
  * **it would be for a time, times, and half a time** - It is best to leave it ambiguous as to when this begins. If you must choose a starting point, the three and a half years probably start with the events of [[:en:bible:notes:dan:12:01|12:1-4]]. 
  * **a time, times, and half a time** - These "times" are generally understood to refer to years. One and two and a half equal three and a half. This could be stated. AT: "three and a half years" (UDB)
  * **all these things will be completed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "all these things will have happened" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **all these things** - At the time when the angel spoke to Daniel, none of the events in this vision had happened. This definitely refers to the the events in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:12:01|12:1-4]], and may possibly also include the events in the vision from chapter 11.
