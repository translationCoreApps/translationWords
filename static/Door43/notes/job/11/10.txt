===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 10 If he passes through and shuts anyone up,
\q if he calls anyone to judgment, then who can stop him?
\q
\v 11 For he knows false people;
\q when he sees iniquity, does he not notice it?
\q
\v 12 But foolish people have no understanding;
\q they will get it when a wild donkey gives birth to a man.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **If he ... shuts anyone up** - "If God ... shuts anyone up in prison" 
  * **if he calls anyone to judgment** - The abstract noun "judgment" can be translated with the verb "judge." AT: "if God calls anyone to go to him so that God might judge him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **who can stop him?** - This question emphasizes that no one can stop God. AT: "no one can stop him!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **does he not notice it?** - This emphasizes that God does notice sin. AT: "he surely notices it!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **But foolish people have no understanding** - The abstract noun "understanding" can be expressed with the verb "understand." AT: "But foolish people do not understand" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **they will get it when a wild donkey gives birth to a man** - Since a wild donkey can never give birth to a man, this means that foolish people will never get understanding. AT: "only if a wild donkey could give birth to a man could foolish people get understanding" or "it is as impossible for a foolish person to get understanding as it is for a donkey to give birth to a man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
