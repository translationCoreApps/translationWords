\v 15 But now bring me a musician." Then it came to pass when the harpist played, the hand of Yahweh came upon Elisha.
\v 16 He said, "Yahweh says this, 'Make this dry river valley full of trenches.'
\v 17 For Yahweh says this, 'You will not see wind, neither will you see rain, but this river valley will be filled with water, and you will drink, you and your livestock and all your animals.'
