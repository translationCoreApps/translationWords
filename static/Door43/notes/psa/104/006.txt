===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You covered the earth with water like a garment** - Here the water that covered the earth is being compared to how a large garment is able to completely cover something.  AT: "You completely covered the earth with water" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Your rebuke made the waters ... they fled** - These two phrases have basically the same meaning and are used together to emphasize how God spoke and the waters went away. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **recede** - "retreat" or "move back"
  * **they fled** - Here the psalmist speaks about the waters receding as if they fled like an animal after hearing Yahweh's voice. The word "fled" means to run away quickly. AT: "rushed away" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
