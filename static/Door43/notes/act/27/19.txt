\v 19 On the third day of the storm, the sailors threw overboard most of the sails, ropes, and poles, in order to make the ship lighter. They did this with their own hands.
\v 20 The wind continued to blow very strongly for many days, and the sky was full of dark clouds day and night so that we could not see the sun or the stars. We had lost all hope that we would survive.

\v 19 On the third day the sailors threw overboard the ship's tackle with their own hands.
\v 20 When the sun and stars did not shine on us for many days, and the great storm still beat upon us, any more hope that we should be saved was abandoned.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the sailors threw overboard the ship's tackle with their own hands** - Here "tackle" refers to the sailors' equipment needed to sail the ship. This indicates how desperate the situation was.
  * **When the sun and stars did not shine on us for many days** - They could not see the sun and stars because of the dark storm clouds. Sailors needed to see the sun and stars in order to know where they were and what direction they were headed.
  * **the great storm still beat upon us** - "the terrible storm still blew us roughly back and forth"
  * **any more hope that we should be saved was abandoned** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "everyone stopped hoping we would survive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
