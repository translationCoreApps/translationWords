\v 4 So I summoned Baruch, the son of Neraiah. Then, as I dictated to him all the messages that Yahweh had spoken to me, he wrote them on a scroll.
\v 5 Then I said to him, "I am not allowed to \add leave here and\add* go to the temple.
\v 6 So, you go to the temple on the next day when the people are fasting\f + \ft Or: abstaining from food \f*, and read to them the messages from Yahweh that you wrote while I dictated them to you.

\v 4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote in a scroll, at Jeremiah's dictation, all the words of Yahweh spoken to him.
\v 5 Next Jeremiah gave a command to Baruch. He said, "I am in prison and cannot go to Yahweh's house.
\v 6 So you must go and read from the scroll that you wrote at my dictation. On the day of the fast, you must read Yahweh's words in the hearing of the people in his house, and also in the hearing of all of Judah who have come from their cities. Proclaim these words to them.
