\v 1 One day Yahweh said to the prophet Jonah son of Amittai,
\v 2 "I have seen how wicked the people are who live in the great city of Nineveh. Therefore go there and warn the people that I am planning to destroy their city because of their sins."
\v 3 But instead of going to Nineveh, Jonah went in the direction of the city of Tarshish, to get away from Yahweh. He went down to the city of Joppa. There he paid the money to travel on a ship that was going to the city of Tarshish, and he got on.

\p
\v 1 Now the word of Yahweh came to Jonah son of Amittai, saying,
\v 2 "Get up and go to Nineveh, that great city, and speak out against it, because their wickedness has risen up before me."
\v 3 But Jonah got up to run away from the presence of Yahweh and go to Tarshish. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and boarded the ship to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of Yahweh.
