====== Titus 03:4-5 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4-5 Even though we were behaving sinfully like this, he saved us! God our Savior \add acted\add* kindly and lovingly to us \f + \ft personification \f*, \add and saved us!\add* He did this, not because we did things that are right, but just because he \add wanted to be\add* merciful to us! He washed \add us inwardly and gave\add* us a new way of living as a result of the Holy Spirit changing us inwardly.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 But when God showed us that he was acting to save all people because he loves them,
\v 5 he saved us by washing us clean on the inside, giving us a new birth, and making us new by the Holy Spirit. He did not save us because we do good things, but he saved us because he is merciful.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 But when the kindness of God our savior and his love for mankind appeared,
\v 5 it was not by works of righteousness that we did, but by his mercy that he saved us. He saved us through the washing of new birth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **when the kindness of God our savior and his love for mankind appeared** - Paul speaks of God's kindness and love as if they were people that came into our sight. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **by his mercy** - "because he had mercy on us"
  * **washing of new birth** - Paul is probably speaking of God's forgiveness for sinners as if he were physically washing them. He is also speaking of sinners who become responsive to God as if they had been born again. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
