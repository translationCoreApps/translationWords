\v 26 When he had come to Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
\v 27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. And he told them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how at Damascus Saul had boldly preached in the name of Jesus.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here the words "he" and "him" refer to Saul all but one time. "And 'he' told them how" in verse 27 refers to Barnabas.

  * **but they were all afraid of him** - "They were all" is an exaggeration for many or most of them. AT: "almost all of them" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **boldly preached in the name of Jesus** - This is a way of saying he preached or taught the gospel message of Jesus Christ without fear. AT: "openly preached the message about Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
