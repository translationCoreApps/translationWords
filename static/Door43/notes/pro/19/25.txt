===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Strike a mocker, and the naive person** - "If you strike a mocker, the naive person"
  * **Strike** - "Punish"
  * **naive person** - "inexperienced person" or "immature person"
  * **prudent** - Translate this word the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:12:23|12:23]].
  * **discipline one who is discerning, and** - "if you discipline one who is discerning,"
  * **he will gain knowledge** - Here the abstract idea of knowledge is spoken of as if it were something that one could have more of. AT: "he will know more" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
