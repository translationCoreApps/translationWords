===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem as if the city were his unfaithful wife. The city represents the people who live there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **You not only walked in their ways** - The way a person lives is spoken of as if the person were walking on a path. AT: "You not only acted like them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and copied their behavior and practices** - Here the words "behavior" and "practices" mean basically the same thing. AT: "and copied the things that they did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **As I live** - "As surely as I am alive." Yahweh uses this expression to show that what he says next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
