\v 17 Then they will sing a sad song about the city, like this:
\q1 'The famous city, in which many men who sailed on the seas lived,
\q2 is now no more!
\q1 The people of that city had great power as they sailed, but now they are at the bottom of the sea;
\q2 they terrified all the people living near them.
\q1
\v 18 But now everyone living along the coast is terrified because the enemy has destroyed the great city.
\q2 It is as though the land along the coast itself were trembling;
\q1 the people on the islands in the sea are terrified because that city exists no more.'

\v 17 They will lift up a lament for you and say to you,
\q How you, who were inhabited by sailors, have been destroyed. The famous city that was so strong—it is now gone from the sea.
\q The ones living in her once spread a terror about themselves upon everyone who lived near them.
\q
\v 18 Now the coasts tremble on the day of your downfall.
\q The islands in the sea are terrified, because you have died.'
