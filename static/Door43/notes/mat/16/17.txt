\v 17 Then Jesus said to him, "Simon, son of Jonah, God is pleased with you. What you just saidâ€”no human has revealed this to you. Instead, it was my Father who lives in heaven who has revealed this to you.
\v 18 I will also tell you this: You are Peter, which means 'rock.' You will be the support for the group of those who believe in me, like a large rock supports a great building. And even the powers of death will not be strong enough to stand up against it."

\v 17 Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood have not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
\v 18 I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church. The gates of Hades will not prevail against it.
