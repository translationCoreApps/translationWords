Whatever is true, whatever is worthy of respect, whatever is right, whatever is morally pure, whatever is pleasing, whatever is admirable, whatever is good, whatever \add deserves\add* praise, those are the things that you should continually think about.
\v 9 Those things that I have taught you and that you have received from me, those things that you have heard me \add say\add* and that you have seen me \add do\add*, those are the things that you yourselves should continually do. As a result \add of your doing those things\add*, God, the one who \add causes us to\add* have \add inner\add* peace, will be with\f + \ft Or: bless \f* you.

\v 8 Finally, my fellow believers, whatever is true, whatever is worthy for people to honor, whatever is right, whatever no one can find fault with, whatever is pleasing, whatever people should admire, whatever is good, whatever deserves people to praise it: these are the things that you should always be thinking about.
\v 9 Those things that I have taught you and that you have received from me, those things that you have heard me say and that you have seen me do, those are the things that you yourselves should always do. Then God, who gives us his peace, will be with you.

\v 8 Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is anything excellent, if there is anything to be praised, think about these things.
\v 9 The things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, do these things, and the God of peace will be with you.
