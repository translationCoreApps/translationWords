===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Two robbers were crucified with him** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The soldiers crucified two robbers with Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **shaking their heads** - They did this to make fun of Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross** - They did not believe that Jesus is the Son of God, so they wanted him to prove it if it was true. AT: "If you are the Son of God, prove it by coming down from the cross" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the Son of God** - This is an important title that describes the relationship between the Christ and the Son of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
