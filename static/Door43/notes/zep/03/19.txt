\q2 places where they had been disgraced.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will rescue the lame and gather up the outcast** - This appears to refer to lame and outcast sheep, which serve as an image of the Israelites who suffered in exile. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the lame** - This refers to people or animals that cannot walk. 
  * **I will make them as praise** - The full thought here is, "I will make them to be objects of praise," that is, "I will make them to be praised by others."
  * **At that time I will lead you; at that time I will gather you together** - These two lines mean basically the same thing and imply that Yahweh will bring the exiled people back to their homeland. AT: "At that time I will gather you together and lead you home." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
