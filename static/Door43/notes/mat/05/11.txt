<usfm>
\v 11 God is pleased with you when other people insult you, and he is honored when they do evil things to you and when they tells lies about you, saying that you are evil because you believe in me.
\v 12 When that happens, rejoice and be glad, because God will give you a great reward in heaven. Remember, that is how they persecuted the prophets who lived long ago.

\v 11 Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil things against you falsely for my sake.
\v 12 Rejoice and be very glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For in this way people persecuted the prophets who lived before you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus finishes describing the characteristics of people who are blessed. 

  * **Blessed are you** - The word "you" is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **say all kinds of evil things against you falsely** - "say all kinds of evil lies about you" or "say bad things about you that are not true"
  * **for my sake** - "because you follow me" or because you believe in me"
  * **Rejoice and be very glad** - "Rejoice" and "be very glad" mean almost the same thing. Jesus wanted his hearers not merely to rejoice but to do even more than rejoice if possible. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
