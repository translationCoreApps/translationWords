===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will make a horn sprout up for the house of Israel** - An animal horn represents the animal's strength, so horn is a metonym for strength. God speaks of making Israel strong as if Israel were an animal, and he were to cause its horn to grow. AT: "I will make the people of Israel strong" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. Here it refers to the people of Israel, the descendants of Jacob whom God called Israel. AT: "the people of Israel" or "the nation of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **speak in their midst** - "speak to them"
