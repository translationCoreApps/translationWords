\v 2 When the angels spoke God's law to the people of Israel, what they said was valid. God justly punished all who disobeyed him and violated his law.
\v 3 Since this is true, we will certainly not escape God; he will certainly judge us if we ignore the good news about how he saves us. It was the Lord Jesus who first told us about this, and the disciples who heard him have assured us that he did so.
\v 4 God also confirmed to us that this message was true by giving believers power to do mighty deeds that prove these things are true. And the Holy Spirit also gives many gifts to the believers, just as he desires to distribute them.

\v 2 For if the message that was spoken through the angels is valid, and every transgression and disobedience receives just punishment,
\v 3 how then can we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This is salvation that was first announced by the Lord and confirmed to us by those who heard it.
\v 4 At the same time God testified to it by signs, wonders, and various powerful deeds, and by distributing the gifts of the Holy Spirit according to his will.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For if the message that was spoken through the angels** - The Jews believed that God spoke his law to Moses through angels. This can be stated in active form. AT: "For if the message that God spoke through the angels" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For if the message** - The author is certain that these things are true. AT: "Because the message"
  * **is valid** - "is certain" or "is true"
  * **every transgression and disobedience receives just punishment** - Here "transgression" and "disobedience" stand for the people who are guilty of these sins. AT: "every person who sins and disobeys will receive just punishment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **transgression and disobedience** - These two words mean basically the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **how then can we escape if we ignore so great a salvation?** - The author uses a question to emphasize that the people will certainly receive punishment if they refuse God's salvation through Christ. AT: "then God will certainly punish us if we do not pay attention to his message about how God will save us!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **ignore** - "do not care for" or "consider unimportant"
  * **This is salvation that was first announced by the Lord** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The Lord himself first announced the message about how God will save us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **and confirmed to us by those who heard it** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "and then those who heard the message confirmed it to us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **according to his will** - "in just the way he wanted to do it"
