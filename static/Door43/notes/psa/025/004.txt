===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Make known to me your ways, Yahweh; teach me your paths** - Both statements mean the same thing. God teaching a person how they should behave is spoken of as if he were showing a person the correct path on which a person should travel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I hope in you** - "I depend on you" or "I wait patiently for you"
  * **Guide me into your truth and teach me** - Guide and teach mean the same thing, to give instruction. AT: "Instruct me to conduct my life by obeying your truth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the God of my salvation** - The abstract noun "salvation" can be stated as "saves." AT: "the one who saves me" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
