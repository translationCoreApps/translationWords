\v 6 You will hear about wars \add that are close\add* and wars that are far away, but do not let that trouble you. Keep in mind that \add God has said that\add* those things must happen. But \add when they happen\add*, it will not mean that the end \add of the world\add* has come!
\v 7 \add Groups in various\add* countries will fight each other, and \add various\add* governments \add will also fight\add* against each other. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
\v 8 These things will happen first. Then there will be other things that \add will happen before I return. What will happen will be as painful as\add* birth pains \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

\v 7 People groups will attack each other, and kings will lead armies against each other. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
\v 8 These things will happen first, but they will be like when a woman starts to suffer pain before she gives birth to a child.

\v 6 You will hear of wars and reports of wars. See that you are not troubled, for these things must happen; but the end is not yet.
\v 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
\v 8 But all these things are only the beginning of birth pains.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **See that you are not troubled** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Do not let these things trouble you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom** - Both of these mean the same thing. Jesus is emphasizing that people everywhere will fight each other. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the beginning of birth pains** - This refers to the pains a woman feels before giving birth to a child. This metaphor means these wars, famines, and earthquakes are just the beginning of the events that will lead to the end of the age. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
