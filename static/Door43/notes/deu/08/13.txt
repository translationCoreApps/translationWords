<usfm>
\v 13 Indeed, when the number of your cattle and sheep has greatly increased, and when you have accumulated a large amount of silver and gold, and the amount of all your other possessions has greatly increased,
\v 14 be sure that you do not become proud and forget Yahweh our God, who rescued your ancestors from being slaves in Egypt and brought them out from there.

<usfm>
\v 13 Be careful when your herds and flocks multiply and when your silver and gold increase, and all that you have is multiplied,
\v 14 then your heart becomes lifted up and you forget Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
