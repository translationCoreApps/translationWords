\v 17 Then the seventh angel poured out into the air what was contained in his bowl. As a result, someone said with a loud voice from the throne in the very holy place, "The time for God to punish rebellious people is finished."
\v 18 When the angel emptied his bowl, lightning flashed, there were rumblings and thunder, and the earth shook. It shook more violently than it had ever shaken since people first lived on earth.
\v 19 As a result, the very large city split into three parts. God also destroyed the cities in the other nations. God did not forget that the people of Babylon had sinned very much. So he made them drink a cup of the wine that made them suffer because he was angry with them.

\v 17 Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. Then a loud voice came out of the temple and from the throne, saying, "It is done!"
\v 18 There were flashes of lightning, rumbles, crashes of thunder, and a terrible earthquakeâ€”an earthquake greater than any that has ever happened since human beings have been on the earth, so great was this earthquake.
\v 19 The great city was split into three parts, and the nations' cities collapsed. Then God called to mind Babylon the great, and he gave that city the cup filled with the wine made from his furious wrath.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The seventh angel pours out the seventh bowl of God's wrath.

  * **poured out his bowl** - The word "bowl" refers to what is in it. AT: "poured out the wine from his bowl" or "poured out God's wrath from his bowl." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:16:02|16:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Then a loud voice came out of the temple and from the throne** - This means someone sitting on the throne or someone standing near the throne spoke loudly. It is unclear who is speaking. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **flashes of lightning** - Use your language's way of describing what lightning looks like each time it appears. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:04:04|4:5]].
  * **rumbles, crashes of thunder** - These are the loud noises that thunder makes. Use your language's way of describing the sound of thunder. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:04:04|4:5]].
  * **The great city was split** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The earthquake split the great city" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Then God called to mind** - "Then God remembered" or "Then God thought of" or "Then God started to pay attention to." This does not mean that God remembered something he had forgotten.
  * **he gave that city the cup filled with the wine made from his furious wrath** - The wine is a symbol of his wrath. Making people drink it is a symbol of punishing them. AT: "he made the people of that city drink the wine that represents his wrath" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
