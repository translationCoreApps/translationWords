\v 22 When Jesus said these things, one of the temple guards standing near him struck him hard with his hand. He said, "That is not the right way to answer the high priest."
\v 23 Jesus replied to him, "If I had said something wrong, tell me what it was. However, if what I said was right, you should not slap me!"
\v 24 Then Annas sent Jesus, who was still tied up, to Caiaphas the high priest.

\v 22 When Jesus had said this, one of the officers standing there gave Jesus a punch and said, "Is that how you answer the high priest?"
\v 23 Jesus answered him, "If I spoke wrongly, testify about the wrong, but if rightly, why do you hit me?"
\v 24 Then Annas sent him tied up to Caiaphas the high priest.
