\v 6 For you have demanded guarantee of a loan from your brother for no reason,
\q and you have stripped away clothing from the naked.
\q
\v 7 You have not given water to weary people to drink;
\q you have withheld bread from hungry people
\q
\v 8 although you, a mighty man, possessed the earth,
\q although you, an honored man, lived in it.
