===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 When the Israelite people bring to me a tenth of all \add the crops and of their newborn animals\add*, I will give that to you descendants of Levi. That will be your payment for the work you do at the Sacred Tent.
\v 22 The other Israelites must not go near that tent. If they go near it, \add I will consider that their doing that is a sin\add*, and they will die for committing that sin.

\v 21 To the descendants of Levi, look, I have given all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the service that they provide in working at the tent of meeting.
\v 22 From now on the people of Israel must not come near the tent of meeting, or they will be responsible for this sin and die.
