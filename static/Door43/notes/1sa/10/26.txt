\v 26 When Saul returned to his home in the town of Gibeah, a group of courageous men decided to continually accompany Saul. They did that because God motivated them to do that.
\v 27 But some worthless men said, "How can this man save us from our enemies?" They despised him and refused to give him any gifts to show that they would be loyal to him. But Saul did not say anything to rebuke them.

\v 26 Saul also went to his home at Gibeah, and with him went some strong men, whose hearts God had touched.
\v 27 But some worthless men said, "How can this man save us?" These people despised Saul and did not bring him any gifts. But Saul kept silent.
\f + \ft Some modern versions add to this verse the following paragraph: \fqa Nahash king of the Ammonites had severely oppressed the Gadites and Reubenites. He dug out the right eye of each man and did not allow anyone to rescue Israel. Across the Jordan River was left no Israelites whose right eye Nahash king of the Ammonites had not dug out. But seven thousand men had escaped from the Ammonites and had gone into Jabesh Gilead. \fqb \f*
