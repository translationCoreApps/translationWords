  * **How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel?** - This rhetorical question is a rebuke from God and can be translated as a statement. AT: "Stop mourning that I rejected Saul from being king over Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Fill your horn with oil** - The term "horn" was sometimes used to refer to a "flask" that was shaped like a horn and was used for holding water or oil. A flask of oil was used for anointing a king.
