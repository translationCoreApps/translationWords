\v 11 But, my fellow believers, \add although someone claims that I am proclaiming that men must be circumcised, I certainly am not still proclaiming that. Remember that the Jews are still\add* \add persecuting me\f + \ft Or: causing me to suffer\add* \f*. If I were still proclaiming that men must be circumcised \add in order for God to accept them\add*, the Jews would not be persecuting me.\f + \ft Or: why would the Jews be persecuting me? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add They would\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* not be \add persecuting me\add*, Or: causing me to suffer \add because\add* then \add the Jews\add* would no longer be offended. \add They\add* \add are offended\f + \ft Or: do not want to accept what I teach\add* \f* \add because I proclaim that Christ, the Messiah, died on\add* the cross \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 12 I \add would even\add* wish that those who are disturbing you \add by insisting that men be circumcised\add* would also emasculate \f + \ft euphemism \f* themselves, \add with the result that they would be expelled from your congregations\add*!

\v 11 But, my fellow believers, maybe someone is saying that I still teach that you must let them circumcise you. I certainly taught that before I followed Christ, but I am not teaching that any longer. But what they are saying cannot be true; otherwise, no one would be persecuting me now. No, I tell you that if people think they have to be circumcised to follow Christ, then the fact that Christ died on the cross no longer make any difference to them.
\v 12 I wish that those who are confusing you would go all the way and castrate themselves!

\v 11 Brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.
\v 12 As for those who are disturbing you, I wish they would castrate themselves!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still being persecuted?** - Paul is describing a situation that does not exist to emphasize that people are persecuting him because he is not preaching that people need to become Jews. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Brothers, you can see that I am not still proclaiming circumcision because the Jews are persecuting me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **Brothers** - Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:gal:01:01|1:2]].
  * **In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been removed** - Paul is describing a situation that does not exist to emphasize that people persecute him because he is preaching that God forgives people because of Jesus' work on the cross. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **In that case** - "If I were still saying that people need to become Jews"
  * **the stumbling block of the cross has been removed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the teaching about the cross has no stumbling block" or "there is nothing in the teaching of the cross that would cause people to stumble" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the stumbling block of the cross has been removed** - Stumbling represents sinning, and a stumbling block represents something that causes people to sin. In this case the sin is to reject the truth of the teaching that in order to be made right with God, people only need to believe that Jesus died on the cross for us. AT: "the teaching about the cross that causes people to reject the truth has been removed" or "there is nothing in the teaching about Jesus dying on the cross that would lead people to reject the teaching" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **castrate themselves** - Possible meanings are 1) literal, to cut off their male organs so as to become eunuchs or 2) metaphorical, completely withdraw from the Christian community. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
