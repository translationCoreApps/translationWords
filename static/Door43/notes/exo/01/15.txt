\v 15 Now there were two Hebrew midwives. Their names were Shiphrah and Puah. The king of Egypt said to those two women,
\v 16 "When you help the Hebrew women give birth to their children, if the baby is a boy, you must kill him. If the baby is a girl, you may let her live."
\v 17 But the midwives feared that God would punish them if they obeyed the king. So they did not do what the king told them to do. They allowed the baby boys to live.

\p
\v 15 Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives; the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the other Puah.
\v 16 He said, "When you assist the Hebrew women on the birthstool, observe when they give birth. If it is a son, then you must kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she may live."
\v 17 But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt ordered them; instead, they let the baby boys live.
