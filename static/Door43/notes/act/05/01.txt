===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Continuing the story of how the new Christians shared their belongings with other believers, Luke tells about two believers, Ananias and Sapphria. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline to tell a new part of the story.
  * **his wife also knew it** - "his wife also knew that he kept back part of the sale money"
  * **laid it at the apostles' feet** - This means that they presented to money to the apostles. AT: "presented it to the apostles" or "gave it to the apostles." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:act:04:34|4:35]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
