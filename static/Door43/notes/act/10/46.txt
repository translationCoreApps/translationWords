\v 46 The Jewish believers knew that God had done that because they were hearing those people speaking languages that they had not learned and telling how great God is. Then Peter said
\v 47 to the other Jewish believers who were there, "God has given them the Holy Spirit just like he gave him to us Jewish believers, so surely all of you would agree that we should baptize these people!"
\v 48 Then Peter told those non-Jewish people that they should be baptized as believers in Jesus Christ. So they baptized all of them. After they were baptized, they requested that Peter stay with them several days. So Peter and the other Jewish believers did that.

\v 46 For they heard these Gentiles speak in other languages and praising God. Then Peter answered,
\v 47 "Can anyone keep water from these people so they should not be baptized, these people who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?"
\v 48 Then he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay with them for several days.
