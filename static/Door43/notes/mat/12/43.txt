\v 43 "\add Sometimes\add* when an evil spirit leaves a person, it wanders around in desolate areas, seeking \add someone in whom it can\add* rest. If it does not find anyone,
\v 44 it says \add to itself\add*, 'I will return to the person \f + \ft metaphor \f* in whom I used to live.' So it goes back \add and finds that the Spirit of God is not in control of that\add* person's \add life. The person's life is like\add* a house that has been swept clean and everything put in order \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add but it is\add* empty.
\v 45 Then \add this evil spirit\add* goes and gets seven other spirits that are \add even\add* more evil, and they \add all\add* enter \add that person\add* and \add begin\add* living there. \add So, although\add* that person's condition \add was bad\add* before, it becomes much worse. That is what \add you\add* wicked people who \add have heard me teach\add* will experience."

\v 43 "Sometimes when an evil spirit leaves a person, it wanders around in desolate areas, seeking someone in whom he can rest. If he does not find anyone,
\v 44 he says to itself, 'I will return to the person in whom I used to live.' So he goes back and finds that the Spirit of God is not in control of that person's life. The person's life is like a house that has been swept clean and everything put in order, but it is empty.
\v 45 Then this evil spirit goes and gets seven other spirits that are even more evil, and they all enter that person and begin living there. So although that person's condition was bad before, it becomes much worse. That is what you wicked people who have heard me teach will experience."

\v 43 When an unclean spirit has gone away from a man, it passes through waterless places and looks for rest, but does not find it.
\v 44 Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' Having returned, it finds that house swept out and put in order.
\v 45 Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all come in to live there. Then the final condition of that man becomes worse than the first. It will be just like that with this evil generation."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to rebuke the scribes and Pharisees.

  * **When an unclean spirit ... with this evil generation** - Jesus tells a parable to warn the people of the danger of not believing him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])
  * **waterless places** - "dry places" or "places where no people live"
  * **does not find it** - Here "it" refers to rest. 
  * **Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.'** - This can be translated as a statement rather than a quotation. AT: "So, the unclean spirit decides to return to the house from which it came"
  * **to my house from which I came** - This is a metaphor for the person in whom the unclean spirit was living. AT: "to the place I left" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **it finds that house swept out and put in order** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the unclean spirit finds that someone has swept the house clean and has put everything in the house where it belongs" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **that house swept out and put in order** - Again, "house" is a metaphor for the person in whom the unclean spirit was living. Here, "swept out and put in order" suggests that no one is living in the house. Jesus means when an unclean spirit leaves a person, the person must invite the Holy Spirit to live in him or else the demon will come back. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **It will be just like that with this evil generation** - This means that if the people of Jesus' generation do not believe him and become his disciples, they will be in a worse situation than they were before he came.
