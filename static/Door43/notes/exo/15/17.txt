  * **You will bring them** - Where God would bring them can be stated clearly. Since Moses was not already in Canaan, some languages would use "take" rather than "bring." AT: "You will take your people to Canaan" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_go]])
  * **plant them on the mountain** - Moses speaks about God giving his people the land to live in as if they were a tree that God was planting. AT: "settle them on the mountain" or "let them live on the mountain" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the mountain of your inheritance** - This refers to Mount Zion in the land of Canaan.
  * **of your inheritance** - Moses speaks about God promising to give his people the mountain forever as if he were giving it to them as an inheritance. AT: "that you have given them as an inheritance" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **that your hands have built** - The phrase "your hands" refers to God's power. AT: "that you have built by your power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])
