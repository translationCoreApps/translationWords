===== translationNotes: =====

  * **went out from the presence of Yahweh** - Even though Yahweh is everywhere, this idiom speaks of Cain as though he went far away. AT: "went away from where Yahweh spoke to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Nod** - Translators may add a footnote saying "The word Nod means 'wandering.'"
  * **slept with** - Your language may have a way of saying this politely. Some older versions say "knew." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:04:01|4:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **He built a city** - "Cain built a city"
