  * **against everyone who is proud and raised up, and against everyone who is arrogant** - The words "proud, "raised up," and "arrogant" all mean the same thing. AT: "against every person who is proud" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **and he will be brought down** - "and every proud person will be brought down." This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will humble him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **against all the cedars of Lebanon ... against all the oaks of Bashan** - "day of Yahweh of Hosts" will be against the cedars and oaks. Possible meanings are 1) these trees refer to the proud people that God will judge or 2) God will actually destroy these mighty trees.
