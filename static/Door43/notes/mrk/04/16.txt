\v 16 \add Some people are like the ground where the soil was not very deep over\add* the rock. When they hear \add God's\add* message, they immediately accept it with joy.
\v 17 But, because \add the message does not penetrate deeply\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add into their hearts\f + \ft Or: inner \f* beings, they\add* believe it for \add only a short time. They are like the plants that\add* did not have deep roots. When others treat such people badly or cause them to suffer because \add they believe\add*, those people \add who are suffering\add* soon stop believing God's message.

\v 16 Some people are like the ground where the soil was not very deep over the rock. When they hear God's message, they immediately accept it with joy.
\v 17 But, because the message does not grow deep, they believe it for only a short time. They are like the plants that did not have deep roots. When others treat them badly or cause them to suffer because they believed God's message, those people who are suffering soon stop believing God's message.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 And some are the ones that are sown on rocky ground, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy.
\v 17 And they have no root in themselves, but endure for a short time. Then tribulation or persecution comes because of the word, and immediately they stumble.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **And some are the ones** - "And some people are like the seeds." Jesus begins to explain how some people are like the seeds that fell on the rocky soil. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **And they have no root in themselves** - This is a comparison to the young plants that have very shallow roots. This metaphor means that the people were first excited when they received the word, but they were not strongly devoted to it. AT: "And they are like the young plants that have no roots" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **no roots** - This is a hyperbole, an exaggeration, emphasizing how the roots were very shallow. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **endure** - In this parable, "endure" means "believe." AT: "continue in their belief" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **because of the word** - It may be helpful to explain why tribulation comes. It came because people believed the word.  AT: "because they believed the word" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **they stumble** - In this parable, "stumble" means "stop believing in God's message" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
