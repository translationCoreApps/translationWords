\v 9 The king will direct the soldiers who operate the rams to batter the wall, and those who will use iron bars to tear down the towers in the wall.
\v 10 The king will have a huge number of horses, and the stamping of their hooves will raise dust to cover the whole city. It will be as though the walls tremble because of the noise made by the horses, the supply wagons, and the chariots when they enter the city where the enemy has broken down the walls.
\v 11 The horses will trample all of the streets of the city with their hooves. The soldiers will kill the people with their swords; they will cause the monuments that celebrated their strength to collapse.

\v 9 He will place his battering rams to hit against your walls, and his tools will tear down your towers.
\v 10 His horses will be so many that their dust will cover you. Your walls will shake with the sound of horsemen, wagons, and chariots. When he enters your gates, he will enter as men come into a city whose walls have been broken down. 
\v 11 The hoofs of his horses will trample all of your streets. He will kill your people with the sword and your mighty stone pillars will fall to the ground.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Tyre.
  * **General Information:** - The words "he" and "his" in these verses refer to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and represent the soldiers in Nebuchadnezzar's army doing these actions. The word "your" refers to the city of Tyre. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **He will place his battering rams to hit against your walls, and his tools will tear down your towers** - Although the battering rams and tools are spoken of as acting against the walls and towers of Tyre, they would have been used by the soldiers in Nebuchadnezzar's army against the walls and towers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **battering rams** - "Battering rams" are large trees or poles that many men in an army would pick up and hit against a wall or door so they could break it down and get inside. Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:01|4:2]].
  * **tools** - Weapons or instruments made of iron used to tear down the towers
  * **When he enters your gates, he will enter as men come into a city whose walls have been broken down** - Here Yahweh uses a simile to describe how Nebuchadnezzar's army will enter into the city of Tyre. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **whose walls have been broken down** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "after breaking down its walls" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
