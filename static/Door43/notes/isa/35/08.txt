\v 8 And there will be a highway through that land;

\q1 People who are not acceptable to God will not walk on that road;
\q2 it will be only for those who conduct their lives as God wants them to,
\q2 and not even foolish people will become lost while walking on that road.
\q1
\v 9 There will not be any lions there
\q2 or any other dangerous animals along that road.
\q1 Only those who have been freed \add from being slaves in Babylonia\add* will walk on it.
