\v 7 Therefore, I will use my power against you, and I will enable other nations to conquer you and take you away like any other possessions of yours. I will destroy you completely, and you will no longer be one of the nations. When that happens, people will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.'"

\v 6 For the Lord Yahweh says this: You have clapped your hands and stamped your feet, and rejoiced with all the contempt within you against the land of Israel.
\v 7 Therefore, behold! I will strike you with my hand and give you as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and make you perish from among the countries! I will destroy you, and you will know that I am Yahweh.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You have clapped your hands and stamped your feet** - These actions are ways to show strong emotions. In this case they people are cheering and showing their contempt against Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **all the contempt within you against the land of Israel** - Here the "land of Israel" represents of the people who live there. AT: "with all of the hatred you feel towards the people who live in Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **behold** - "indeed." The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows.
  * **I will strike you with my hand** - "I will hit you with my powerful hand." Here Yahweh speaks of punishing the people as if he were literally hitting them with his hand. AT: "I will punish you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **give you as plunder to the nations** - The word "you" refers to the people of Ammon but is also a metonym for their land and their possessions. AT: "I will allow enemies to defeat you and take you, your land, and your possessions as plunder" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will cut you off from the peoples ... make you perish from among the countries** - These phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize Yahweh will completely destroy the people of Ammon so that they are no longer a nation. AT: "I will completely destroy you so that you are no longer a nation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
