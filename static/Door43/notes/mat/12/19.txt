===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 He will not quarrel \add with people\add*, neither will he shout. He will not \add teach with\add* a loud voice in the \add main\add* streets.
\v 20 Until he has justly judged \add the people who trust in him and\add* has declared them not guilty, he will not destroy \add anyone who is weak like\add* a smashed stalk \f + \ft metaphor \f*, nor will he silence \add anyone who is helpless like\add* a smoldering \add linen\add* wick \f + \ft metaphor, doublet \f*.
\v 21 As a result, the non-Jews will confidently expect \add that he will do great things for them\add*.

\v 19 He will not quarrel with people, neither will he shout.
\q And he will not shout in the streets.

\q
\v 20 He will be gentle with the weak people;
\q If a person is barely alive, he will not kill him.
\q And he will judge the people with justice and declare that they are not guilty.
\q
\v 21 So the non-Jews will confidently trust in him."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Matthew continues to quote the prophet Isaiah.

  * **neither will anyone hear his voice in** - Here "voice" refers to the whole person. AT: "And he will not speak loudly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **his ... He** - All occurrences of these words refer to God's chosen servant.
  * **in the streets** - This is an idiom that means "publicly." AT: "in the cities and towns" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **He will not break any bruised reed; he will not quench any smoking flax** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. They are metaphors emphasizing that God's servant will be gentle and kind. Both "bruised reed" and "smoking flax" represent weak and hurting people. If the metaphor is confusing, you could translate the literal meaning. AT: "He will be kind to weak people, and he will be gentle to those who are hurting" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **bruised reed** - "damaged plant"
  * **he will not quench** - "he will not put out"
  * **smoking flax** - This refers to a lamp wick after the flame has gone out and when it is only smoking.
  * **flax, until** - This can be translated with a new sentence: "flax. This is what he will do until"
  * **he leads justice to victory** - "until he succeeds in bringing my justice and salvation to the people." The meaning of the abstract noun "judgment" can be translated as "just" or "save." AT: "the people know that I am just, and I will save them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **in his name** - Here "name" refers to the whole person. AT: "in him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
