\v 7 Jehoahaz had only fifty men who rode on horses and ten chariots and 10,000 other soldiers, because the army of Syria had killed all the rest, walking over them like people walk on dirt.

\v 6 Nevertheless, they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who caused Israel to sin, and they continued in them. And the Asherah pole remained in Samaria.
\v 7 The Arameans left Jehoahaz with only fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen, for the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the chaff at threshing time.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam** - AT: "Israel continued to commit the same sins as Jeroboam had"
  * **had destroyed them** - AT "the king of the Arameans defeated the army of Jehoahaz" 
  * **made them like the chaff at threshing time** - their destruction was so great, what remained of their army was so small and insignificant that it is compared to wheat chaff that is worthless and easily blown away. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
