=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter has two stories: David's last advice to Solomon and Solomon's punishment of those who supported Adonijah and also Shimei, who had cursed David when David was fleeing from Absalom. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:curse]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Exalting oneself ==
Exalting oneself can lead to disaster as when Adonijah made himself king. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:exalt]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Euphemism ==
David spoke of his impending death using a euphemism: "I am going the way of all the earth." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Parallelism ==

David wanted to emphasize the importance of obeying God to his son Solomon. He used parallelism, saying the same thing seven times using different words: "Keep the commands of Yahweh your God to walk in his ways, to obey his statutes, his commandments, his decisions, and his covenant decrees, being careful to do what is written in the law of Moses." Some languages have other ways of emphasizing an idea. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
