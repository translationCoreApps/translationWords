===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Who knows the intensity of your anger, and your wrath that is equal to the fear of you?** - The writer uses a question to emphasize that no one has fully experienced God anger. Therefore no one truly reveres God and fears his anger when people sin. AT: "No one knows the intensity of your anger. Therefore no one fears your wrath when they sin." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Turn back, Yahweh! How long will it be?** - Asking Yahweh to no longer be angry is spoken of as if the writer wants God to turn physically away from his anger. AT: "Yahweh, please do not be angry any longer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **How long will it be?** - The writer uses a question to state that he wants God to stop being angry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Have pity on your servants** - Here "your servants" refers to the people of Israel. AT: "Be merciful to us, your servants"
