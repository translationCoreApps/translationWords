===== translationNotes: =====

  * **gather yourselves together** - "gather yourselves together for battle." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Yahweh, bring down your mighty warriors** - In the middle of this message to Israel's enemies, this sentence is addressed to Yahweh. Perhaps this was to make their enemies afraid of Yahweh's army. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
