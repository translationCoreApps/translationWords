== Rhetorical Questions ==
This chapter begins with a number of rhetorical questions. The last question provides the reader with some answers: "Yahweh certainly spoken through his prophets. So listen to them."  The answer to these rhetorical questions have the expected response of "no" because they are things that are not expected to happen. The writer is helping the reader to conclude that God uses the prophets to speak his message.
