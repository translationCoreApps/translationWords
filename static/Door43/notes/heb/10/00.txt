====== Hebrews 10 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter discusses how life as a Christian is superior to life as a Jew under the law of Moses and how the sacrifice of Jesus was superior to the sacrifices offered in the Temple. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]])

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 10:5-7, 6-17, 37-38, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== God's judgment and reward==
Holy living is important for Christians. God will hold people accountable for how they lived their Christian life. Even though there will not be eternal condemnation for Christians, ungodly actions do and will have consequences. In addition, faithful living will be rewarded. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:holy]], [[:en:obe:kt:ungodly]], [[:en:obe:kt:faithful]] and [[:en:obe:kt:reward]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins" ==
The sacrifices themselves had no redeeming power. They were effective because they were a display of faith, which was credited to the person offering the sacrifice. It was ultimately the sacrifice of Jesus which then makes these sacrifices "take away sins." In turn, God does not want sacrifices offered devoid of faith. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:redeem]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])

== "The covenant that I will make" ==
It is unclear whether this prophecy is being fulfilled when the author is speaking or whether it is still future. The translator should try to avoid making a claim about the time this covenant begins. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]])
