===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do nothing out of selfishness or empty conceit** - "You are no better than others, so do not serve yourselves or think of yourselves as better than others"
  * **Do not look out for your own needs** - This is an idiom and an exaggeration. AT: "Do not think only about how to get the things you need" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
