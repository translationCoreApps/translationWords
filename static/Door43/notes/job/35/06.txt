\q1
\v 7 And if you are righteous, does that help God?
\q2 No, he is not benefited by anything that you do \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1
\v 8 It is other people who suffer because of the wicked things that you do,
\q2 but by doing good deeds for people, you help them.

\v 6 If you have sinned, that cannot harm God at all.
\q2 Even if you do wrong things many, many times, that certainly does not hurt him.

\v 7 In the same way, if you are righteous, does that help God?
\q2 No, nothing you do can help him.

\q
\v 6 If you have sinned, what harm do you do to God?
\q If your transgressions pile up high, what do you do to him?
\q
\v 7 If you are righteous, what can you give to him?
\q What will he receive from your hand?
\q
\v 8 Your wickedness may hurt a man, as you are a man,
\q and your righteousness might benefit another son of man.

===== translationNotes: =====
  * **Connecting Statement:** - Elihu continues speaking.

  * **If you have sinned, what harm do you do to God?** - AT: "All of your many sins cannot harm the person or character of God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If your transgressions pile up high, what do you do to him?** - This question repeats the same idea as the previous question. AT: "Though you sin continually and with huge results, your sins have no effect on him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **If you are righteous, what can you give to him? What will he receive from your hand?** - The two questions mean basically the same thing, that Job's righteousness adds nothing to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **from your hand** - AT: "from you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **son of man** - "fellow human-being " or "another person"
