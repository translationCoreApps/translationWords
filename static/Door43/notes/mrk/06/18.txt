\v 18 After that, John kept telling Herod, "God's law does not permit you to marry the wife of your brother while he is still alive." Then, because Herodias urged him to put John in prison, Herod himself sent soldiers to John. They arrested John and put him in prison.
\v 19 But because Herodias wanted to get further revenge on John, she wanted someone to execute him. But she could not do that because while John was in prison, Herod kept John safe from her.
\v 20 Herod did this because he respected John, because he knew that he was a righteous man who devoted himself to God. Whenever Herod listened to him, he became very disturbed and did not know what he should do with him, but he liked to listen to him.

<usfm>
\v 18 For John told Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
\v 19 But Herodias held on to anger against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not,
\v 20 for Herod feared John; he knew that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. Listening to him made him greatly upset, yet he heard him gladly.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **wanted to kill him, but she could not** - Herodias is the subject of this phrase and "she" is a metonym as she wants someone else to execute John. AT: "she wanted someone to kill him, but she could not have him killed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for Herod feared John; he knew** - These two clauses can be linked differently to show more clearly why Herod feared John. AT: "for Herod feared John because he knew" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_connectingwords]])
  * **he knew that he was a righteous** - "Herod knew that John was a righteous"
  * **Listening to him** - "Listening to John"
