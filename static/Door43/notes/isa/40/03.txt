\q2 flatten every hill and every mountain.
\q1 Make the uneven ground smooth,
\q2 and make the rough places smooth.
\q1
\v 5 If you do that, it will become known that Yahweh is glorious\f + \ft Or: great \f*,
\q2 and all people will realize it at the same time.

\q1 "In the wilderness prepare the way of Yahweh;
\q1 make straight in the Arabah a highway for our God."
