====== Isaiah 56 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Gentiles ==
Many scholars believe this chapter prophesies that Gentiles will be able to come to a saving faith in Yahweh. At this time, the Israelites believed that only an Israelite could be saved. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:save]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Beasts ==
The Israelites are compared to beasts and dogs in this chapter. This would have been very offensive to them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
