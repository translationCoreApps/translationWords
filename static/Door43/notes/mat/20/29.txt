\v 30 And two blind men were sitting by the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us."
\v 31 The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be quiet, but they cried out even more loudly, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This begins an account of Jesus healing two blind men.

  * **As they went** - This refers to the disciples and Jesus.
  * **followed him** - "followed Jesus"
  * **And two blind men were sitting** - This is sometimes translated as "Behold, there were two men sitting." The writer is alerting us to a new people in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **When they heard** - "When the two blind men heard"
  * **was passing by** - "was walking by them"
  * **Son of David** - Jesus was not David's literal son, so this may be translated as "Descendant of King David" (UDB). However, "Son of David" is also a title for the Messiah, and the men were probably calling Jesus by this title.
  * **they cried out all the more** - "the blind men shouted more than before" or "they shouted louder"
