\v 3 Therefore, wash yourself, anoint yourself, put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he finishes eating and drinking.
\f + \ft The Hebrew text has, \fqa Put on your best piece of clothing. \fqb However, a marginal note instructs readers to read, \fqa Put on your best clothes. \fqb Translators are free to choose for themselves. \f* 
\v 4 And make sure, when he lies down, that you remember the place where he lies down so that later you can go to him, uncover his feet, and lie down there. Then he will tell you what to do."
\v 5 Ruth said to Naomi, "I will do everything you say."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **anoint yourself** - This is probably a reference to rubbing sweet-smelling oil on oneself, much as women put on perfume today.
  * **go down to the threshing floor** - This refers to leaving the city and heading to the threshing area. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **uncover his feet** - This means to remove the cloak or blanket covering his feet so that they would be exposed to the cold. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **lie down there** - "lie down at his feet"
  * **Then he will tell you what to do** - The specific custom of that time is unclear, but this is usually understood as a culturally acceptable way for a woman to tell a man that she was willing to marry him. Boaz would understand the custom and accept or reject her offer.
  * **Then he will** - "When he wakes up, he will"
