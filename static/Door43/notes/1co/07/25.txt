\v 25 Now \add I will answer your question\add* about women who have never married. There is nothing that the Lord has commanded me \add to write about them\add*, but I am writing this to tell you what I think \add is best\add*, because the Lord \add Jesus\add* has mercifully enabled what I \add say\add* to be reliable.
\v 26 There are a lot of distressing events \add happening\add* now \f + \ft Or: that will soon happen \f*, so I think that it is better for people to remain in the status that they now have.

\v 25 Regarding the question about those who have never married, I will give my views, but I have no specific commandment from the Lord on this question. But you can have confidence in my reply because God has been kind to me and enabled me to be someone whom people can trust.
\v 26 Therefore, because of the difficult times that seem to be coming upon us all, I think it is good for you to remain as you were when God called you.

\v 25 Now concerning those who never married, I have no commandment from the Lord. But I give my opinion as one who, by the Lord's mercy, is trustworthy.
\v 26 Therefore, I think that because of the impending crisis, it is good for a man to remain as he is.
