====== Isaiah 35 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Reign of the Messiah ==
This chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the messiah will reign. It pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator does not need to add an explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:restore]], [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:christ]])
