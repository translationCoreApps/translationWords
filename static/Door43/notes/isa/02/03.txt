===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah speaks to the people of Judah in the form of a poem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Jacob, so he may teach ... and we may walk** - Another possible meaning is "Jacob. He will teach ... and we will walk"
  * **he may teach us some of his ways, and we may walk in his paths** - The words "ways" and "paths" are metaphors for the way a person lives. If your language has only one word for the ground on which people walk, you may combine these phrases. AT: "he may teach us his will so that we may obey him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For out of Zion will go the law, and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem** - These phrases mean the same thing. Isaiah was emphasizing that all nations will understand that the truth is found in Jerusalem. AT: "People in Zion will teach God's law, and people in Jerusalem will teach the word of Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **For out of Zion will go the law** - "For the law will go out from Zion." Isaiah speaks as if the law were something like a river that moves without people doing anything. AT: "Those to whom they teach the law will go out from Zion" or "Yahweh will proclaim his law from Zion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem** - "the word of Yahweh will go out from Jerusalem." Isaiah speaks as if the word of Yahweh were something like a river that moves without people doing anything. You can make clear the understood information. AT: "Those to whom they teach the word of Yahweh will go out from Jerusalem" or "Yahweh will proclaim his word from Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
