===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 And \add make sure of it\add* because you are spiritually complete because you have a close relationship with Christ, who rules over every being that rules.
\v 11 Specifically, because of your close relationship with him, it is as though \f + \ft metaphor \f* you were circumcised \f + \ft Or:Christ circumcised you \f* \add spiritually\add*. This does not mean that someone circumcised you physically \f + \ft metonymy \f*, but it means that Christ completely removed your entire self-directed nature.
\v 12 And specifically, when you were baptized, \add it was as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* you \add had died and\add* were buried with Christ, and \add it was as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* God caused you to live again with Christ as a result of your believing that God acted powerfully, specifically, by your believing that God raised Christ from among dead people.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Now God has given you everything you need because he has joined you to Christ, and he rules over every other person, spirit, and angel.
\v 11 It is as if God has also circumcised you. But he did not remove any flesh from you. Instead, Jesus caused you to not have to sin any longer. It is as if he had cut away your old self that loved to sin.
\v 12 Because they have baptized you, God considers that when men buried Christ, they buried you along with him. He considers that when he made Christ come alive again, he made you come alive also, because you trusted that he could make you live again.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 And you are filled in him. He is the head of every power and authority.
\v 11 In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not done by humans in the removal of the body of flesh, but in the circumcision of Christ.
\v 12 You were buried with him in baptism. And in him you were raised up through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead ones.
