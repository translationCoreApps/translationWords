\v 17 Then he said to the man, "You heeded what your wife said, and you ate some of the fruit \add of the tree\add* concerning which I commanded you saying, 'Do not eat it.' So I will make it difficult \add to grow things in\add* the ground because of what you did. You will have to work hard as long as you live to produce things from the ground to eat.
\v 18 Thornbushes and thistle plants and other weeds will grow \add and prevent what you have planted from growing\add*. And for food, you will have to eat things that just grow in your fields.
\v 19 \add All your life\add* you will sweat as you work hard to produce food to eat. Then you will die \f + \ft euphemism \f*, and your \add body will be buried\add* in the ground. I made you from soil, so, since I made your body from soil, when you \add die and are buried your body will decay\add* and become soil again."

\v 17 To Adam he said, 
\q "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, 
\q and have eaten from the tree, concerning which I commanded you, 
\q saying, 'You may not eat from it,' 
\q cursed is the ground because of you; 
\q in painful toil you will eat from it all the days of your life. 
\q
\v 18 It will produce thorns and thistles for you, 
\q and you will eat the plants of the field.
\q
\v 19 By the sweat of your face you will eat bread,
\q 
until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. 
\q For dust you are, and to dust you will return."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Adam** - The name Adam is the same as the Hebrew word for "man." Some translations say "Adam" and some say "the man." You may use either form as it refers to the same person.
  * **you have listened to the voice of your wife** - This is an idiom. AT: "you have obeyed what your wife said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **have eaten from the tree** - You can say what it was that they ate. AT: "have eaten the fruit of the tree" or "have eaten some of the fruit of the tree" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **You may not eat from it** - "You must not eat from it" or "Do not eat its fruit"
  * **cursed is the ground** - The word "curse" comes first in the sentence to emphasize that the ground, which had been "good" ([[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:09|1:10]]), was now under God's curse. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I am cursing the ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **in painful toil** - "by doing hard work"
  * **you will eat from it** - The word "it" refers to the ground and is a metonym for the parts of the plants, which grow in the ground, that people eat. AT: "you will eat what grows from it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the plants of the field** - Possible meanings are 1) "the plants that you take care of in your fields" or 2) "the wild plants that grow in the open fields."
  * **By the sweat of your face** - "By doing hard work that makes your face sweat"
  * **you will eat bread** - Here the word "bread" is a synecdoche for food in general. AT: "you will eat food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **until you return to the ground** - "until you die and your body is put in the ground." In some cultures, they put the bodies of people who have died in a hole in the ground. Man's hard work does not end until the time of his death and burial.
  * **For dust you are, and to dust you will return** - "I made you from soil, so your body will become soil again." Translate both occurrences of "dust" with the same word in order to show that man begins and ends in the same condition.
