\v 10 The place where the people were all coming together had a lot of grass. So Jesus said, "Tell the people to sit down." So all of the people sat down, and after the disciples counted the crowd, they found that there were about five thousand people.
\v 11 Then Jesus took the small loaves of bread and the fish, and he thanked God for them. Then he passed the bread and the fish among all who were sitting on the ground. The people ate all the fish and bread they wanted.
\v 12 When everyone had finished eating, he said to the disciples, "Gather up all the pieces of barley bread that the people did not eat. Do not let anything go to waste."

\v 10 Jesus said, "Make the people sit down." (Now there was a lot of grass in the place.) So the men sat down, about five thousand in number.
\v 11 Then Jesus took the loaves and after giving thanks, he gave it to those who were sitting. He did the same with the fish, as much as they wanted.
\v 12 When the people were filled, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the broken pieces which remain, so that nothing will be lost."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **sit down** - "lie down" 
  * **Now there was a lot of grass in the place** - John briefly stops telling about the events in the story in order to give background information about the place where this event happens. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **So the men sat down, about five thousand in number** - While the crowd probably included women and children ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:04|6:4-5]]), here John is counting only the men. 
  * **giving thanks** - Jesus prayed to God the Father and thanked him for the fish and the loaves.
  * **he gave it** - "he" here represents "Jesus and his disciples." AT: "Jesus and his disciples gave it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
