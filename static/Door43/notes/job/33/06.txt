  * **I am just as you are in God's sight** - Here sight represents judgment or evaluation. AT: "I am just as you are in God's judgment" or "God judges you the same way that he judges me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I also have been formed out of the clay** - Though people are not made out of clay, God has made everyone as a potter carefully makes things out of clay. AT: "God has made both of us just as a potter forms things from clay" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
