====== Job 35:12-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 People cry out \add for help\add*,
\q2 but God does not answer them,
\q2 because those who cry out are proud and evil people.
\q1
\v 13 It is useless for them to cry out,
\q2 because God, the Almighty One, does not pay any attention to what they say.
\q1
\v 14 So, when you complain that you cannot see God,
\q2 and you tell him that you are waiting for him \add to decide whether or not you should be punished for what you have done\add*,
\q2 God will not listen to you, either!

\q
\v 12 There they cry out, but God gives no answer
\q because of the pride of evil men.
\q
\v 13 God will certainly not hear a foolish cry;
\q the Almighty will pay no attention to it.
\q
\v 14 How much less will he answer you if you say that you do not see him,
\q that your case is before him, and that you are waiting for him!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Elihu continues speaking.

  * **they cry out** - "the oppressed people cry out"
  * **How much less will he answer you ... that you are waiting for him!** - Since God will not hear the prayers of prideful, evil men, it is even less likely that he will hear Job, who is complaining against him. AT: "So he certainly will not answer you ... that you are waiting for him!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclamations]])
  * **that your case is before him** - "you have presented your case to him"
  * **you are waiting for him** - "you are waiting for him to respond"
