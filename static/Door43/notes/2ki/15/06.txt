\v 6 As for the other matters concerning Azariah, all that he did, are they not written in the book of the events of the kings of Judah?
\v 7 So Azariah slept with his ancestors; they buried him with his ancestors in the city of David. Jotham, his son, became king in his place.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **are they not written ... Judah?** - This question is used to either inform or remind the readers that the information about Azariah is in this other book. This can also be stated in active form. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:08:22|8:23]]. AT: "they are written ... Judah." or "you can read about them ... Judah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Azariah slept with his ancestors** - Sleeping represents dying. AT: "Azariah died as his ancestors had" or "like his ancestors, Azariah died"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **they buried him with his ancestors** - "his family buried him where his ancestors had been buried"
  * **became king in his place** - The phrase "in his place" is a metaphor meaning "instead of him." AT: "became king instead of Azariah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
