\v 30 Therefore you must say to them, 'When you present the best of it, then it must be credited to the Levites as the product from the threshing floor and the winepress.
\v 31 You may eat the rest of your gifts in any place, you and your families, because it is your pay in return for your work in the tent of meeting.
\v 32 You will not incur any guilt by eating and drinking it, if you have presented to Yahweh the best of what you have received. But you must not profane the holy offerings of the people of Israel, or you will die.'"
