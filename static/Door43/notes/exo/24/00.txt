====== Exodus 24 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Moses' covenant ==
The people of Israel promise to obey the covenant Yahweh made with Moses. Their continued blessings were contingent upon their obedience to this covenant. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:promise]] and [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]])

== God's holiness ==
Because Yahweh is perfectly holy, he can only be approach in a certain way. Because of this, only Moses was allowed near Yahweh. This is also why Yahweh is described as a "devouring fire." (See: [[:en:obe:kt:holy]])
