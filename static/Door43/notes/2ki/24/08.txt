===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Nehushta ... Elnathan** - Nehushta is the name of a woman. Elnathan is the name of a man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh** - The nominal adjective "evil" can be translated as a relative clause "things that ... evil." Here Yahweh's "sight" refers to how he judges or decides on the value of something. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:03:01|3:2]]. AT: "He did things that Yahweh said were evil" or "He did the things that Yahweh considers evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he did all that his father had done** - This is a generalization. AT: "he committed the same kinds of sins his father had committed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
