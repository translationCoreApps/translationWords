====== 1 Kings 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter has a description of the palace Solomon built and the materials used in the temple courtyard. It is the last chapter about the building of the temple. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:temple]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Bronze ==
Solomon hired a man from Tyre who was good at casting things out of bronze.The bronze objects were made by hollowing out the shape of the object in clay and then pouring in the hot melted liquid bronze and letting it cool. He made two large pillars and a large water reservoir set on the backs of 12 bronze cows. He made all the instruments for use in the sacrifices outside the temple. He made the furnishing inside the temple out of gold.

== The temple and the palace ==
Solomon spent 13 years building a palace for himself that was much bigger than the temple. It is significant that the house of Solomon was much larger than the house of God. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:houseofgod]])
