\v 20 So the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* said, "We have been building this Temple for forty-six years \add and it is not finished yet\add*! So there is no way you will build it within three days!\f + \ft Or: how will you build it within three days? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"
\v 21 But when Jesus said that about the temple, \add he was really talking about\add* his own body.
\v 22 \add Later\add*, after Jesus had \add died and had\add* become alive again, \add we\add* his disciples remembered the words he had said. As a result, we believed \add what had been prophesied in\add* the Scriptures \add about the Messiah becoming alive again\add*, and we believed that what Jesus said \add was true\add*.

\v 20 "Are you saying that you are you going to rebuild this entire temple is just three days?" they asked him. "It took forty-six years to build this temple."
\v 21 However, the temple Jesus was speaking about was his own body, not the temple building.
\v 22 Later, after Jesus had died and God had raised him from the dead, his disciples remembered what he had said about the temple. They believed both what the scriptures said and what Jesus himself had said.

\v 20 Then the Jewish authorities said, "This temple was built in forty-six years, and you will raise it up in three days?"
\v 21 However, he was speaking about the temple of his body.
\v 22 After he was raised from the dead ones, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the scripture and this statement that Jesus had spoken.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Verses 21 and 22 are not part of the main storyline, rather they comment on the story and tell about something that happens later. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_endofstory]])

  * **forty-six years ... three days** - "46 years ... 3 days" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **you will raise it up in three days?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to show that the Jewish authorities understand that Jesus wants to tear down the temple and build it again in three days. AT: "you cannot possibly rebuild it in three days!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **believed** - Here "believe" means to accept something or trust that it is true.
  * **this statement** - This refers back to Jesus' statement in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:02:17|2:19]].
