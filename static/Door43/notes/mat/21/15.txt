\v 15 The high priests and the men who taught the people the Jewish laws saw the marvelous deeds that Jesus did. They also saw the children shouting in the temple, "We praise the Messiah, the descendant of King David!" They were indignant.
\v 16 They asked him, "How can you tolerate this? Do you hear what these people are shouting?" Then Jesus said to them, "Yes, I hear them, but if you remembered what you have read in the scriptures about children praising me, you would know that God is pleased with them. The psalmist wrote, saying to God, 'You have taught infants and other children to praise you perfectly.'"

\v 17 Then Jesus left the city. The disciples went with him to the village of Bethany, and they stayed there that night.

\v 15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things that he did, and when they heard the children shouting in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they became very angry.
\v 16 They said to him, "Do you hear what these people are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes! But have you never read, 'Out of the mouths of babes and nursing infants you have perfected praise'?"
\v 17 Then Jesus left them and went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verse 16, Jesus quotes from the Psalms to justify how the people had responded to him.

  * **the marvelous things** - "the wonderful things" or "the miracles." This refers to Jesus healing the blind and lame people in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:21:12|21:14]].
  * **Hosanna** - This word means "save us" but can also mean "praise God!" See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:21:09|21:09]].
  * **the Son of David** - Jesus was not David's literal son, so this may be translated as "descendant of king David" (UDB). However, "Son of David" is also a title for the Messiah, and the crowd was probably calling Jesus by this title. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:21:09|21:09]].
  * **they became very angry** - It is implied that they were angry because they did not believe Jesus was the Christ and they did not want other people praising him. AT: "they became very angry because people were praising him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Do you hear what these people are saying?** - The chief priests and scribes ask this question to rebuke Jesus because they are angry with him. AT: "You should not allow people to say these things about you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **But have you never read ... praise'?** - Jesus asks this question to remind the chief priests and scribes of what they have studied in the scriptures. AT: "Yes, I hear them, but you should remember what you read in the scriptures ... praise'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Out of the mouths of babes and nursing infants you have perfected praise** - The phrase "out of the mouths" refers to speaking. AT: "You caused little children and nursing infants to speak perfect praise" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Jesus left them** - "Jesus left the chief priests and scribes"
