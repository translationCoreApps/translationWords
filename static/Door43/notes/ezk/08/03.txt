\v 3 He reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up high above the earth, and in visions God took me \add from Babylon\add* to Jerusalem. He took me \add to the temple\add* to the north gate, to the place where there was an idol that caused Yahweh to be very disgusted and furious.
\v 4 And there in front of me was the brilliant light that indicated the presence of the God whom the Israelite people \add previously worshiped\add*. It was like the vision that I had seen alongside the Kebar River\f + \ft Or: Canal \f*.

\v 3 He reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up high above the earth, and in visions God took me from Babylon to Jerusalem. He took me to the temple, to the inner north gate, to the place where there was an idol that caused Yahweh to be very disgusted and furious.
\v 4 And there in front of me was the very bright light of God himself whom the Israelite people previously worshiped. It was like the vision that I had seen in the plain.

\v 3 Then he reached out the form of a hand and took me by the hair of my head; the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and in visions from God, he brought me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the inner northern gate, where the idol that provokes great jealousy was standing.
\v 4 Then behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision I had seen on the plain.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Ezekiel continues telling about the vision from God.

  * **he reached out** - The word "he" probably refers to the "figure like a man" ([[:en:bible:notes:ezk:08:01|8:2]]).
  * **between earth and heaven** - "between the ground and the sky"
  * **in visions from God, he brought me to Jerusalem** - The words "in visions" mean that this experience is happening in Ezekiel's thoughts. His body would still be in his home while God shows him these things.
  * **the inner northern gate** - "the inner northern gate of the temple." The temple was surrounded by two walls, one inside the other. This gate was on the north side of the inner wall. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the idol that provokes great jealousy** - "the idol that causes God to be very jealous"
  * **according to the vision I had seen on the plain** - Possible meanings are 1) "who looked the same as what I had seen in the vision that I saw when I was on the plain" or 2) "who looked the same as what I saw when I was on the plain."
  * **the plain** - a large area of flat land that has few trees.
