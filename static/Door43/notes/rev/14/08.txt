===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great** - The angel speaks of Babylon being destroyed as if it had fallen.  AT: "Babylon the great has been destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Babylon the great** - "Babylon the large city" or "the important city of Babylon." This was probably a symbol for the city of Rome, which was large, wealthy, and sinful. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **who persuaded** - Babylon is spoken of as if it were a person, instead of a city filled with people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to drink the wine of her immoral passion** - This is a symbol for participating in her sexually immoral passion.  AT: "to be sexually immoral like her" or "to get drunk like her in sexual sin"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **her immoral passion** - Babylon is spoken of as if it were a prostitute who has caused other people to sin along with her. This may well have a double meaning: literal sexual immorality and also the worship of false gods. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
