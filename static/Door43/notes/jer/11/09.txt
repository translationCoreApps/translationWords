<usfm>
\v 9 Then Yahweh said to me, "The people of Jerusalem and the other cities in Judah are rebelling against me.
\v 10 Their ancestors refused to do what I told them to do, and now these people have returned to committing the sins that their ancestors committed. They are worshiping other gods. The people of Israel disobeyed the agreement that I made with their ancestors, and now the people of Judah have done the same thing.

\v 9 Next Yahweh said to me, "A conspiracy has been discovered among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 10 They have turned to the iniquities of their earliest ancestors, who refused to listen to my word, who instead walked after other gods to worship them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah broke my covenant that I established with their ancestors.
