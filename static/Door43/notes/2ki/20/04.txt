===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - "Word" is metonymy for the message Yahweh revealed to Isaiah. This is a common way of speaking, an idiom. AT: "Yahweh spoke his word" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I have heard your prayer, and I have seen your tears** - The second part reinforces the first part to make one message by using parallelism. AT: "I have heard your prayers and seen your tears" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **on the third day** - "two days from now" (UDB) The day Isaiah said this was the first day, so "the third day" would be the same as "two days from now."
