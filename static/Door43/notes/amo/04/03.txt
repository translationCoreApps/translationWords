===== translationWords: =====
 
  * [[:en:obe:other:declare]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **breaks in the city wall** - places where the enemy had broken down the city wall to enter
  * **you will be thrown out toward Harmon** - "they will throw you out toward Harmon" or "your enemies will force you to leave the city and go toward Harmon" (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Harmon** - This is probably a place that we do not know. It might refer to Mount Hermon, but most modern versions simply have "Harmon." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **this is the declaration of Yahweh** - This phrase is used to show that the things God spoke about surely will happen. Translate these words as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:02:11|2:11]].
