<usfm>
\q
\v 23 If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up,
\q if you put unrighteousness far away from your tents.
\q
\v 24 Lay your treasure down in the dust,
\q the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks,
\q
\v 25 and the Almighty will be your treasure,
\q precious silver to you.

  * **you will be built up** - Eliphaz compares Job's restoration to the rebuilding of a house that has fallen. This can be stated in active form. AT: "he will heal you and make you prosper again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **if you put unrighteousness far away from your tents** - Here unrighteousness is pictured as a person who is living in Job's tent who must be removed. AT: "if you and everyone in your house stops sinning" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Lay your treasure down in the dust** - To lay a treasure in the dust is to treat it as unimportant. AT: "Consider your riches to be as unimportant as dust" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
