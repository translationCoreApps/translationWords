\v 18 Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he was hungry.
\v 19 Seeing a fig tree along the roadside, he went to it and found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it, "May there be no fruit from you ever again," and immediately the fig tree withered.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus uses a fig tree to teach his disciples about faith and prayer.

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Matthew explains that Jesus is hungry and that is why he stops at the fig tree.
  * **withered** - "died"
