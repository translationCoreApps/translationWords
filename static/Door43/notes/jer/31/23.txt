\v 23 Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, says this, "When I bring back the people to their land, they will say this in the land of Judah and its cities, 'May Yahweh bless you, you righteous place where he lives, you holy mountain.'
\v 24 For Judah and all his cities will live together there, as will farmers and shepherds with their flocks.
\v 25 For I will give the weary ones water to drink, and I will fill everyone suffering from thirst."
\v 26 After this I awoke, and I realized that my sleep had been refreshing.
