===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The horde of your invaders will be like small dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones as chaff that passes away.** - This emphasizes how weak and insignificant the invading army is before God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **horde of your invaders** - "the many soldiers of the army that is attacking you"
  * **the ruthless ones as chaff** - The translator can supply the verb "will be". AT: "the soldiers who show you no mercy will be as chaff" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **You will be punished by Yahweh of hosts** - This can be stated in active form. The word "you" refers to the people of Jerusalem. Possible meanings are 1) "Yahweh of hosts will punish you" or 2) "Yahweh of hosts will help you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
