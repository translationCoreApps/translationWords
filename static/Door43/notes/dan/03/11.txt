===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Whoever does not fall down and worship must be thrown into a blazing furnace** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Soldiers must throw into a blazing furnace anyone who does not lie down on the ground and worship" (See: [[(en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **fall down** - Here "fall down" means "quickly lie down"
  * **blazing furnace** - This is a large room filled with a hot fire. Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:03:06|3:6]].
  * **affairs** - "matters" or "business" 
  * **Shadrach ... Meshach ... Abednego** - These are the Babylonian names of the three Jewish friends of Daniel. See how you translated these names in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:01:06|1:7]].
  * **pay no attention to you** - "do not pay attention to you"
  * **prostrate themselves** - "stretch themselves out on the ground face down in worship" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **the golden statue you have set up** - That Nebuchadnezzar's men have set up the statue is spoken of as if Nebuchadnezzar has set it up. AT: "the golden statue your men have set up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
