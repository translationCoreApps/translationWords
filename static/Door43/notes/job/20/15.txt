===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Zophar continues speaking to Job.

  * **He swallows down riches ... cast them out of his stomach** - Zophar speaks of gaining and losing wealth as if it were food that a person eats and vomits. AT: "The wicked person becomes very wealthy, but he loses his wealth like a person who vomits up his food. God causes him to lose it all" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He swallows down riches** - Possible meanings are that "swallows down riches" represents 1) accumulating riches and storing them selfishly. AT: "The wicked man gains much wealth and keeps it all for himself" or 2) accumulating riches in wicked ways. AT: "The wicked man steals much wealth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **God will cast them out of his stomach** - Here "cast them out of his stomach" is a metonym for causing the man to vomit them. This is a metaphor for causing the man to lose his riches. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **cast** - "throw"
  * **He will suck the poison of asps** - Here "suck the poison of asps" represents doing evil things. Both are very dangerous.

  * **asps** - poisonous snakes
  * **the viper's tongue will kill him** - The viper is a poisonous snake. Its tongue represents its poisonous bite. AT: "the viper's poisonous bite will kill him" or "the viper will bite him and he will die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the viper's tongue will kill him** - The viper represents the man's wickedness. AT: "his wickedness will kill him like a viper's bite" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
