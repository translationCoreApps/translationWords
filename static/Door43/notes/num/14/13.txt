\v 13 Moses said to Yahweh, "If you do this, then the Egyptians will hear about it, because you rescued this people from them by your power.
\v 14 They will tell it to this land's inhabitants. They have heard that you, Yahweh, are present with this people, because you are seen face to face. Your cloud stands over our people. You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.
