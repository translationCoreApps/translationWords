\v 3 On the day that Yahweh gives you rest from your suffering and anguish, and from the hard labor which you were required to perform, 
\v 4 you will sing this taunt song against the king of Babylon, 
\q1 "How the oppressor has come to an end, the proud fury ended!
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa the proud fury ended \fqb , some versions have \fqa the golden city ended \fqb , \fqa the turmoil ended \fqb , \fqa the hostility ended \fqb , or \fqa the arrogance ended \fqb . \f*
