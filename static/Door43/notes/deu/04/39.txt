  * **lay it on your heart** - This is an idiom. AT: "remember it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **in heaven above and on the earth beneath** - The two phrases "in heaven" and "on the earth" show two extremes and mean "everywhere". AT: "over everything" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **prolong your days** - Long days are a metaphor for a long life. AT: "be able to live a long time" Translate these words as they are in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:04:25|4:26]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
