===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh speaks about enemy soldiers as the lovers of Jerusalem.

  * **I will calm my fury against you; my anger will leave you** - The words "fury" and "anger" refer to the punishment that Yahweh inflicts because he is angry. The two phrases mean basically the same thing. AT: "I will stop punishing you because I will no longer be angry with you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
