===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Some of the scribes answered** - "Some of the scribes said to Jesus." There were scribes present when the Sadducees were questioning Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **For they** - It is unclear if this refers to the scribes, or the Sadducees, or both. It is best to keep the statement general.
  * **they did not dare ask him any more questions** - "they were afraid to ask ... questions" or "they did not risk asking ... questions." They understood that they did not know as much as Jesus did, but they did not want to say that. This can be made explicit. AT: "they did ask him any more tricky questions because they feared that his wise answers would make them appear foolish again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
