===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to refer to the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **So the sound of a noisy crowd was around her** - The sound of the crowd is used to refer to the crowd of people. AT: "So there was a noisy crowd around her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **was around her ... on their hands** - "was around her ... on her and her sister's hands." This verse begins by referring to one of the sisters here but the situation is probably the same for both sisters. If one sister must be specified in your language, refer to Oholibah here. In the second part of the verse it switches back to referring to both sisters with the word "their." 
  * **Sabeans were brought** - This can be stated in active form. The word "Sabeans" refers to people from Sheba. AT: "Sabeans had come" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **they put bracelets** - The word "they" refers to the men.
