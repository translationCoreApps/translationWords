\v 18 And so God put the first covenant into effect only by means of animals' blood that flowed when the priests sacrificed them.
\v 19 After Moses had declared to all the Israelites everything that God commanded in the laws that God gave him, he took calves' and goats' blood mixed with water. He dipped into this blood scarlet wool that he tied around a sprig of hyssop. Then he sprinkled with some of the blood the scroll itself containing God's laws. Then he sprinkled more of that blood on all the people.
\v 20 He said to them, "This is the blood that brings into effect the covenant that God commanded that you obey."

\v 18 So not even the first covenant was established without blood.
\v 19 For when Moses had given every command in the law to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water, red wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people.
\v 20 Then he said, "This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you."

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **So not even the first covenant was established without blood** - This can be stated in active and positive form. AT: "So God established even the first covenant with blood" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **first covenant** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:08:06|8:7]].
  * **blood** - The death of animals sacrificed to God is spoken of as if it were nothing but blood.  AT: "the death of animals sacrificed to God" (See: [[:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **took the blood ... with water ... and sprinkled ... the scroll ... and all the people** - The priest dipped the hyssop in the blood and the water and then shook the hyssop so drops of blood and water would fall on the scroll and on the people. Sprinkling was a symbolic action done by the priests by which they applied the benefits of the covenant to people and to objects. Here the scroll and the people's acceptability to God are renewed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **hyssop** - a woody shrub with flowers in summer, used in ceremonial sprinkling
  * **the blood of the covenant** - Here "blood" refers to the death of the animals sacrificed to carry out the covenant's requirements. AT: "the blood that brings into effect the covenant" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
