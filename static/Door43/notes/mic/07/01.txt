\q
\v 1 Woe is me!
\q For me it is like when the harvest of summer fruit is over,
\q and also even the gleaning of the leftover grapes in the vineyards:
\q There are no more clusters of fruit to be found,
\q none of the early figs that I crave.
\q
\v 2 Faithful people have disappeared from the land,
\q there is no upright person in all mankind.
\q They all lie in wait to shed blood;
\q each one hunts his own brother with a net.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For me it is like when the harvest of summer fruit ... the early figs** - Micah emphasizes that there are no longer any honest people, loyal to God, in Israel. AT: "For me the people of Israel are like a vineyard after the harvest and gleaning. The vines are bare. I can no longer find any fruit, but I still crave to eat a ripe fig. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Faithful people have disappeared ... with a net** - Micah exaggerates to show how bad the situation is. He feels there is no one good left in Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
