====== Genesis 16 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 16:11-14, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Plural marriage ==
Abram married Hagar while he was also married to Sarai. Even though Abram had his wife's permission, this was an immoral and sinful action. It also showed a lack of faith in God. Sarai quickly became jealous of Hagar. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]], [[:en:obe:kt:faith]], [[:en:obe:kt:jealous]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
