  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
  * **General Information:** - Yahweh uses two questions to emphasize to Job that he rules the rain clouds and lightning and Job does not. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

  * **Can you raise ... 'Here we are'?** - These can be translated as statements. AT: "Tell me if you can raise your voice up to the clouds, so that an abundance of rainwater may cover you. Tell me if you can send out bolts of lightning that they may go out, that they say to you, 'Here we are!'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **an abundance of rainwater** - The abstract noun "abundance" can be translated as the adjective "abundant." AT: "an abundant amount of rainwater" or "a flood of waters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Here we are** - This pictures the lightning bolts as servants saying they are ready to follow commands. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
