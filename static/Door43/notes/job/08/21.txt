===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, your lips with shouting** - These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize how happy Job would be if he were innocent. The word "he" refers to God and "your" refers to Job. AT: "God will make you very happy again if you are innocent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **fill your mouth with laughter** - God causing Job to laugh is spoken of as if God had poured laughter into Job's mouth. AT: "cause you to continually laugh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your lips with shouting** - The verb "fill" is understood from the previous clause. God causing him to shout for joy is spoken of as if God had poured joy into Job's mouth. AT: "God will cause you to shout for joy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Those who hate you will be clothed with shame** - Here "shame" is spoken of as if it were clothing that God will cause Job's enemies to wear. This means they will be very ashamed. AT: "God will cause those who hate you to be very ashamed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the tent of the wicked will be no more** - Here "tent" refers to the homes of the wicked. AT: "the houses of the wicked will be destroyed"
