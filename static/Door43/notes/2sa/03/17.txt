\v 17 Abner spoke with the elders of Israel saying, "In the past you were trying to have David be king over you.
\v 18 Now do it. For Yahweh has spoken of David saying, 'By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.'"
