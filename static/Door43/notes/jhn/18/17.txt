===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Are you not also one of the disciples of this man?** - This appears in the form of a question to enable the servant to express her remark somewhat cautiously. AT: "You are also one of the arrested man's disciples! Are you not?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **Now the servants and the officers were standing there, and they had made a charcoal fire, for it was cold, and they were warming themselves** - These were the high priest's servants and the temple guards. AT: "It was cold, so the high priest's servants and temple guards made a charcoal fire and were standing and warming themselves around it" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline so John can add the information about the people who were warming themselves around the fire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
