===== translationNotes: =====

  * **My sheep hear my voice** - The word "sheep" is a metaphor for the followers of Jesus. The metaphor of Jesus as the "shepherd" is also implied. AT: "Just as sheep obey the voice of their true shepherd, my followers heed my voice" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **no one will snatch them out of my hand** - Here the word "hand" is a metonym that represents the protective care of Jesus. AT: "no one will steal them away from me" (UDB) or "they will remain secure forever in my care" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
