===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - The word "now" does not mean "at this moment," but it is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.
  * **They said to him** - Matthew does not make clear who answered Jesus. If you need to specify an audience you can translate as "The people said to Jesus."
