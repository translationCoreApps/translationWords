\v 10 But when you go over the Jordan and live in the land that Yahweh your God is causing you to inherit, and when he gives you rest from all your enemies round about, so that you live in safety,
\v 11 then it will happen that to the place where Yahweh your God will choose to cause his name to live, there will you bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, and the offerings presented by your hand, and all your choice offerings for vows that you will vow to Yahweh.
