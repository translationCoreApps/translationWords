\v 25 Similarly, after they ate their meal, he took a cup \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add of wine\add*. He \add thanked God for it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the cup** - It is best to translate this literally. The Corinthians knew which cup he took, so it is not simply "a cup" or "some cup" or "any cup." Possible meanings are that it was 1) the cup of wine that one would expect him to use or 2) the third or fourth of the four cups of wine that the Jews drank at the Passover meal.
  * **Do this as often as you drink it** - "Drink from this cup, and as often as you drink from it"
  * **proclaim the Lord's death** - teach about the crucifixion and resurrection
  * **until he comes** - Where Jesus comes to can be made explicit. AT: "until Jesus comes back to the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
