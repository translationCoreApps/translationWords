===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul reminds them that it is the gospel that saves them and he tells them again what the gospel is. Then he gives them a short history lesson, which ends with what will yet happen.

  * **remind you** - "help you remember"
  * **on which you stand** - Paul is speaking of the Corinthians as if they were a house and the gospel as if it were the foundation on which the house was standing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you are being saved** - This can be stated in active form. "God will save you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
