  * **General Information:** - These are Yahweh's words about Egypt.

  * **Then a sword will come against Egypt** - The word "sword" here represents war or an army that attacks. AT: "There will be war against Egypt" or "An enemy army will attack Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **there will be anguish in Cush** - The abstract noun "anguish" can be expressed in terms of how the people feel. AT: "the people of Cush will be very sad" or "the people of Cush will suffer"
  * **when the killed people fall in Egypt** - Possible meanings are that 1) "fall" is a metonym for dying. AT: "when people in Egypt are killed" or 2) "fall" refers to their bodies falling and lying on the ground. AT: "when people in Egypt are killed and lie fallen" 
  * **when they take her wealth** - "when the attackers take away the wealth of Egypt"
  * **when her foundations are ruined** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "when the attackers destroy the foundations of the buildings in Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])\
