\v 35 In this way, by following all that I have commanded you to do, you must treat Aaron and his sons. For seven days you must prepare them.
\v 36 Every day you must offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement. You must purify the altar by making atonement for it, and you must anoint it in order to set it apart to me.
