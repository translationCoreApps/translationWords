\v 30 Keep this in mind: You have observed the things that I have done and said, but all of those events \add that I have just told you about\add* will happen before all of you will die.
\v 31 You can \add be certain that\add* these things \add that I have prophesied\add* will happen. \add You can be more certain of that than\add* you can \add be certain that\add* the earth and what is in the sky will stay in place.
\v 32 But no one knows the exact time \add when I will return\add*. The angels in heaven also do not know. Even \add I, God's\add* son, do not know. Only my Father knows.

\v 30 Keep this in mind: this generation will not die until these things take place.
\v 31 You can be certain that these things that I have prophesied will happen. The earth and what is in the sky will one day be destroyed, but these things that I have told you will certainly happen.
\v 32 But no one knows the exact time when I will return. The angels in heaven also do not know. Even I, God's Son, do not know. Only my Father knows.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all of these things occur.
\v 31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
\v 32 But concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Truly, I say to you** - This indicates that the statement that follows is especially true and important. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:03:28|3:28]].
  * **will not pass away** - This is a polite way to talk about someone dying. AT: "will not die" or "will not end" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **until all of these things** - The phrase "these things" refers to the days of tribulation. 
  * **Heaven and earth** - The two extremes are given to refer to all of the sky, including the sun, moon, stars, and planets, and all of the earth. AT: "The sky, the earth, and everything in them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **will pass away** - "will cease to exist." Here this phrase refers to the world ending. 
  * **my words will never pass away** - Jesus speaks of words not losing their power as if they were something that will never physically die. AT: "my words will never lose their power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **that day or that hour** - This refers to the time that the Son of Man will return. AT: "that day or that hour that the Son of Man will return" or "the day or the hour that I will return" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son** - These are listed among those who do not know when the Son of Man will return. AT: "not even the angels in heaven or the Son know" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the angels in heaven** - Here "heaven" refers to the place where God lives.
  * **but the Father** - It is best to translate "Father" with the same word that your language naturally uses to refer to a human father. Also, this is an ellipsis, stating that the Father knows when the Son will return. AT: "but only the Father knows" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
