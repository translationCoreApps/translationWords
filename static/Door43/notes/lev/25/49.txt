\v 49 It might be the person's uncle, or his uncle's son, who redeems him, or anyone who is his close relative from his family. Or, if he has become prosperous, he may redeem himself.
\v 50 He must bargain with the man who bought him; they must count the years from the year he sold himself to his purchaser until the year of Jubilee. The price of his redemption must be figured in keeping with the rate paid to a hired servant, for the number of years he might continue to work for the one who bought him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **until the year of Jubilee** - An Israelite could be a slave only until the year of Jubilee. These instructions are for when an Israelite wanted to buy back his freedom before the year of Jubilee.
  * **the year of Jubilee** - "the year of restoration" or "the year to return land and to free slaves"
  * **The price of his redemption must be figured** - The verb "figured" can be stated in active form. AT: "They must figure the price of his redemption"  or "They must figure how much to pay for the foreigner to set the Israelite free"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **in keeping with the rate paid to a hired servant** - The verbs "paid" and "hired" can be expressed in active form. AT: "according to the rate a person would pay to hire a servant." If the Israelite bought back his freedom, the foreigner would have to hire a servant to do the work that the Israelite would have done but will not. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **for the number of years he might continue to work** - "for the number of years until the jubilee that the Israelite would have continued to work but will not"
