===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues speaking at the Pharisee's house, but addresses his host directly.

  * **the man who had invited him** - "the Pharisee who had invited him to his house for a meal"
  * **When you give** - "you" is singular because Jesus is speaking directly to the Pharisee that invited him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **do not invite** - This probably does not mean they can never invite these people. More likely it means they should invite others as well. AT: "do not only invite" or "do not always invite"
  * **as they may** - "because they might"
  * **you will be repaid** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "in this way they will repay you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
