\v 16 So confess your sins to one another, and pray for each other, so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is very strong in its working.
\v 17 Elijah was a man just like us. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain in the land for three years and six months.
\v 18 Then Elijah prayed again. The heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.
