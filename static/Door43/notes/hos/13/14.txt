===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking.

  * **Will I rescue them from the hand of Sheol? Will I rescue them from death?** - Yahweh uses these questions to tell the people of Israel that he is not going to save them from dying. He will certainly punish them. AT: "I will certainly not rescue them from death and from going down to Sheol." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Where, death, are your plagues? Where, Sheol, is your destruction?** - Yahweh speaks to "death" and "Sheol" as if they were people. Yahweh uses questions to say that he will destroy the people soon. AT: "Now I will cause plagues and let the people of Israel die. I will destroy them and send them to Sheol." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Compassion is hidden** - The possibility of having compassion is spoken of as if it were an object. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Compassion is hidden from my eyes** - Not to think about having compassion is spoken of as if compassion were hidden so that it cannot be seen. AT: "I have no compassion for them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
