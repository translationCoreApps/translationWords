===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I eat ashes like bread** - David would have sat in ashes as an act of mourning, therefore ashes would have fallen on his food. AT: "I eat ashes like I eat bread" or "As I mourn, ashes fall on the bread that I eat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **and mix my drink with tears** - David did not purposefully mix his drink with tears; rather his tear would have fallen into his cup while he mourned and wept. AT: "and my tears fall into the cup that I drink" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **you have lifted me up to throw me down** - God has not literally lifted and thrown David's body to the ground; rather David says this to describe what he is feeling and experiencing. AT: "it is like you have lifted me up to throw me down" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
