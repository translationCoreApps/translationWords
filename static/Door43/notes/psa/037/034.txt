===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he will raise you up to possess the land** - Here "raise you up" refers to God giving honor to those who wait for him. AT: "he will honor you by giving you the land" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the wicked** - This refers to wicked people. AT: "the wicked people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **are cut off** - The destruction of the wicked is spoken of as if they were a branch of a plant that was cut off and thrown away. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:037:008|37:9]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
