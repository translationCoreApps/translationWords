===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The oppressed will eat and be satisfied** - This refers to the fellowship meal after the writer offers his sacrifices that he promised to offer to God. He will invite those who were suffering to eat a part of the animal he sacrificed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **those who seek Yahweh** - Those who want to know Yahweh and please him are spoken of as if they are literally seeking to find Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **May your hearts live forever** - Here "hearts" represent the whole person. AT: "May you live forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **May your hearts** - Here "your" is plural and refers to the oppressed people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **will remember and turn to Yahweh** - Starting to obey Yahweh is spoken of as if the people physically turn toward Yahweh. AT: "will remember Yahweh and obey him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **all the families of the nations will bow down before you** - This means the same thing as the first part of the sentence. The writer is emphasizing that everyone from every place will worship and obey Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **will bow down before you** - This is a sign of giving honor and respect to someone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **before you** - Here "you" refers to Yahweh. It can be translated in the third person to match the first part of the sentence. AT: "before him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
