====== Leviticus 22:7-9 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 After the sun sets, he may touch anything that he wants to, and he will also be permitted to eat some of the sacred offerings that are for him to eat.
\v 8 He must not eat anything that is found dead or that has been killed by wild animals, because if he did that, he would not be unacceptable to me. I, Yahweh \add am commanding those things\add*.
\p
\v 9 The priests must obey my commandments in order that they will not become guilty and die as a result of despising\f + \ft Or: not obeying \f* them.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 After the sun sets, he may eat food from the sacred offerings, because they are now his food that is to be eaten.
\v 8 But he must not eat anything that has died a natural death or that has been killed by wild animals, because if he did that, he would be unfit to work for me. I, Yahweh, am commanding those things.
\p
\v 9 The priests must obey my commandments; they must not despise them, or they will become guilty and die. I am Yahweh, the one who sets them apart for my honor.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 7 When the sun has set, he will then be clean. After sunset he may eat from the holy things, because they are his food.
\v 8 He must not eat anything found dead or killed by wild animals, by which he would defile himself. I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 9 The priests must follow my instructions, or they will be guilty of sin and could die for profaning me. I am Yahweh who makes them holy.
