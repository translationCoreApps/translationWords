===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Repent, therefore** - "So repent" 
  * **If you do not, I** - "If you do not repent, I" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **wage war against them** - "fight against them"
  * **with the sword in my mouth** - This refers to the sword in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:01:14|1:16]]. Although symbols in apocalyptic language are normally not to be translated, translators may choose whether or not to explain this symbol as a symbol of God's word, as the UDB does. This symbol indicates that Christ will defeat his enemies by giving a simple command. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **Let the one who has an ear listen** - Being willing to listen is spoken of as having an ear. AT: "Let the one who is willing to listen, listen" or "If you are willing, listen." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:02:06|2:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **To the one who conquers** - This refers anyone who conquers. AT: "anyone who resists evil" or "those who do not agree to do evil." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:02:06|2:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
