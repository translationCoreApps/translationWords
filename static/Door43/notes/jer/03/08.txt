====== Jeremiah 03:8-10 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 The people of Judah saw what I did to them. But they are just like the people of Israel. They are not afraid \add of what I will do to them\add*. They also \add have turned away from me and are worshiping idols like\add* women who abandon their husbands and go to other men \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 9 They thought that worshiping idols did not matter to me, so they have made the entire land unacceptable to me by worshiping idols of wood and stone.
\v 10 The people of Judah have pretended to return to me, but they have not really done that. \add This is true because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it."

\v 8 So I sent the people of Israel away to other countries, as a man writes a note saying that he is divorcing his wife and then sends her away because she has committed adultery. But I realized that, just as the people of Israel, the people of Judah were not at all afraid of me. Instead, they acted just as the people of Israel had done. They also turned away from me and began worshiping idols, just as women who leave their husbands and go to other men.
\v 9 They did not care that worshiping idols offended me, so they have made the entire land unacceptable to me by worshiping idols of wood and stone.
\v 10 The people of Judah have pretended to return to me, but they have not been sincere. This is true because I, Yahweh, have said it."

<usfm>
\v 8 So I saw that, in the same way that faithless Israel had committed adultery and I had sent her away and had given a bill of divorce against her, her faithless sister Judah did not fear; she also went out and acted like a prostitute.
\v 9 Her prostitution was nothing to her; she defiled the land, and she committed adultery with stones and trees.
\v 10 Then after all of this, her faithless sister Judah returned to me, not with all her heart, but with a lieâ€”this is Yahweh's declaration."
