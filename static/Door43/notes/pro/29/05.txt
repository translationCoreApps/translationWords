  * **spreading a net for his feet** - The writer compares the flattery of a person to setting that person up to being caught in a trap. AT: "setting a trap to catch that person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **In the sin of an evil person is a trap** - When an evil person sins, it is as if he is stepping into a trap. He desires to do evil to other people, but God will use what he does to punish him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
