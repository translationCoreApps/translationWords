===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he lay facedown** - This indicates that Moses was humbling himself before God. He was afraid that God would punish the people for rebelling against God and his chosen leaders. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **who is set apart to him** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "whom Yahweh has set apart for himself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
