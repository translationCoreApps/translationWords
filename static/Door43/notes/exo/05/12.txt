\v 12 So the people scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
\v 13 The taskmasters kept urging them and saying, "Finish your work, just as when straw was given to you."
\v 14 Pharaoh's taskmasters beat the Israelite foremen, those same men whom they had put in charge of the workers. The taskmasters kept asking them, "Why have you not produced all the bricks required of you, either yesterday and today, as you used to do in the past?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **all the land of Egypt** - This is an exaggeration used to show the extra effort Israel made to meet Pharaoh's demands. AT: "a wide area" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **taskmasters** - "slave drivers" These were Egyptians whose job was to force the Israelites to do hard work. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:01:11|1:11]].
  * **stubble** - the part of a plant that is left over after harvest
  * **Why have you not produced all the bricks required of you ... in the past?** - The taskmasters used this question to show they were angry with the lack of bricks. AT: "You are not producing enough bricks, either yesterday or today, as you did in the past!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
