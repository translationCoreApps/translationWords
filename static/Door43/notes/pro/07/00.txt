====== Proverbs 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Chapter 7 continues a collection of proverbs that ends in chapter nine. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Parallelism ==

Proverbs are often written without any surrounding context and in two lines of text. Each line will have a certain relationship to the other line. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Many of the proverbs are stated as promises or commands, but they are intended to be advice. 

== My Son ==

Occasionally the author addresses a proverb to "my son". This is not intended to restrict the words of that proverb to only males, but is still given in the context of a father warning his son. 

== Adulteress ==

This chapter continues the theme about the adulteress and warns the young man to avoid her.
