\q
\v 9 So I will still accuse you—this is Yahweh's declaration—and I will accuse your sons' sons.
\q
\v 10 For cross over to the coasts of Kittim and look. Send messengers out to Kedar and find out 
\q and see if there has ever before been anything like this.
\q
\v 11 Has a nation exchanged gods, even though they were not gods?
\q But my people have exchanged their glory for what cannot help them.
