===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "you" here is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **fringes** - "tassels" (UDB). These are threads that are bound together and hang from the end of each corner of the cloak. 
  * **the cloak** - a long garment that a person wears over his other clothes
