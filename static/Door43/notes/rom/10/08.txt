\v 8 But instead, those who believe in Christ can say what Moses wrote: "You can find out about God's message very easily. You can speak about it and think about it." This is the message that we proclaim: that people must believe in Christ.
\v 9 This message is that if anyone of you confirms that Jesus is Lord, and if you truly believe that God raised him from the dead, he will save you.
\v 10 If people believe these things, God will put them right with himself. And for those who state publicly that Jesus is Lordâ€”God will save them.

\v 8 But what does it say? 
\q "The word is near you, 
\q in your mouth and in your heart."
\p
That is the word of faith, which we proclaim.
\v 9 For if with your mouth you acknowledge Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead ones, you will be saved.
\v 10 For with the heart man believes for righteousness, and with the mouth he acknowledges for salvation.

  * **The word is near you** - Paul speaks of God's "message" as if it were a person who can move. AT: "The message is right here" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **in your mouth** - The word "mouth" is a synecdoche that refers to what a person says. AT: "it is in what you say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
