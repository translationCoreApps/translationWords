<usfm>
\v 30 So I searched for a man from them who would build up a wall and who would stand before me in its breach for the land so I would not destroy it, but I found no one.
\v 31 So I will pour out my indignation upon them. I will finish them with the fire of my indignation and set their way on their own headsâ€”this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh compares the leaders of Jerusalem to a wall and himself to an invading army. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **a man from them who would build up a wall** - This speaks of a man who would take responsibility to pray for the people and to lead them to repentance as if that man were to build a wall to protect the people from Yahweh. AT: "a man from among them who would act like he built a wall" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **stand before me in its breach** - Its "breach" refers to a gap in the wall. This speaks of the man defending the people before Yahweh as if he were a warrior standing in the breach to defend the city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for the land so I would not destroy it** - Here the "land" represents the people who live there. AT: "for the people so that I would not destroy them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **pour out my indignation upon them** - This speaks of Yahweh punishing the people as if his indignation were a liquid that he poured out on them. AT: "I will punish the people because of my indignation for them" or "I will punish the people because of my anger against them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **indignation** - "wrath." This refers to strong displease or anger against something that is wicked. 
  * **I will finish them with the fire of my indignation** - This speaks of how harsh Yahweh's judgement is by comparing it to a fire. Here destroying the people is referred to as "finishing" them. AT: "I will destroy them with my wrath which is as intense as a blazing fire" or "I will destroy them with my wrath" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **set their way on their own heads** - Setting something on a person's head refers to making them carry a burden or take responsibility for it. AT: "make them take responsibility for what they have done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
