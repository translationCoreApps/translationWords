===== translationNotes: =====

  * **His archers surround me all around** - Job speaks of himself being the focus of God's attacks as if God has set him up as a target and God had arches surrounding him to attach him. AT: "It is as though his archers have me surrounded" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **God pierces my kidneys and does not spare me; he pours out my bile on the ground** - Job speaks of the pain he is feeling by comparing it to God piercing his body with arrow. Here "God" represents the arrows that he shoots. AT: "It feels like God's arrows have pierced my kidneys and my liver, spilling my bile on the ground. He does not spare me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **smashes through my wall** - Job speaks of the pain that he feels by comparing himself to a wall that God smashes through. AT: "I feel like a wall that God smashes through" or "I feel like a wall that God breaks through" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he runs upon me like a warrior** - Job describes God as a soldier that attacks him. AT: "it is like he is a warrior who runs at me to attack me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
