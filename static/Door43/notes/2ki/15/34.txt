===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 34 Jotham did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh. He followed the example of all his father Azariah had done.
\v 35 However, the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense at the high places. Jotham built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh.
\v 36 As for the other matters concerning Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the events of the kings of Judah?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **what was right in the eyes of Yahweh** - The phrase "eyes of Yahweh" is a metonym for Yahweh's sight, which is a metaphor for Yahweh's judgment. AT: "what was right in Yahweh's judgment" or "what Yahweh considers to be right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the high places were not taken away** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one took away the high places" or "Jotham did not have anyone take the high places away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **were not taken away** - Being taken away represents being destroyed. AT: "were not destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Jotham built the upper gate** - "Jotham built" represents Jotham making his workers build it. AT: "Jotham had his workers build the upper gate" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **are they not written ... Judah?** - This question is used to either inform or remind the readers that the information about Jotham is in this other book. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:08:22|8:23]]. AT: "they are written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
