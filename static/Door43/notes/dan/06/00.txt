====== Daniel 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 6:25-28, which is the poetic part of the quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== Daniel and the lions ==

Daniel was thrown into the lion's den for praying to Yahweh. But Yahweh protected him and the lions did not hurt him at all.
