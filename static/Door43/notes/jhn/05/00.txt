====== John 05 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Porticos ==
Many of the Jews believed these porticos had healing properties. This happened when the waters were "stirred up." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== "The resurrection of judgment" ==
This is a reference to a time after death when all of mankind will be judged. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:death]] and [[:en:obe:kt:judge]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Son, Son of God ==

Jesus refers to himself as "the Son," the "Son of Man" and the "Son of God." Some languages may struggle having a person refer to himself in the third person. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sonofman]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sonofgod]])

== "He has testified concerning me" ==
Jesus speaks about the Old Testament testifying concerning himself. The Old Testament gives many prophecies concerning the Messiah which described Jesus before he came to earth. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:christ]])
