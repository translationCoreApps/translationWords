===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Put off your old man** - Paul is speaking of moral qualities as if they were pieces of clothing. AT: "You must change ... your behavior" or "You must put away ... the old man." See how you translated "old man" in [[:en:bible:notes:eph:04:20|4:22]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you may be renewed in the spirit of your mind** - This maybe changed to active tense. AT: "God may help you grow closer to him and think in new ways" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **so that you may put on the new man** - A person who believes in Christ becomes a new person who lives differently just as a person looks totally different when he puts on new clothes, having "put off" the old way of living ([[:en:bible:notes:eph:04:20|4:22]]) and "put on the new." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **which is according to God** - "which reflects the nature of God" or "which shows what God is like"
