===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Do not fear or be afraid** - Yahweh uses two similar expressions in order to strengthen his encouragement. AT: "Do not be afraid" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Have I not declared to you long ago, and announced it?** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he is the one who predicted the events that have now happened. This can be translated as a statement. The word "announced" means basically the same thing as "declared." AT: "I declared these things to you long ago." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Is there any God besides me?** - Yahweh uses a question again to emphasize that there is no other God. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "There is no God besides me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **There is no other Rock** - Yahweh speaks of himself as if he were a large rock under which people can find shelter. This means he has the power to protect his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
