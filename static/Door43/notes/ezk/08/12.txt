\v 12 God said to me, "Son of man, look at what the Israelite elders are doing here in the darkness, each of them standing in his rooms with the carved images, worshiping his own idols! They are saying, 'Yahweh does not see us; Yahweh has deserted this country.'"
\v 13 He also said, "But you will see things that are even more detestable!"

\v 12 Then he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark? Each one does this in the hidden chamber of his idol, for they say, 'Yahweh does not see us! Yahweh has forsaken the land.'"
\v 13 And he said to me, "Turn again and see the other great abominations that they are doing."
