\q1 "\add I will punish the people of\add* Tyre \add city\add* because of the many sins that their people have committed;
\q2 I will not change my mind about punishing them
\q1 because they also captured large groups of our people and took them to Edom,
\q2 disregarding the treaty of friendship that they had made \add with your rulers\add*.
\q1
\v 10 So I will cause a fire to completely burn the walls of Tyre
\q2 and also destroy its fortresses."

\v 9 This is what Yahweh says:
\q "For three sins of Tyre,
\q even for four,
\q I will not turn away punishment,
\q because they had delivered up a whole people to Edom,
\q and they broke their covenant of brotherhood.
\q
\v 10 I will send fire on the walls of Tyre,
\q and it will devour her fortresses."
