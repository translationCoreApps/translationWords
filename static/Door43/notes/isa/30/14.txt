===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah describes how Yahweh will destroy the people of Judah. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:30:12|30:12-13]])

  * **He will break it** - Here "it" refers to the part in the wall that is about to fall. The part in the wall is a metaphor that represents the people of Judah and their sin mentioned in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:30:12|30:12-13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **as a potter's vessel is broken** - This simile means that the piece of wall will break as quickly and completely as a clay jar that falls to the ground. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **potter** - A potter is a person who makes pots and jars out of clay.
  * **there will not be found** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one will be able to find" or "there will not be" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a shard with which to scrape** - "a shard big enough to scrape"
  * **fire from the hearth** - The word "fire" here refers here to ashes. AT: "ashes from the fireplace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
