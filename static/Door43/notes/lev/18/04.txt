===== translationNotes: =====

  * **My laws are what you must do, and my commandments are what you must keep** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the people must obey everything that Yahweh has commanded them to do. You can translate this parallelism into one statement that conveys the requirement to keep all of Yahweh's commands. AT: "You must obey all of my laws and commandments" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **so that you walk in them** - Obeying Yahweh's commandments is spoken of as if the commandments were a path on which the person walks. AT: "so that you conduct your behavior according to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
