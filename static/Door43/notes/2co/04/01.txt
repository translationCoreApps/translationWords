====== 2 Corinthians 04:1-2 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 So, because God has acted so kindly \add toward me\add* enabling \add me to teach\add* this great \add message to people\add*, I never get \add so\add* discouraged \add that I stop teaching it\add*.
\v 2 And I have determined that we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* will be honest \f + \ft litotes \f* in everything that we do. We will not \add do anything that would cause\add* us to be ashamed \add if people found out about it\add*. We never try to deceive \add you with clever arguments, as some other people do\add*. We never \add try to deceive you\add* by changing God's message, \add as those same people do\add*. Instead, we always teach \add people only\add* the truth \add about Christ\add*, and we teach it clearly. Knowing that God is watching what we do, we \add teach his message in an honest way, with the result that\add* no one can \add accuse\add* us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* of being deceitful\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 God gave us this responsibility to carry out, and he also had mercy on us. So we are not downhearted.
\v 2 We are careful not to do anything we would be ashamed of doing, and we have nothing to hide from anyone. We do not promise something that God will not give, and we do not twist God's message to make it say what we want. We proclaim only the truth. In this way, we present ourselves for you to judge us as we stand before God.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 Therefore, because we have this ministry, and just as we have received mercy, we do not become discouraged.
\v 2 Instead, we have renounced the ways that are shameful and hidden. We do not live by craftiness, and we do not mishandle the word of God. By presenting the truth, we recommend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul writes that he is honest in his ministry by preaching Christ, not praising himself. He shows the death and the life of Jesus in how he lives so that life can work in the Corinthian believers.

  * **we have this ministry** - Here the word "we" refers to Paul and his coworker, but not to the Corinthians. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **and just as we have received mercy** - This phrase explains how Paul and his coworkers "have this ministry." It is a gift that God has given to them through his mercy. AT: "because God has shown us mercy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **we have renounced the ways that are shameful and hidden** - This means that that Paul and his coworkers refused to do "shameful and hidden" things. It does not mean that they had done these things in the past.
  * **the ways that are shameful and hidden** - The word "hidden" describes the things that are "shameful." AT: "the ways that are so shameful that people hide them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
  * **live by craftiness** - "live by deception"
  * **we do not mishandle the word of God** - This phrase uses two negative thoughts to express a positive thought. AT: "we use the word of God correctly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **we recommend ourselves to everyone's conscience** - This means that they provide enough evidence for each person who hears them to decide whether they are right or wrong.
  * **in the sight of God** - This refers to God's presence. God's understanding and approval of Paul's truthfulness is referred to as God being able to see them. AT: "before God" or "with God as witness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
