\v 33 He took him aside from the crowd privately, and he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue.
\v 34 He looked up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, "Ephphatha," that is to say, "Open!"
\v 35 And immediately his hearing was opened, and what prevented his tongue was destroyed and he could speak clearly.
