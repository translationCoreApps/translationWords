\v 54 To the larger clans you must give more inheritance, and to the smaller clans you must give less inheritance. To every family you must give an inheritance according to the number of men who were counted.
\v 55 However, the land must be divided by random lots. They must inherit the land as it will be divided among their ancestors' tribes.
\v 56 Their inheritance must be divided among the larger and the smaller clans, distributed to them by random lot."
