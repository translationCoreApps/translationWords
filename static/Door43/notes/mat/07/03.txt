\v 3 None of you should be concerned about someone else's small faults! That would be like noticing a speck of straw in that person's eye. But you should be concerned about your own big faults because you do not notice a huge wooden plank in your own eye.
\v 4 You should not say to other people about their minor faults, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye!' while you still have a wooden plank in your own eye.
\v 5 If you do that, you are a hypocrite! You should first remove the plank out of your own eye before trying to get the speck out of someone else's eye."

\v 3 And why do you look at the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother's eye, but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
\v 4 How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take out the piece of straw that is in your eye,' while the log is in your own eye?
\v 5 You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the piece of straw that is in your brother's eye.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of "you" and "your" are all singular, but you may need to translate them as plurals.

  * **why do you look ... but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?** - Jesus uses this question to challenge the people to pay attention to their own sins before they pay attention to another person's sins. AT: "do not look ... but ignore the log that is in your own eye" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother's eye** - This is a metaphor that refers to the less important faults of a fellow believer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **tiny piece of straw** - "speck" (UDB) or "splinter" or "bit of dust." Use a word for the smallest thing that commonly falls into a person's eyes. 
  * **brother** - All occurrences of "brother" in 7:3-5 refer to a fellow believer, not to a literal brother or a neighbor.
  * **the log that is in your own eye** - This is a metaphor for a person's most important faults. A log could not literally go into a person's eye. Jesus is emphasizing that a person should pay attention to his own more important faults before he deals with another person's less important faults. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **log** - the largest part of a tree that someone has cut down 
  * **How can you say ... your own eye?** - Jesus asks this question to challenge the people to pay attention to their own sins before they pay attention to another person's sins. AT: "You should not say ... your own eye." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
