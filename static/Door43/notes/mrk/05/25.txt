===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Connecting Statement:** - While Jesus is on his way to heal the man's little 12-year-old girl, a woman who has been sick for 12 years interrupts by touching Jesus for her healing.

  * **for twelve years** - "for 12 years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
