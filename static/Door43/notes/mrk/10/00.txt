In this chapter, Jesus teaches about divorce in response to a challenge from the Pharisees. Jesus bases his teaching on God's original intentions in creating marriage. Jesus implicitly shows the mistakes the religious leaders made in their traditions about marriage. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
