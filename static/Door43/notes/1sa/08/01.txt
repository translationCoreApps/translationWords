===== translationNotes: =====

  * **chased after dishonest gain** - The writer speaks of money that people would give Samuel's sons as if it were a person or animal running away from Samuel's sons, and he speaks of Samuel's sons as if they were physically chasing that person or animal. AT: "they worked hard to gain money by being dishonest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **perverted justice** - "judged in favor of those who did evil"
