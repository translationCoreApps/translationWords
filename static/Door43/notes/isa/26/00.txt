====== Isaiah 26 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 26, which is a song to be sung during the reign of Jesus.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "That day" ==
This is a common phrase in this section of Isaiah. This chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the messiah will reign. This chapter pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator should not add explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:restore]], [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:christ]] and [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]])
