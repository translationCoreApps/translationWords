===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Take heed ... you carefully observe ... Call to mind what Yahweh your God** - Moses speaks to the Israelites here as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" and the commands "take heed" and "call to mind" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Take heed regarding any plague of leprosy** - "Pay attention if you suffer from leprosy" or "Pay attention if you have leprosy"
  * **every instruction given to you which the priests, the Levites, teach you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "all of the instructions that I have given you and that the priests, who are Levites, teach you to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **teach you ... you will act ... you were coming out** - Moses here speaks to the Israelites as a group, so these instances of the word "you" are plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **as I commanded them, so you will act** - "you must make sure that you do exactly what I have commanded them"
  * **commanded them** - The word "them" refers to the priests, who are Levites.
  * **Call to mind** - This is an idiom. AT: "Remember" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **as you were coming out of Egypt** - "during the time when you were leaving Egypt"
