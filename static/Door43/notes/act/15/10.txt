\v 10 Why do you want to force the non-Jewish believers to obey our Jewish rituals and laws? Doing that is like putting a heavy burden on them, because it forces them to obey laws that neither our ancestors or we Jews today have ever been able to keep! So then, stop making God angry by doing that!
\v 11 We know that God saves us Jews from our sins because of what the Lord Jesus did for us. God saves us Jews exactly like he saves those non-Jews who believe in the Lord Jesus."

\v 10 Now therefore why do you test God, that you should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
\v 11 But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they were."
