====== Mark 06 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Anointed with oil" ==
In the ancient Near East, this was done for people who were sick.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
Mark uses many rhetorical questions in this chapter to show that people did not understand who Jesus was. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Past Events ==
Parts of this chapter are a sequence of events that have already happen. In a given passage, Mark sometimes writes as if the events have already happened while other events are still in progress (even though they are complete at the time he writes). This can cause difficulty in translation by creating an illogical order of events. It may be necessary to make these consistent by writing as if all the events have already happened.
