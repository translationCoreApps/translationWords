===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he became the father of** - "he had his sons." This does not tell us whether the sons were born on the same day or in different years.
  * **Shem, Ham, and Japheth** - These sons may not be listed in the order of their birth. There is disagreement about which one was the oldest. Avoid translating this in a way that implies that the list is in the order of their ages.
