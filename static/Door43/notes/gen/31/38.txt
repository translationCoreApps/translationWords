\v 38 I was with you for twenty years. In all that time, your sheep and goats have not miscarried\f + \ft Or: always given birth to animals safely \f*. I have not \add killed and\add* eaten any rams from your flocks.
\v 39 When one of your animals was attacked and mauled\f + \ft Or: killed \f* by a wild animal, I did not bring it to you. I replaced the dead animal with a living one of my own animals. Whenever one of your animals was stolen, during the day or during the night, you demanded that I replace it with one of my own animals.
\v 40 I suffered from the heat during the day and from the cold at night. I was often not even able to sleep \f + \ft personification \f*!

<usfm>
\v 38 For twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten any rams from your flocks.
\v 39 What was torn by beasts I did not bring to you. Instead, I bore the loss of it. You always made me pay for every missing animal, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
\v 40 There I was; in the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night; and I went without sleep.
