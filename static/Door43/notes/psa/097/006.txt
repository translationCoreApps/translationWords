===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The skies declare his justice** - The psalmist speaks as if the skies are Yahweh's messengers who declare that Yahweh is just: "Everyone can see that God is just the same way that everyone can see the skies." Another possible meaning is "All those who live in heaven declare that Yahweh is just." (See UDB)
  * **All those who worship carved figures will be shamed, those who boast in worthless idols** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "God will shame all those who boast in worthless idols and worship carved figures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Zion heard ... the towns of Judah** - "The people of Zion heard ... the people of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
