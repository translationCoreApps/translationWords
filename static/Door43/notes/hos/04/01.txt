\v 1 Listen to the message Yahweh has for you.
\q2 "You people of Israel, Yahweh is accusing you, you who live in this place."

\q2 I cannot see anyone who loves me.
\q1 None of you can honestly say that he knows me.
\q1
\v 2 You curse and lie, you kill and steal, and you commit adultery.
\q1 You have broken every law,
\q2 and you commit one murder after another.

\q
\v 1 Hear the word of Yahweh, you people of Israel.
\q Yahweh has a lawsuit against the inhabitants of the land,
\q because there is no truthfulness or covenantal faithfulness, no knowledge of God in the land.
\q
\v 2 There is cursing, lying, killing, stealing and adultery.
\q The people have broken all bounds, and bloodshed comes after bloodshed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This chapter begins Yahweh's argument against the unfaithful Israelites.

  * **Yahweh has a lawsuit against the inhabitants of the land** - Yahweh stating that the people of Israel have sinned against him and broken his covenant is spoken of as if Yahweh were accusing them in court. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **lawsuit** - This is a complaint by one person against another person in a court of law. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:hos:02:02|2:2]].
  * **The people have broken all bounds** - Here "bounds" stands for the limits of what the law allows. AT: "The people have disobeyed the law in every possible way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **bloodshed comes after bloodshed** - Here "bloodshed" stands for "murder" which often involves making the victim bleed. AT: "you commit one murder after another" (UDB) (See:  [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
