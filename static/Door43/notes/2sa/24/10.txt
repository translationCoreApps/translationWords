===== translationNotes: =====
  * **David's heart afflicted him** - The "heart" here is a metonym for David's emotions and conscience. AT: "David felt guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Now, Yahweh, take away your servant's guilt** - David refers to himself as "your servant." This is a polite way to speak to someone with greater authority.
