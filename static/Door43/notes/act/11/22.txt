\v 22 News about them came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem: and they sent out Barnabas as far as Antioch.
\v 23 When he came and saw the gift of God, he was glad; and he encouraged them all to remain with the Lord with all their heart.
\v 24 For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Lord.
