====== Zechariah 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is introduced in prose and shares the fourth vision of the priest in dirty clothes. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:priest]]) 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 3:7-9, which is an extended quotation.

=== Difficult concepts in this chapter ===

== Visions ==
It is important for each of these visions to keep their meanings and not be interpreted to mean any specific thing.  

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== The High Priest ==

This chapter seems to refer to a particular person, Joshua the high priest. However, little is known about him. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:highpriest]])
