\v 10 One time, when the animals were mating, I had a dream. In my dream I looked up and was surprised to see that some of the male goats that were mating with the female goats had black and white stripes on them, some were speckled, and some were spotted.
\v 11 An angel who was sent by God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob!' I replied, 'I am here!'

  * **General Information:** - Jacob continues his story to his wives Leah and Rachel.

  * **Once at the time of breeding season** - "During the breeding season"
  * **mating with the flock** - Here "flock" stands for the female goats. AT: "mating with the female goats of the flock" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **were striped, speckled, and spotted** - "had stripes, little spots, and big spots"
  * **angel of God** - Possible meanings are 1) God himself appeared as a man or 2) one of God's messengers appeared. Since the phrase is not well understood, it is best to simply translate it as "the angel of God," using the normal word that you use for "angel."
