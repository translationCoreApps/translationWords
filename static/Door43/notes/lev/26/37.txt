\v 37 You will stumble over each other as though you were running from the sword, even though no one is chasing you. You will have no power to stand before your enemies.
\v 38 You will perish among the nations, and your enemies' land will itself devour you.
\v 39 Those who are left among you will waste away in their sins, there in your enemies' lands, and because of their fathers' sins they will waste away as well.
