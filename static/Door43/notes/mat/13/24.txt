\v 24 Jesus presented another parable to them. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
\v 25 But while people slept, his enemy came and also sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away.
\v 26 When the blades sprouted and then produced their crop, then the weeds appeared also.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here Jesus describes the kingdom of heaven by telling a parable about a field with both wheat and weeds growing in it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **The kingdom of heaven is like a man** - The translation should not equate the kingdom of heaven to a man, but rather the kingdom of heaven is like the situation described in the parable. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **The kingdom of heaven is like** - Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used only in Matthew. If possible, use "heaven" in your translation. AT: "When our God in heaven shows himself to be king, it will be like" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **good seed** - "good food seeds" or "good grain seeds." The audience probably thought that Jesus was talking about wheat. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **his enemy came** - "his enemy came to the field"
  * **weeds** - These weeds look like food plants when they are young, but their grain is poison. AT: "bad seed" or "weed seeds" (UDB)
  * **When the blades sprouted** - "When the wheat seeds sprouted" or "When the plants came up"
  * **produced their crop** - "produced grain" or "produced the wheat crop"
  * **then the weeds appeared also** - "then people could see there were weeds in the field also"
