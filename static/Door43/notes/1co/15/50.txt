====== 1 Corinthians 15:50-51 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 50 My fellow believers, I want you to know that we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* cannot go \add to heaven, where\add* God rules \add over everything\add*, with our physical bodies, because our bodies \add cannot last forever\add*. They will die and decay.
\v 51 But I will tell you something that \add God\add* has not revealed \add before\add*: \add Some of\add* us \add believers\add* will not die \f + \ft euphemism \f*. However, all of us will be changed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will change all of us \f*.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 50 Now I say this, brothers and sisters, human beings who will die cannot obtain the things that God promises to give all those whom he rules. It is just as the things that die cannot become things that do not die.
\v 51 Look! I tell you something that God has hidden from us. Not all believers will die, but God will change all of us.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

\p
\v 50 Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Neither does what is perishable inherit what is imperishable.
\v 51 Look! I tell you a secret truth: We will not all die, but we will all be changed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul wants them to realize that some believers will not die physically but will still get a resurrected body through Christ's victory.

  * **flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Neither does what is perishable inherit what is imperishable** - Possible meanings are 1) the two sentences mean the same thing. AT: "human beings who will surely die cannot inherit the permanent kingdom of God" or 2) the second sentence finishes the thought begun by the first. AT: "weak human beings cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Neither do those who will certainly die inherit a kingdom that will last forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **flesh and blood** - Those who inhabit a body that is doomed to die. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **inherit** - Receiving what God has promised believers is spoken of as if it were inheriting property and wealth from a family member. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **is perishable ... is imperishable** - "can rot ... cannot rot." See how these words are translated in [[:en:bible:notes:1co:15:42|15:42]].
  * **we will all be changed** - This can be stated as active. AT: "God will change us all" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
