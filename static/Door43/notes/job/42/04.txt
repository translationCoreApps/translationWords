===== translationNotes: =====

  * **but now my eye sees you** - The reader should not understand this to mean that Job literally saw Yahweh. Seeing with the eye is a metonym for understanding. AT: "but now I really understand you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **despise myself** - Job's self is a metonym for what he said. AT: "I despise the things I said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **despise** - "intensely dislike" or "am unhappy with"
  * **I repent in dust and ashes** - It is not clear that Job actually did sit in or cover himself with dust and ashes. This may be a metaphor for being sorry for his sins. AT: "I am so sorry for my sins that I should sit in dust and ashes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
