\v 17 He said to me, "You human, you see \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what they are doing. \add Do you think that\add* it is not important that these men of Judah are doing these detestable things here? \add But they are doing other terrible things\add*. They are acting violently throughout their country, and continually causing me to be angry. Look at them! They are insulting me by their actions [IDI]!
\v 18 So I will show them that I am very angry. I will not pity them or act mercifully toward them. And even if they shout to me \add to help them\add*, I will not pay attention to them."

\v 17 He said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing? Do you think that it is not a serious thing that these men of Judah are doing, worshiping these detestable things here? But they are doing other terrible things. They are acting violently throughout their country, and continually provoking my anger. Look at them! They are insulting me by their actions of false worship!
\v 18 So I will show them that I am very angry. I will not pity them or act mercifully toward them. And even if they shout loudly to me to help them, I will not pay attention to them."

\v 17 He said to me, "Do you see this, son of man? Is it a little thing for the house of Judah to do these abominations that they are doing here? For they have filled the land with violence and they have turned again to provoke me to anger, putting the branch to their noses.
\v 18 So I will also act among them; my eye will not have compassion, and I will not spare them. Though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do you see this ... man?** - Yahweh is commanding Ezekiel to think about what he has just seen. AT: "Think about this ... man." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Is it a little thing for the house of Judah to do these abominations that they are doing here?** - God uses this question to show that he is right to be angry at the people of Judah. AT: "I am right to be angry at the house of Judah because of these abominations that they are doing here." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **house of Judah** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the descendants of Judah over many years. Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Judah people group" or "the people of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they have filled the land with violence** - "throughout the country they are doing violent things or "all over the country they are attacking one another"

The words "branch to ... noses" may be a literal tree branch and  literal noses, or they could be the term for a hand gesture. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
