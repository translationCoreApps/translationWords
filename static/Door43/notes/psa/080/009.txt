===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Asaph continues to speak of the way God settled Israel in their land as if God were a man clearing ground to plant a grapevine. If you need to translate the meaning of the story rather than the story itself, see how the UDB translates it.

  * **You cleared the land for it** - "You cleared the land for the vine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **it took root** - "the vine took root" or "the vine began to grow"
  * **filled the land** - "its branches covered the land"
  * **The mountains were covered with its shade, the cedars of God by its branches** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Its shade covered the mountains, its branches the cedars of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the cedars of God by its branches** - "and the cedars of God were covered by its branches," which copies the verb from the previous sentence. This can be stated in active form. AT: "and its branches covered the cedars of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **cedars of God** - Possible meanings are 1) "the highest cedar trees," the cedar trees that grew on the "mountains" in the land of Lebanon north of Israel, or 2) "God's own cedar trees."
