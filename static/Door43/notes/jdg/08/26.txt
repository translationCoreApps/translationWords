  * **1,700 shekels of gold** - If it is necessary to use modern weight units, here are two ways of doing it. AT: "18.7 kilograms of gold" or "about 20 kilograms of gold" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **crescent ornaments** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:08:20|8:21]].
  * **pendants** - pieces of jewelry that hang at the end of the chains or cords of necklaces
  * **that was worn by the kings of Midian** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that the kings of Midian wore" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
