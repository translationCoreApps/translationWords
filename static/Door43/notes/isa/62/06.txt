===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I have put** - Here "I" may refer to Isaiah or to Yahweh.
  * **watchmen on your walls** - This refers to prophets, officials, or possibly angels, who are constantly praying for the people of Jerusalem like watchmen who constantly guard the city. See how you translated "watchmen" in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:52:07|52:8]] and [[:en:bible:notes:isa:56:09|56:10]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they are not silent day or night** - This means they are continually pleading to Yahweh or calling to each other. AT: "they are earnestly praying to Yahweh throughout the entire day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **Do not allow him to rest** - Here "him" refers to Yahweh.
