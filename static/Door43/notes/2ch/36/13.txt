<usfm>
\v 13 Zedekiah also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear loyalty to him by God. But Zedekiah stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 14 Moreover, all the leaders of the priests and the people were horribly unfaithful, and they followed the disgusting practices of the nations. They polluted the house of Yahweh which he had consecrated in Jerusalem.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **stiffened his neck and hardened his heart** - These two phrases are idiomatic ways to refer to a person's stubbornness. Together they emphasize Zedekiah's rebellion against God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **disgusting practices** - See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:15:08|15:8]] 
  * **polluted the house of Yahweh** - AT: "they made unholy that which was to be holy"
