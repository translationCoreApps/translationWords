====== Psalm 040:5-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 O Yahweh, my God, you have done many wonderful things!
\q2 No one can list all the wonderful things that you have planned for us.
\q1 If I tried to tell \add others\add* about all those wonderful things,
\q1 I would not be able to,
\q2 because there would be too many for me to mention.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Various kinds of sacrifices and other offerings are not the \add only\add* things that delight you.
\q2 You have enabled me to understand that very well [IDI].
\q1 \add Animals\add* burned \add on the altar\add* and other offerings
\q2 are not all that you require \add for sins to be forgiven\add*.
\q1

\q
\v 5 Many, Yahweh my God, are the wonderful deeds that you have done,
\q and your thoughts which are about us cannot be numbered;
\q if I declared and spoke of them,
\q they would be more than could be counted.
\q
\v 6 You have no delight in sacrifice or offering,
\q but you have opened my ears;
\q you have not required burnt offerings or sin offerings.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **your thoughts which are about us cannot be numbered** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one can count all the things you think about us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **cannot be numbered ... more than could be counted** - These phrases mean essentially the same thing. The first is stated in negative form, and the second is stated in positive form. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **You have no delight in sacrifice or offering** - This is an exaggeration to show that these things were not the most important to God. AT: "Sacrifices and other offerings are not the things that delight you most" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **you have opened my ears** - Here "ears" refers to the ability to hear. AT: "you have enabled me to hear your commands" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **you have not required burnt offerings or sin offerings** - This is an exaggeration to show that these things were not the most important to God. AT: "animals burned on the altar and other offerings for our sins are not what you require most" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
