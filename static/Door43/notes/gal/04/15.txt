\v 15 But now you are no longer happy! I know for certain that you would have done anything to help me. You would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me, if that would have helped me!
\v 16 That is why I have become so sad now. You seem to think that I have become your enemy because I have continued to tell the truth about Christ to you.

<usfm>
\v 15 Where, then, is your blessing now? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me.
\v 16 So then, have I become your enemy because I am telling you the truth?
