\v 42 The king took from his finger the ring that had his seal on it, and he put it on Joseph's finger. He put robes made of fine linen on him, and he put a gold chain around his neck.
\v 43 Then he arranged for Joseph to ride around in the chariot that showed that he was the second-most important man in the country. When Joseph rode in the chariot, men shouted to the people who were on the road in front of him, "Get off the road!" So the king put Joseph in charge of everything in the country.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Pharaoh took off his signet ring ... gold chain on his neck** - All of these actions symbolize that Pharaoh is giving Joseph the authority to do everything that Joseph planned. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **signet ring** - This ring had Pharaoh's seal engraved on it. This gave Joseph the authority and money needed to carry out his plans.
  * **clothes of fine linen** - "Linen" is a smooth, strong cloth made from the blue-flowered flax plant.
  * **He had him ride in the second chariot which he possessed** - This act makes clear to the people that Joseph is second only to Pharaoh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **Bend the knee** - "Bow down and honor Joseph." To bend the knee and bow down was a sign of honor and respect. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **Pharaoh put him over all the land** - The phrase "put you over" means to give authority. Here "land" refers to the people. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:41:39|41:41]]. AT: "I put you in charge of everyone in Egypt"(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
