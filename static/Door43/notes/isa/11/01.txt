===== translationNotes: =====

  * **A shoot will sprout from the stump of Jesse ... a branch out of his roots will bear fruit** - Isaiah speaks of Jesse and his descendants as if they were a tree that had been cut down. Both of these phrases tell about a descendant of Jesse who would be king. AT: "As a shoot sprouts out of a tree stump, so a descendant of Jesse will become king over what remains of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the stump of Jesse** - A stump is what remains of a tree after it is chopped down. The "stump of Jesse" represents what was left of the kingdom that Jesse's son David was once king of. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The Spirit of Yahweh will rest upon him** - Resting upon him represents being with him and helping him. The word "him" refers to the one who would become king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the spirit of wisdom ... the spirit of instruction ... the spirit of knowledge ... the fear of Yahweh** - Here the word "spirit" refers to an ability or quality that the Spirit of Yahweh would give him. AT: "and he will cause him to have wisdom and understanding, instruction and might, knowledge and the fear of Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
