\v 23 Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion which I gave to you, of which I said to you, 'Put it aside.'"
\v 24 So the cook took the thigh that had been raised in sacrifice and what was with it, and set it before Saul. Then Samuel said, "See what has been kept for you. Eat it, because it has been kept until the appointed time for you. For now you can say, 'I have invited the people.'" So Saul ate with Samuel that day.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the thigh that had been raised in sacrifice** - The priest who raises the thigh in sacrifice is the one who is supposed to eat it. That Samuel had Saul eat it shows that being a king was a sacred duty. This can be translated in active form. AT: "the thigh of the bull that the priest had raised when he offered the sacrifice" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **what was with it** - Possible meanings are 1) the other food that Saul was to eat along with the meat or 2) other parts of the bull.
  * **Then Samuel said** - Another possible meaning is "Then the cook said."
  * **For now you can say, 'I have invited the people.'** - Possible meanings are 1) Saul can say that he has invited the people or 2) Samuel has invited the people (UDB).
