===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the nations.

  * **Let the nations wake themselves ... all the surrounding nations** - The words "the nations" and "the surrounding nations" refer to the same nations that surround Judah. Yahweh will judge them in the valley of Jehoshaphat for what they have done to Jerusalem.
  * **Put in the sickle ... the winepress is full** - Possible meanings are that 1) the attack on the sinful nations is like harvesting grain and crushing grapes, or 2) the urgency of judging the sinful nations is like the urgency of collecting ripe crops and crushing grapes.
  * **Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe** - Yahweh speaks of the nations as if they were a field of crops that were ripe for harvesting. AT: "Put in the sickle, for the nations are like a ripe harvest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Put in the sickle** - "Swing the sickle to cut the grain"
  * **sickle** - a long curved knife that people use for cutting grain
  * **the harvest is ripe** - "the grain is ready to be harvested"
  * **Come, crush the grapes, for the winepress is full** - Yahweh speaks of the nations as if they were a bunch of grapes in a winepress, ready for people to crush them. AT: "Come, crush the nations, for they are like grapes in a winepress" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The vats overflow, for their wickedness is enormous** - Yahweh speaks of the nations' wickedness as if it was the juice that flowed from the winepress into the vats that collected it. The vats are not large enough to contain the amount of wickedness that flows into them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
