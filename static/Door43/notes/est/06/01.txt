===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Bigthana and Teresh** - These are the names of two men. They were spoken of in [[:en:bible:notes:est:02:19|2:21]], but Bigthana's name was spelled "Bigthan" there. You may translate his name as you did there or according to how it is spelled in this verse. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **It was found recorded there** - Here "found" is an metaphor for learning. Both "found" and "recorded" can be expressed in active form. AT: "They found that the writers had recorded there" or "They learned that the writers had written" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **What was done to give honor** - This can be expressed in active form. AT: "What did I do to give honor" or "What did we do to give honor " (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Nothing was done for him** - This can be expressed in active form. However it may be good to find a way that does not give the impression that servants were accusing the king. AT: "No one did anything for Mordecai" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
