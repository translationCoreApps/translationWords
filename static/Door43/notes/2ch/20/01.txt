\v 1 It came about after this, that the people of Moab and Ammon, and with them some Meunites came against Jehoshaphat to do battle.
\f + \ft The reading \fqa some Meunites \fqb represents a correction to the Hebrew text, which reads, \fqa some Ammonites \fqb . It is thought that \fqa Meunites \fqb was original, and that a copyist changed it to \fqa some Ammonites \fqb . But this last reading makes no sense, because Ammonites have already been mentioned in this verse. However, different versions deal with this problem in different ways. \f*
\v 2 Then some came who told Jehoshaphat, saying, "A large multitude is coming against you from beyond the Dead Sea, from Edom. See, they are in Hazazontamar," that is, Engedi.
 \f + \ft Instead of \fqa Edom \fqb , some ancient and modern versions read, \fqa Aram \fqb . \f*
