===== translationNotes: =====

  * **stood** - "were standing there"
  * **him** - This refers to Jesus.
  * **He saved others. Let him save himself** - Luke records the ironic words of the rulers. The only way Jesus could save others was by dying instead of saving himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **Let him save himself** - "Jesus should be able to save himself." They said this to mock Jesus. They did not believe he could save himself. AT: "We would like to see him prove who he is by saving himself from the cross"
  * **the chosen one** - "the one that God has chosen"
