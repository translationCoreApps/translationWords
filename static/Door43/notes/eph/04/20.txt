\v 20 But when you learned about Christ you did not learn to live like that.
\v 21 Now that you have heard about Jesus and he has taught you, you know that his way is the true way to live.
\v 22 Jesus taught that you must stop living the way you used to live. You were like corpses that were decaying because you were deceiving yourselves with what you desired.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 But that is not how you learned about Christ.
\v 21 I assume that you have heard about him, and that you were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus.
\v 22 You were taught to put off what belongs to your former manner of life, to put off the old man. It is the old man that is corrupt because of its deceitful desires.
