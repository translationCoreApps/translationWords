\v 21 Jesus also said to them, "I \add will soon be\add* going away. Then \add at the end of your life\add* you will seek me, but you will die \add without God forgiving\add* your sins. Where I will go, you will not be able to come."
\v 22 So the Jewish \add leaders\add* said among themselves, "Is he going to kill himself? Is that the reason that he said, 'Where I go, you will not be able to come'?"

\v 21 Jesus also said to them, "I am going away, and you will seek me, but it is certain that you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come."
\v 22 His Jewish opponents said among themselves, "Perhaps he is thinking that he will kill himself, and that is what he means when he says, 'Where I am going you cannot come.'"
