====== Isaiah 52:2-3 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 2 People of Jerusalem, get up from sitting in the dust
\q2 and sit in places where people are honored!
\q1 You people who have returned from being exiled,
\q2 take off from your neck the chains which were fastened around you \add in Babylonia\add*,
\p
\v 3 because this is what Yahweh says:
\q1 "\add When you were taken to Babylonia\add*,
\q2 no one paid me for doing that.
\q1 So now I will bring you back
\q2 without \add being required to\add* pay for you!"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 2 People of Jerusalem, get up from where you have been sitting in the dust,
\q2 and sit down properly!
\q1 You people who have returned from being exiled,
\q2 take off from your neck the chains that the Babylonians fastened around your necks,
\p
\v 3 because this is what Yahweh says:
\q1 "When you were sent as captives to Babylonia,
\q2 no one paid to make that happen.
\q1 So now you will be brought back,
\q2 and no money will be paid to anyone for your release."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Shake yourself off from the dust; arise and sit, Jerusalem** - Here "Jerusalem" represents the people who live there. AT: "People of Jerusalem, sit up and shake the dirt off of yourself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **take off the chain from your neck, captive** - It is implied that the people of Jerusalem were wearing chains because they were slaves while exiled in Babylon. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **daughter of Zion** - This is an idiom. The "daughter" of a city means the people of the city. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "people of Zion" or "people who live in Zion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **You were sold for nothing, and you will be redeemed without money** - This speaks about Yahweh as if he were the owner of the people of Israel. Since he is the rightful owner he can give them away or take them back whenever he wants. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I sold you for nothing, and I will redeem you without money" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
