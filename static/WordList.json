These messages included instructions about what God wanted the people to do.\n* Angels also told people about events that were going to happen in the future or events that had already happened.\n* Angels have God's authority as his representatives and sometimes in the Bible they spoke as if God himself was speaking.\n* Other ways that angels serve God are by protecting and strengthening people.\n* A special phrase, \"angel of Yahweh,\" has more than one possible meaning: 1) It may mean \"angel who represents Yahweh\" or \"messenger who serves Yahweh.\" 2) It may refer to Yahweh himself, who looked like an angel as he talked to a person. Either one of these meanings would explain the angel's use of \"I\" as if Yahweh himself was talking.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* Ways to translate \"angel\" could include \"messenger from God\" or \"God's heavenly servant\" or \"God's spirit messenger.\"\n* The term \"archangel\" could be translated as \"chief angel\" or \"head ruling angel\" or \"leader of the angels.\"\n* Also consider how these terms are translated in a national language or another local language.\n* The phrase \"angel of Yahweh\" should be translated using the words for \"angel\" and \"Yahweh.\" This will allow for different interpretations of that phrase.

It was at that point that Adam became a living soul.\n* When Jesus breathed on the disciples and told them to \"receive the Spirit,\" he was probably literally breathing out air onto them to symbolize the Holy Spirit coming to them.\n* Sometimes the terms \"breathing\" and \"breathing out\" are used to refer to speaking.\n* The figurative expression \"breath of God\" or \"breath of Yahweh\" often refers to God's wrath being poured out on rebellious or godless nations. It communicates his power.\n\n## Translation Suggestions ##\n\n* The expression \"breathed his last\" is a figurative way of saying \"he died.\" It could also be translated as \"he took his last breath\" or \"he stopped breathing and died\" or \"he breathed in air one last time.\"\n* Describing the Scriptures as \"God-breathed\" means that God spoke or inspired the words of the Scriptures which human authors then wrote down. It is probably best, if possible, to translate \"God-breathed\" somewhat literally since it is difficult to communicate the exact meaning of this.\n* If a literal translation of \"God-breathed\" is not acceptable, other ways to translate this could include \"inspired by God\" or \"authored by God\" or \"spoken by God.\" It could also be said that \"God breathed out the words of Scripture.\"\n* The expressions \"put breath in\" or \"breathe life into\" or \"gives breath to\" could be translated as \"cause to breathe\" or \"make alive again\" or \"enable them to live and breathe\" or \"give life to.\"\n* If possible, it is best to translate \"breath of God\" with the literal word that is used for \"breath\" in the language. If God cannot be said to have \"breath,\" this could be translated as \"God's power\" or \"God's speech.\"\n* The expression \"catch my breath\" or \"get my breath\" could be translated as \"relax in order to breathe more slowly\" or \"stop running in order to breathe normally.\"\n* The expression \"is only a breath\" means \"lasts a very short time.\"\n* Similarly the expression \"man is a single breath\" means \"people live a very short time\" or \"the lives of human beings are very short, like a single breath\" or \"compared to God, the life of a person seems as short as the time it takes to breathe in one breath of air.\"\n\n(See also: [Adam](../other/adam.md), [Paul](../other/paul.md), [word of God](../kt/wordofgod.md), [life](../kt/life.md))\n\n## Bible References: ##\n\n* [1 Kings 17:17-18](en/tn/1ki/help/17/17)\n* [Ecclesiastes 08:8-9](en/tn/ecc/help/08/08)\n* [Job 04:7-9](en/tn/job/help/04/07)\n* [Revelation 11:10-12](en/tn/rev/help/11/10)\n* [Revelation 13:15-17](en/tn/rev/help/13/15)",

For example, James emphasizes that he is talking about all believers when he refers to \"a brother or sister who is in need of food or clothing.\"\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* It is best to translate this term with the literal word that is used in the target language to refer to a natural or biological brother, unless this would give wrong meaning.\n* In the Old Testament especially, when \"brothers\" is used very generally to refer to members of the same family, clan, or people group, possible translations could include \"relatives\" or \"clan members\" or \"fellow Israelites.\"\n* In the context of referring to a fellow believer in Christ, this term could be translated as \"brother in Christ\" or \"spiritual brother.\"\n* If both males and females are being referred to and \"brother\" would give a wrong meaning, then a more general kinship term could be used that would include both males and females.\n* Other ways to translate this term so that it refers to both male and female believers could be \"fellow believers\" or \"Christian brothers and sisters.\"\n* Make sure to check the context to determine whether only men are being referred to, or whether both men and women are included.\n\n(See also: [apostle](../kt/apostle.md), [God the Father](../kt/godthefather.md), [sister](../other/sister.md), [spirit](../kt/spirit.md))\n\n## Bible References: ##\n\n* [Acts 07:26-28](en/tn/act/help/07/26)\n* [Genesis 29:9-10](en/tn/gen/help/29/09)\n* [Leviticus 19:17-18](en/tn/lev/help/19/17)\n* [Nehemiah 03:1-2](en/tn/neh/help/03/01)\n* [Philippians 04:21-23](en/tn/php/help/04/21)\n* [Revelation 01:9-11](en/tn/rev/help/01/09)",

Spiritually, it refers to sinners being separated from a holy God because of their sin.\n\n## 1. Physical death ####\n\n* To \"die\" means to stop living. Death is the end of physical life.\n* A person's spirit leaves his body when he dies.\n* When Adam and Eve sinned, physical death came into the world.\n* The expression \"put to death\" refers to killing or murdering someone, especially when a king or other ruler gives an order for someone to be killed.\n\n## 2. Spiritual death ####\n\n* Spiritual death is the separation of a person from God.\n* Adam died spiritually when he disobeyed God. His relationship with God was broken. He became ashamed and tried to hide from God.\n* Every descendant of Adam is a sinner, and is spiritually dead. God makes us spiritually alive again when we have faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* To translate this term, it is best to use the everyday, natural word or expression in the target language that refers to death.\n* In some languages, \"to die\" may be expressed as \"to not live.\" The term \"dead\" may be translated as \"not alive\" or \"not having any life\" or \"not living.\"\n* Many languages use figurative expressions to describe death, such as \"to pass away\" in English. However, in the Bible it is best to use the most direct term for death that is used in everyday language.\n* In the Bible, physical life and death are often compared to spiritual life and death. It is important in a translation to use the same word or phrase for both physical death and spiritual death.\n* In some languages it may be more clear to say \"spiritual death\" when the context requires that meaning. Some translators may also feel it is best to say \"physical death\" in contexts where it is being contrasted to spiritual death.\n* The expression \"the dead\" is a nominal adjective that refers to people who have died. Some languages will translate this as \"dead people\" or \"people who have died.\"  (See: [nominal adjective](en/ta-vol1/translate/man/figs-nominaladj))\n* The expression \"put to death\" could also be translated as \"kill\" or \"murder\" or \"execute.\"\n\n(See also: [believe](../kt/believe.md), [faith](../kt/faith.md), [life](../kt/life.md), [spirit](../kt/spirit.md))\n\n## Bible References: ##\n\n* [1 Corinthians 15:20-21](en/tn/1co/help/15/20)\n* [1 Thessalonians 04:16-18](en/tn/1th/help/04/16)\n* [Acts 10:42-43](en/tn/act/help/10/42)\n* [Acts 14:19-20](en/tn/act/help/14/19)\n* [Colossians 02:13-15](en/tn/col/help/02/13)\n* [Colossians 02:20-23](en/tn/col/help/02/20)\n* [Genesis 02:15-17](en/tn/gen/help/02/15)\n* [Genesis 34:27-29](en/tn/gen/help/34/27)\n* [Matthew 16:27-28](en/tn/mat/help/16/27)\n* [Romans 05:10-11](en/tn/rom/help/05/10)\n* [Romans 05:12-13](en/tn/rom/help/05/12)\n* [Romans 06:10-11](en/tn/rom/help/06/10)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories: ##\n\n* __[01:11](en/tn/obs/help/01/11)__ God told Adam that he could eat from any tree in the garden except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

It is often used to refer to God appointing people to belong to him and to serve him.\n* To be \"chosen\" means to be \"selected\" or \"appointed\" to be or do something.\n* God chose people to be holy, to be set apart by him for the purpose of bearing good spiritual fruit. That is why they are called \"the chosen (ones) or \"the elect.\"\n* The term \"chosen one\" is sometimes used in the Bible to refer to certain people such as Moses and King David whom God had appointed as leaders over his people. It is also used to refer to the nation of Israel as God's chosen people.\n* The phrase \"the elect\" is an older term that literally means \"the chosen ones\" or \"the chosen people.\" This phrase in the original language is plural when referring to believers in Christ.\n* In older English Bible versions, the term \"elect\" is used in both the Old and New Testaments to translate the word for \"chosen one(s).\" More modern versions use \"elect\" only in the New Testament, to refer to people who have been saved by God through faith in Jesus. Elsewhere in the Bible text, they translate this word more literally as \"chosen ones.\"\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* It is best to translate \"elect\" with a word or phrase that means \"chosen ones\" or \"chosen people.\" This could also be translated as \"people whom God chose\" or \"the ones God appointed to be his people.\"\n* The phrase \"who were chosen\" could also be translated as \"who were appointed\" or \"who were selected\" or \"whom God chose.\"\n* \"I chose you\" could be translated as \"I appointed you\" or \"I selected you.\"\n* In reference to Jesus, \"Chosen One\" could also be translated as \"God's chosen One\" or \"God's specially appointed Messiah\" or \"the One God appointed (to save people).\"\n\n(See also: [appoint](../kt/appoint.md), [Christ](../kt/christ.md))\n\n## Bible References: ##\n\n* [2 John 01:1-3](en/tn/2jn/help/01/01)\n* [Colossians 03:12-14](en/tn/col/help/03/12)\n* [Ephesians 01:3-4](en/tn/eph/help/01/03)\n* [Isaiah 65:22-23](en/tn/isa/help/65/22)\n* [Luke 18:6-8](en/tn/luk/help/18/06)\n* [Matthew 24:19-22](en/tn/mat/help/24/19)\n* [Romans 08:33-34](en/tn/rom/help/08/33)",

Older English Bible versions call this \"fornication.\"\n\n* This term can refer to any kind of sexual activity that is against God's will, including homosexual acts and pornography.\n* One type of sexual immorality is adultery, which is sexual activity specifically between a married person and someone who is not that person's spouse.\n* Another type of sexual immorality is \"prostitution,\" which involves being paid to have sex with someone.\n* This term is also used figuratively to refer to Israel's unfaithfulness to God when they worshiped false gods.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* The term \"sexual immorality\" could be translated as \"immorality\" as long as the correct meaning of the term is understood.\n* Other ways to translate this term could include \"wrong sexual acts\" or \"sex outside of marriage.\"\n* This term should be translated in a different way from the term \"adultery.\"\n* The translation of this term's figurative uses should retain the literal term if possible since there is a common comparison in the Bible between unfaithfulness to God and unfaithfulness in the sexual relationship.\n\n(See also: [adultery](../kt/adultery.md), [false god](../kt/falsegod.md), [prostitute](../other/prostitute.md), [unfaithful](../kt/unfaithful.md))\n\n## Bible References: ##\n\n* [Acts 15:19-21](en/tn/act/help/15/19)\n* [Acts 21:25-26](en/tn/act/help/21/25)\n* [Colossians 03:5-8](en/tn/col/help/03/05)\n* [Ephesians 05:3-4](en/tn/eph/help/05/03)\n* [Genesis 38:24-26](en/tn/gen/help/38/24)\n* [Hosea 04:13-14](en/tn/hos/help/04/13)\n* [Matthew 05:31-32](en/tn/mat/help/05/31)\n* [Matthew 19:7-9](en/tn/mat/help/19/07)",

These terms are also used figuratively in the Bible.\n\n* The Bible often uses \"fruit\" to refer to a person's actions. Just as fruit on a tree shows what kind of tree it is, in the same way a person's words and actions reveal what his character is like.\n* A person can produce good or bad spiritual fruit, but the term \"fruitful\" always has the positive meaning of producing much good fruit.\n* The term \"fruitful\" is also used figuratively to mean \"prosperous.\" This often refers to having many children and descendants, as well as having plenty of food and other wealth.\n* In general, the expression \"fruit of\" refers to anything that comes from or that is produced by something else. For example, the \"fruit of wisdom\" refers to the good things that come from being wise.\n* The expression \"fruit of the land\" refers generally to everything that the land produces for people to eat. This includes not only fruits such as grapes or dates, but also vegetables, nuts, and grains.\n* The figurative expression \"fruit of the Spirit\" refers to godly qualities that the Holy Spirit produces in the lives of people who obey him.\n* The expression \"fruit of the womb\" refers to \"what the womb produces--\"that is children.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* It is best to translate this term using the general word for \"fruit\" that is commonly used in the project language to refer to the edible fruit of a fruit tree. In many languages it may be more natural to use the plural ,\"fruits\" whenever it refers to more than one fruit.\n* Depending on the context, the term \"fruitful\" could be translated as \"producing much spiritual fruit\" or \"having many children\" or \"prosperous.\"\n* The expression \"fruit of the land\" could also be translated as \"food that the land produces\" or \"food crops that are growing in that region.\"\n* When God created animals and people, he commanded them to \"be fruitful and multiply,\" which refers to having many offspring. This could also be translated as \"have many offspring\" or \"have many children and descendants\" or \"have many children so that you will have many descendants.\"\n* The expression \"fruit of the womb\" could be translated as \"what the womb produces\" or \"children a women gives birth to\" or just \"children.\" When Elizabeth says to Mary \"blessed is the fruit of your womb,\" she means \"blessed is the child you will give birth to.\" The project language may also have a different expression for this.\n* Another expression \"fruit of the vine,\" could be translated as \"vine fruit\" or \"grapes.\"\n* Depending on the context, the expression \"will be more fruitful\" could also be translated as \"will produce more fruit\" or \"will have more children\" or \"will be prosperous.\"\n* The apostle Paul's expression \"fruitful labor\" could be translated as \"work that brings very good results\" or \"efforts that result in many people believing in Jesus.\"\n* The \"fruit of the Spirit\" could also be translated as \"works that the Holy Spirit produces\" or \"words and actions that show that the Holy Spirit is working in someone.\"\n\n(See also: [descendant](../other/descendant.md), [grain](../other/grain.md), [grape](../other/grape.md), [Holy Spirit](../kt/holyspirit.md), [vine](../other/vine.md), [womb](../other/womb.md))\n\n## Bible References: ##\n\n* [Galatians 05:22-24](en/tn/gal/help/05/22)\n* [Genesis 01:11-13](en/tn/gen/help/01/11)\n* [Luke 08:14-15](en/tn/luk/help/08/14)\n* [Matthew 03:7-9](en/tn/mat/help/03/07)\n* [Matthew 07:15-17](en/tn/mat/help/07/15)",

It means that it is actually very certain that it will not happen.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* In some contexts, the term \"to hope\" could also be translated as \"to wish\" or \"to desire\" or \"to expect.\"\n* The expression \"nothing to hope for\" could be translated as \"nothing to trust in\" or \"no expectation of anything good\"\n* To \"have no hope\" could be translated as \"have no expectation of anything good\" or \"have no security\" or \"be sure that nothing good will happen.\"\n* The expression \"have set your hopes on\" could also be translated as \"have put your confidence in\" or \"have been trusting in.\"\n* The phrase \"I find hope in your Word\" could also be translated as \"I am confident that your Word is true\" or \"Your Word helps me trust in you\" or \"When I obey your Word, I am certain to be blessed.\"\n* Phrases such as \"hope in\" God could also be translated a, \"trust in God\" or \"know for sure that God will do what he has promised\" or \"be certain that God is faithful.\"\n\n(See also: [bless](../kt/bless.md), [confidence](../kt/confidence.md), [good](../kt/good.md), [obey](../other/obey.md), [trust](../kt/trust.md), [word of God](../kt/wordofgod.md))\n\n## Bible References: ##\n\n* [1 Chronicles 29:14-15](en/tn/1ch/help/29/14)\n* [1 Thessalonians 02:17-20](en/tn/1th/help/02/17)\n* [Acts 24:14-16](en/tn/act/help/24/14)\n* [Acts 26:6-8](en/tn/act/help/26/06)\n* [Acts 27:19-20](en/tn/act/help/27/19)\n* [Colossians 01:4-6](en/tn/col/help/01/04)\n* [Job 11:20](en/tn/job/help/11/20)\n\n~review~DISCUSSION~~",

It also refers to the realm or political regions over which a king or other ruler has control and authority.\n\n* A kingdom can be of any geographical size. A king might govern a nation or country or only one city.\n* The term \"kingdom\" can also refer to a spiritual reign or authority, as in the term \"kingdom of God.\"\n* God is the ruler of all creation, but the term \"kingdom of God\" especially refers to his reign and authority over the people who have believed in Jesus and who have submitted to his authority.\n* The Bible also talks about Satan having a \"kingdom\" in which he temporarily rules over many things on this earth. His kingdom is evil and is referred to as \"darkness.\"\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* When referring to a physical region that is ruled over by a king, the term \"kingdom\" could be translated as, \"country (ruled by a king)\" or \"king's territory\" or \"region ruled by a king.\"\n* In a spiritual sense, \"kingdom\" could be translated as \"ruling\" or \"reigning\" or \"controlling\" or \"governing.\"\n* One way to translate \"kingdom of priests\" might be, \"spiritual priests who are ruled by God.\"\n* The phrase, \"kingdom of light\" could be translated as, \"God's reign that is good like light\" or \"when God, who is light, rules people\" or \"the light and goodness of God's kingdom.\" It is best to keep the word \"light\" in this expression since that is a very important term in the Bible.\n* Note that the term \"kingdom\" is different from an empire, in which an emperor rules over several countries.\n\n(See also: [authority](../other/authority.md) **·** [king](../other/king.md) **·** [kingdomofgod](../kt/kingdomofgod.md) **·** [kingdomofisrael](../other/kingdomofisrael.md) **·** [judah](../other/judah.md) **·** [kingdomofjudah](../other/kingdomofjudah.md) **·** [priest](../kt/priest.md))\n\n## ",

(See: [metonymy](en/ta-vol1/translate/man/figs-metonymy)) \n* In the New Testament book that Matthew wrote, he referred to God's kingdom as \"the kingdom of heaven,\" probably because he was writing primarily for a Jewish audience.\n* The kingdom of God refers to God ruling people spiritually as well as ruling over the physical world.\n* The Old Testament prophets said that God would send the Messiah to rule with righteousness. Jesus, the Son of God, is the Messiah who will rule over God's kingdom forever.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* Depending on the context, \"kingdom of God\" can be translated as \"God's rule (as king)\" or \"when God reigns as king\" or \"God's rule over everything.\"\n* The term \"kingdom of heaven\" could also be translated as \"God's rule from heaven as king\" or \"God in heaven reigning\" or \"heaven's reign\" or \"heaven ruling over everything.\" If it is not possible to translate this simply and clearly, the phrase \"kingdom of God\" could be translated instead.\n* Some translators may prefer to capitalize \"Heaven\" to show that it refers to God. Others may include a note in the text, such as \"kingdom of heaven (that is, 'of God').\"\n* A footnote at the bottom of the page of a printed Bible may also be used to explain the meaning of \"heaven\" in this expression.\n\n(See also: [God](../kt/god.md), [heaven](../kt/heaven.md), [king](../other/king.md), [kingdom](../other/kingdom.md), [King of the Jews](../kt/kingofthejews.md), [reign](../other/reign.md))\n\n## Bible References: ##\n\n* [2 Thessalonians 01:3-5](en/tn/2th/help/01/03)\n* [Acts 08:12-13](en/tn/act/help/08/12)\n* [Acts 28:23-24](en/tn/act/help/28/23)\n* [Colossians 04:10-11](en/tn/col/help/04/10)\n* [John 03:3-4](en/tn/jhn/help/03/03)\n* [Luke 07:27-28](en/tn/luk/help/07/27)\n* [Luke 10:8-9](en/tn/luk/help/10/08)\n* [Luke 12:31-32](en/tn/luk/help/12/31)\n* [Matthew 03:1-3](en/tn/mat/help/03/01)\n* [Matthew 04:17](en/tn/mat/help/04/17)\n* [Matthew 05:9-10](en/tn/mat/help/05/09)\n* [Romans 14:16-17](en/tn/rom/help/14/16)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories: ##\n\n* __[24:02](en/tn/obs/help/24/02)__ He (John) preached to them, saying, \"Repent, for the __kingdom of God__  is near!\"\n* __[28:06](en/tn/obs/help/28/06)__ Then Jesus said to his disciples, \"It is extremely hard for rich people to enter into the __kingdom of God__!

They are also used figuratively to refer to being alive spiritually. The following discusses what is meant by \"physical life\" and \"spiritual life.\"\n\n## 1. Physical life ####\n\n* Physical life is the presence of the spirit in the body. God breathed life into Adam's body, and he became a living being.\n* A \"life\" can also refer to an individual person as in \"a life was saved\".\n* Sometimes the word \"life\" refers to the experience of living as in, \"his life was enjoyable.\"\n* It can also refer to a person's lifespan, as in the expression, \"the end of his life.\"\n* The term \"living\" may refer to being physically alive, as in \"my mother is still living.\" It may also refer to dwelling somewhere as in, \"they were living in the city.\"\n* In the Bible, the concept of \"life\" is often contrasted with the concept of \"death.\"\n\n## 2. Spiritual life ####\n\n* A person has spiritual life when he believes in Jesus with God gives that person a transformed life with the Holy Spirit living in him.\n* This life is also called \"eternal life\" to indicate that it does not end.\n* The opposite of spiritual life is spiritual death, which means being separated from God and experiencing eternal punishment.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* Depending on the context, \"life\" can be translated as \"existence\" or \"person\" or \"soul\" or \"being\" or \"experience.\"\n* The term \"live\" could be translated by \"dwell\" or \"reside\" or \"exist.\"\n* The expression \"end of his life\" could be translated as \"when he stopped living.\"\n* The expression \"spared their lives' could be translated as \"allowed them to live\" or \"did not kill them.\"\n* The expression \"they risked their lives\" could be translated as \"they put themselves in danger\" or \"they did something that could have killed them.\" \n* When the Bible text talks about being alive spiritually, \"life\" could be translated as \"spiritual life\" or \"eternal life,\" depending on the context.\n* The concept of \"spiritual life\" could also be translated as \"God making us alive in our spirits\" or \"new life by God's Spirit\" or \"being made alive in our inner self.\"\n* Depending on the context, the expression \"give life\" could also be translated as \"cause to live\" or \"give eternal life\" or \"cause to live eternally.\"\n\n(See also: [death](../kt/death.md), [everlasting](../kt/eternity.md))\n\n## Bible References: ##\n\n* [2 Peter 01:3-4](en/tn/2pe/help/01/03)\n* [Acts 10:42-43](en/tn/act/help/10/42)\n* [Genesis 02:7-8](en/tn/gen/help/02/07)\n* [Genesis 07:21-22](en/tn/gen/help/07/21)\n* [Hebrews 10:19-22](en/tn/heb/help/10/19)\n* [Jeremiah 44:1-3](en/tn/jer/help/44/01)\n* [John 01:4-5](en/tn/jhn/help/01/04)\n* [Judges 02:18-19](en/tn/jdg/help/02/18)\n* [Luke 12:22-23](en/tn/luk/help/12/22)\n* [Matthew 07:13-14](en/tn/mat/help/07/13)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories: ##\n\n* __[01:10](en/tn/obs/help/01/10)__ So God took some dirt, formed it into a man, and breathed __life__  into him.\n* __[03:01](en/tn/obs/help/03/01)__ After a long time, many people were __living __  in the world.\n* __[08:13](en/tn/obs/help/08/13)__ When Joseph's brothers returned home and told their father, Jacob, that Joseph was still __alive__, he was very happy.\n* __[17:09](en/tn/obs/help/17/09)__ However, toward the end of his [David's] __life__  he sinned terribly before God.\n* __[27:01](en/tn/obs/help/27/01)__ One day, an expert in the Jewish law came to Jesus to test him, saying, \"Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal __life__?\"\n* __[35:05](en/tn/obs/help/35/05)__ Jesus replied, \"I am the Resurrection and the __Life__.\"\n* __[44:05](en/tn/obs/help/44/05)__ \"You are the ones who told the Roman governor to kill Jesus.

(See: [Metaphor](en/ta-vol1/translate/man/figs-metaphor))\n\n* Jesus said, \"I am the light of the world\" to express that he brings God's true message to the world and rescues people from the darkness of their sin.\n* Christians are commanded to \"walk in the light,\" which means they should be living the way God wants them to and avoiding evil.\n* The apostle John stated that \"God is light,\" and there is no darkness in him.\n* Light and darkness are complete opposites. Darkness is the absence of all light. \n* Jesus said that he was \"the light of the world\" and that his followers should shine like lights in the world by living in a way that clearly shows how great God is.\n* \"Walking in the light\" represents living in a way that pleases God, doing what is good and right. Walking in darkness represents living in rebellion against God, doing evil things.\n \n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* When translating, it is important to keep the literal terms \"light\" and \"darkness\" even when they are used figuratively.\n* It may be necessary to explain the comparison in the text. For example, \"walk as children of light\" could be translated as, \"live openly righteous lives, like someone who walks in bright sunlight.\"\n* Make sure that the translation of \"light\" does not refer to an object that gives light, such as a lamp. The translation of this term should refer to the light itself.\n\n(See also: [darkness](../kt/darkness.md), [holy](../kt/holy.md), [righteous](../kt/righteous.md), [true](../kt/true.md))\n\n## Bible References: ##\n\n* [1 John 01:5-7](en/tn/1jn/help/01/05)\n* [1 John 02:7-8](en/tn/1jn/help/02/07)\n* [2 Corinthians 04:5-6](en/tn/2co/help/04/05)\n* [Acts 26:15-18](en/tn/act/help/26/15)\n* [Isaiah 02:5-6](en/tn/isa/help/02/05)\n* [John 01:4-5](en/tn/jhn/help/01/04)\n* [Matthew 05:15-16](en/tn/mat/help/05/15)\n* [Matthew 06:22-24](en/tn/mat/help/06/22)\n* [Nehemiah 09:12-13](en/tn/neh/help/09/12)\n* [Revelation 18:23-24](en/tn/rev/help/18/23)",

He also taught his followers to love others sacrificially.\n* When people love others with this kind of love, it involves actions that show that someone is thinking of what will cause the others to thrive. This kind of love especially includes forgiving others.\n* In the ULB, the word \"love\" refers to this kind of sacrificial love, unless a Translation Note indicates a different meaning.\n\n2. Another word in the New Testament refers to brotherly love, or love for a friend or family member.\n\n* This term refers to natural human love between friends or relatives.\n* It can also be used in such contexts as, \"They love to sit in the most important seats at a banquet.\" This means that they \"like very much\" or \"greatly desire\" to do that.\n\n3. The word \"love\" can also refer to romantic love between a man and a woman.\n\n4. In the figurative expression \"Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated,\" the term \"loved\" refers to God's choosing of Jacob to be in a covenant relationship with him. This could also be translated as \"chosen.\" Although Esau was also blessed by God, he wasn't given the privilege of being in the covenant. The term \"hated\" is used figuratively here to mean \"rejected\" or \"not chosen.\"\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* Unless indicated otherwise in a Translation Note, the word \"love\" in the ULB refers to the kind of sacrificial love that comes from God.\n* Some languages may have a special word for the kind of unselfish, sacrificial love that God has. Ways to translate this might include, \"devoted, faithful caring\" or \"care for unselfishly\" or \"love from God.\" Make sure that the word used to translate God's love can include giving up one's own interests to benefit others and loving others no matter what they do.\n* Sometimes the English word \"love\" describes the deep caring that people have for friends and family members. Some languages might translate this with a word or phrase that means, \"like very much\" or \"care for\" or \"have strong affection for.\"\n* In contexts where the word \"love\" is used to express a strong preference for something, this could be translated by \"strongly prefer\" or \"like very much\" or \"greatly desire.\"\n* Some languages may also have a separate word that refers to romantic or sexual love between a husband and wife.\n* Many languages must express \"love\" as an action. So for example, they might translate \"love is patient, love is kind\" as, \"when a person loves someone, he is patient with him and kind to him.\"\n\n(See also: [covenant](../kt/covenant.md), [death](../kt/death.md), [sacrifice](../other/sacrifice.md), [save](../kt/save.md), [sin](../kt/sin.md))\n\n## Bible References: ##\n\n* [1 Corinthians 13:4-7](en/tn/1co/help/13/04)\n* [1 John 03:1-3](en/tn/1jn/help/03/01)\n* [1 Thessalonians 04:9-12](en/tn/1th/help/04/09)\n* [Galatians 05:22-24](en/tn/gal/help/05/22)\n* [Genesis 29:15-18](en/tn/gen/help/29/15)\n* [Isaiah 56:6-7](en/tn/isa/help/56/06)\n* [Jeremiah 02:1-3](en/tn/jer/help/02/01)\n* [John 03:16-18](en/tn/jhn/help/03/16)\n* [Matthew 10:37-39](en/tn/mat/help/10/37)\n* [Nehemiah 09:32-34](en/tn/neh/help/09/32)\n* [Philippians 01:9-11](en/tn/php/help/01/09)\n* [Song of Solomon 01:1-4](en/tn/sng/help/01/01)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories: ##\n\n* __[27:02](en/tn/obs/help/27/02)__ The law expert replied that God's law says, \"__Love__  the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind.

This should be translated using the term that the language uses to refer to this hand. \n* Regarding figurative uses, if an expression that includes the term \"right hand\" does not have the same meaning in the project language, then consider whether that language has a different expression with the same meaning.\n* The expression \"at the right hand of\" could be translated as \"on the right side of\" or \"in the place of honor beside\" or \"in the position of strength\" or \"ready to help.\"\n* Ways to translate \"with his right hand\" could include \"with authority\" or \"using power\" or \"with his amazing strength.\"\n* The figurative expression \"his right hand and his mighty arm\" uses two ways of emphasizing God's power and great strength. One way to translate this expression could be \"his amazing strength and mighty power.\" (See: [parallelism](en/ta-vol1/translate/man/figs-parallelism))\n* The expression \"their right hand is falsehood\" could be translated as, \"even the most honorable thing about them is corrupted by lies\" or \"their place of honor is corrupted by deception\" or \"they use lies to make themselves powerful.\" \n* In Psalm 109.6, God calls for an accuser to be at the \"right hand\" of a wicked leader sent to punish his rebellious people. This could be translated as, \"appoint an accuser to have the place of honor beside that wicked leader\" or \"appoint an accuser to help that wicked leader punish them.\"\n\n(See also: [accuse](../other/accuse.md), [evil](../kt/evil.md), [honor](../other/honor.md), [mighty](../other/mighty.md), [punish](../other/punish.md), [rebel](../other/rebel.md))\n\n## Bible References: ##\n\n* [Acts 02:32-33](en/tn/act/help/02/32)\n* [Colossians 03:1-4](en/tn/col/help/03/01)\n* [Galatians 02:9-10](en/tn/gal/help/02/09)\n* [Genesis 48:14-16](en/tn/gen/help/48/14)\n* [Hebrews 10:11-14](en/tn/heb/help/10/11)\n* [Lamentations 02:3-4](en/tn/lam/help/02/03)\n* [Matthew 25:31-33](en/tn/mat/help/25/31)\n* [Matthew 26:62-64](en/tn/mat/help/26/62)\n* [Psalms 044:3-4](en/tn/psa/help/44/03)\n* [Revelation 02:1-2](en/tn/rev/help/02/01)",

The surrounding text usually makes it clear whether a servant or a slave is being referred to.\n\n* In Bible times, there was less of a difference between a servant and a slave than there is today. Both servants and slaves were an important part of their master's household and many were treated almost like members of the family. Sometimes a servant would choose to become a lifetime servant to his master.\n* A slave is a kind of servant who is the property of the person he works for. The person who buys a slave is called his \"owner\" or \"master.\" Some masters treat their slaves very cruelly, while other masters treat their slaves very well, like a servant who is a valued member of the household.\n* In ancient times, some people willingly became slaves to a person they owed money to in order to pay off their debt to that person. \n* In the Bible, the phrase \"I am your servant\" was used as a sign of respect and service to a person of higher rank, such as a king. It does not mean that the person speaking was an actual servant.\n* In the Old Testament, God's prophets and other people who worshiped God are often referred to as his \"servants.\"\n* In the New Testament, people who obey God through faith in Christ are often called his \"servants.\"\n* Christians are also called \"slaves to righteousness,\" which is a metaphor that compares the commitment to obey God to a slave's commitment to obeying his master.

For example, \"Azariah, son of Zadok\" and  \"Azariah, son of Nathan\" in 1 Kings 4, and \"Azariah, son of Amaziah in 2 Kings 15 are three different men.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* It may be necessary to use different terms for each of the various uses of \"son\" in order to  communicate them accurately.\n* When translating the term \"Son of God,\" however, your language's common term for \"son\" should be used.\n* When used to refer to a descendant who is more distant than a direct son, a term such as \"descendant\" could be used. For example, rather than referring to Jesus as the \"son of David\" it may be more clear to say \"descendant of David,\" and in genealogies where \"son\" refers to a distant male descendant, the most natural term should be used.\n* Sometimes \"sons\" can be translated as \"children,\" when both males and females are being referred to. For example, \"sons of God\" could be translated as \"children of God\" since this expression also includes girls and women.\n* The figurative expression \"son of\" could also be translated as \"someone who has the characteristics of\" or \"someone who is like\" or \"someone who has\" or \"someone who acts like.\"\n\n(See also: [Azariah](../other/azariah.md), [descendant](../other/descendant.md), [ancestor](../other/father.md), [firstborn](../kt/firstborn.md), [Son of God](../kt/sonofgod.md), [sons of God](../kt/sonsofgod.md))\n\n## Bible References: ##\n\n* [1 Chronicles 18:14-17](en/tn/1ch/help/18/14)\n* [1 Kings 13:1-3](en/tn/1ki/help/13/01)\n* [1 Thessalonians 05:4-7](en/tn/1th/help/05/04)\n* [Galatians 04:6-7](en/tn/gal/help/04/06)\n* [Hosea 11:1-2](en/tn/hos/help/11/01)\n* [Isaiah 09:6-7](en/tn/isa/help/09/06)\n* [Matthew 03:16-17](en/tn/mat/help/03/16)\n* [Matthew 05:9-10](en/tn/mat/help/05/09)\n* [Matthew 08:11-13](en/tn/mat/help/08/11)\n* [Nehemiah 10:28-29](en/tn/neh/help/10/28)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories: ##\n\n* __[04:08](en/tn/obs/help/04/08)__ God spoke to Abram and promised again that he would have a __son__  and as many descendants as the stars in the sky.\n* __[04:09](en/tn/obs/help/04/09)__ God said, \"I will give you a __son__  from your own body.\"\n* __[05:05](en/tn/obs/help/05/05)__ About a year later, when Abraham was 100 years old and Sarah was 90, Sarah gave birth to Abraham's __son__.\n* __[05:08](en/tn/obs/help/05/08)__ When they reached the place of sacrifice, Abraham tied up his __son__  Isaac and laid him on an altar.

      "file": "# Yahweh #\n\n## Facts: ##\n\nThe term \"Yahweh\" is God's personal name that he revealed when he spoke to Moses at the burning bush. \n\n* The name \"Yahweh\" comes from the word that means, \"to be\" or \"to exist.\"\n* Possible meanings of \"Yahweh\" include, \"he is\" or \"I am\" or \"the one who causes to be.\"\n* This name reveals that God has always lived and will continue to live forever. It also means that he is always present.\n* Following tradition, many Bible versions use the term \"LORD\" or \"the LORD\" to represent \"Yahweh.\" This tradition resulted from the fact that historically, the Jewish people became afraid of mispronouncing Yahweh's name and started saying \"Lord\" every time the term \"Yahweh\" appeared in the text. Modern Bibles write \"LORD\" with all capital letters to show respect for God's personal name and to distinguish it from \"Lord\" which is a different Hebrew word.\n* The ULB and UDB texts always translates this term as, \"Yahweh,\" as it literally occurs in the Hebrew text of the Old Testament.\n* The term \"Yahweh\" does not ever occur in the original text of the New Testament; only the Greek term for \"Lord\" is used, even in quotes from the Old Testament.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* \"Yahweh\" could be translated by a word or phrase that means \"I am\" or \"living one\" or \"the one who is\" or \"he who is alive.\"\n* This term could also be written in a way that is similar to how \"Yahweh\" is spelled.\n* Some church denominations prefer not to use the term \"Yahweh\" and instead use the traditional rendering, \"LORD.\" An important consideration is that this may be confusing when read aloud because it will sound the same as the title \"Lord.\" Some languages may have an affix or other grammatical marker that could be added to distinguish \"LORD\" as a name (Yahweh) from \"Lord\" as a title.\n\n(Translation suggestions: [How to Translate Names](en/ta-vol1/translate/man/translate-names))\n\n(See also: [God](../kt/god.md), [lord](../kt/lord.md), [Lord](../kt/lordgod.md), [Moses](../other/moses.md), [reveal](../kt/reveal.md))\n\n## Bible References: ##\n\n* [1 Kings 21:19-20](en/tn/1ki/help/21/19)\n* [1 Samuel 16:6-7](en/tn/1sa/help/16/06)\n* [Daniel 09:3-4](en/tn/dan/help/09/03)\n* [Ezekiel 17:24](en/tn/ezk/help/17/24)\n* [Genesis 02:4-6](en/tn/gen/help/02/04)\n* [Genesis 04:3-5](en/tn/gen/help/04/03)\n* [Genesis 28:12-13](en/tn/gen/help/28/12)\n* [Hosea 11:12](en/tn/hos/help/11/12)\n* [Isaiah 10:3-4](en/tn/isa/help/10/03)\n* [Isaiah 38:7-8](en/tn/isa/help/38/07)\n* [Job 12:9-10](en/tn/job/help/12/09)\n* [Joshua 01:8-9](en/tn/jos/help/01/08)\n* [Lamentations 01:4-5](en/tn/lam/help/01/04)\n* [Leviticus 25:35-38](en/tn/lev/help/25/35)\n* [Malachi 03:4-5](en/tn/mal/help/03/04)\n* [Micah 02:3-5](en/tn/mic/help/02/03)\n* [Numbers 08:9-11](en/tn/num/help/08/09)\n* [Psalm 124:1-3](en/tn/psa/help/124/01)\n* [Ruth 01:19-21](en/tn/rut/help/01/19)\n* [Zechariah 14:5](en/tn/zec/help/14/05)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories: ##\n\n* __[09:14](en/tn/obs/help/09/14)__ God said, \"I AM WHO I AM.
