===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The story of King Manasseh's reign continues.

  * **It is in Jerusalem that my name will be forever.** - The name is a metonym for the person. AT: "Jerusalem is where I will forever make known who I am." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He built altars for all the stars of heaven in the two courtyards of the house of Yahweh** - It is implied that he built these altars so people could make sacrifices and worship the stars. AT: "He built altars in the two courtyards of the house of Yahweh so that the people could worship the stars and offer them sacrifices" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He put his son into the fire** - You may need to make explicit why he put his son in the fire and what happened after he did so. AT: "He burned his son to death as an offering to his gods." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **consulted** - "asked for information from"
  * **evil in the sight of Yahweh** - The nominal adjective "evil" can be translated as a relative clause "things that ... evil." Here Yahweh's "sight" refers to how he judges or decides on the value of something. Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:03:01|3:2]]. AT: "He did things that Yahweh said were evil" or "He did the things that Yahweh considers evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
