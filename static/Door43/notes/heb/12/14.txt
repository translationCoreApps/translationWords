====== Hebrews 12:14-17 ======

<usfm>
\v 14 Try to live peacefully with all people. Seek to be holy, since no one will see the Lord if he is not holy.
\v 15 Beware that none of you stops \add trusting in\add* God, \add who has done kind things for us that we did not deserve\add* \f + \ft Or: Beware that you have never \add experienced\add* God kindly \add saving you\add* \f*. Be on guard lest any of you \add act evilly towards others\add*, because that will \add grow like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a root \add grows into a big plant\add*, and the result \add of your\add* doing that will be that many believers will sin and become unacceptable to God.
\v 16 Do not let anyone be immoral, or be irreligious as Esau was. He exchanged the rights he had as a firstborn son for only one meal.
\v 17 You know that after he did that, he wanted to receive \add what his father would promise to give him if\add* he blessed him. But \add his father\add* refused \add to do what he requested\add*. And Esau found no way to change what he had done, even though he sought tearfully to do that.

\v 14 Try to live peacefully with all people. Do your best to be holy, since no one will see the Lord if he is not holy.
\v 15 Beware that none of you stops trusting in God, who has done kind things for us that we did not deserve. Be on guard so that none of you act in an evil way toward others, because that will grow like a root grows into a big plant, leading many believers to sin.
\v 16 Do not let anyone be immoral or disobey God like Esau. He exchanged the rights he had as a firstborn son for only one meal.
\v 17 Esau later wanted to get back his birth rights and all that his father Isaac's blessing would give him. But Isaac refused to do what Esau requested. So Esau found no way to get back his birth rights and blessing, even though he sought it tearfully.

<usfm>
\p
\v 14 Pursue peace with everyone, and also the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.
\v 15 Be careful so that no one lacks God's grace, and that no root of bitterness grows up to cause trouble, so that many do not become polluted by it.
\v 16 Be careful that there be no sexually immoral or ungodly person such as Esau, who for one meal sold his own birthright.
\v 17 For you know that afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, because he found no opportunity for repentance, even though he sought it with tears.
