== Metaphor ==
David uses many metaphors to express his trust in God's protection: "my rock, my fortress, my shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge." He used other metaphors to express the hopelessness:  "the waves of death surrounded me," "the rushing waters of worthlessness overwhelmed me," "the cords of sheol surrounded me;" "the snares of death trapped me," and  "the surging water." He also used metaphors for the victory God gave him: "I can run over a barricade" and "by my God I can leap over a wall." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])
