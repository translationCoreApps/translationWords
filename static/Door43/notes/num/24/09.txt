===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Balaam finishes the prophecy under the control of the Spirit of God.

  * **He crouches down like a lion, like a lioness** - In this simile, Balaam compares the Israelites to both male and female lions. This means they are dangerous and always ready to attack. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Who dares disturb him?** - Balaam uses a question to warn all the people to not provoke the Israelites. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "No one dares to disturb him!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **May everyone who blesses him be blessed; may everyone who curses him be cursed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "May God bless those who bless the Israelites; may he curse those who curse the Israelites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
