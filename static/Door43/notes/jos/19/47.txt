\v 47 When the territory of the tribe of Dan was lost to them, Dan attacked Leshem, fought against it, and captured it. They killed everyone with the sword, took possession of it, and settled in it. They renamed Leshem, calling it Dan after their ancestor.
\v 48 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Dan, and it was given to their clansâ€”the cities, including their villages.
