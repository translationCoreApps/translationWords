\v 35 On that same day, when the sun was setting, Jesus said to his disciples, "Let us cross over to the other side of the lake."
\v 36 Jesus was already in the boat, so they left the crowd of people and sailed away. Other people also went along with them in their boats.
\v 37 A strong wind came up and the waves started coming into the boat! The boat was soon nearly full of water!

\v 35 On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us go over to the other side."
\v 36 So they left the crowd, taking Jesus with them, just as he was, in the boat. There were other boats going along with him. 
\v 37 Just then a violent windstorm arose and the waves were breaking into the boat so that the boat was almost full of water.
