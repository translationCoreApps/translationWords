===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This begins a new theme: Asaph is proclaiming God's mighty deeds in the history of his people.

  * **God has been my king from ancient times** - Possible meanings are 1) Asaph is speaking as Israel's representative, "God has been our king since we Israelites first became a nation" or 2) "God, my king, was alive even in ancient times."
  * **bringing salvation** - "saving people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **You divided ... in the waters** - Asaph is probably speaking of the time God brought Israel out of Egypt, divided the Sea of Reeds, led Israel through it on dry land, then drowned Pharaoh's army.
  * **You divided the sea by your strength** - Asaph is speaking of God as if God had a physical body. "You are so strong you were able to make dry land in the middle of the sea."
  * **the sea** - "the great water"
  * **you smashed the heads of the sea monsters in the waters** - Asaph is probably speaking of Pharaoh and his army as if they were sea monsters. If possible, translate these words literally. AT: "when you killed Pharaoh's army, it was as if you smashed the heads of sea monsters in the waters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
