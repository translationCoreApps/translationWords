====== Romans 03:3-4 ======

<usfm>
\v 3 Many \add Jews did not obey God as they promised that they would. So someone might ask\add*, "Does their not being faithful mean that God will not \add bless us Jews\add* as he promised \add that he would\add*?"
\v 4 \add I would reply\add*, "No, it certainly does not mean that! God always does \add what he has promised\add*, even though \add people do not\add*. All those who accuse God \add of not keeping his promises to us Jews\add* are very mistaken." \add What King David wrote about God's justly saying that he would punish him for his sins is also true of those who accuse God of not keeping his promises. What he said to God was\add*, "So everyone must acknowledge that what you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* have said \add about them\add* \f + \ft Or: \add their sin\add* \f* is true, and you will always win the case when you are accused \f + \ft Or:when \add people\add* accuse you \f*."

\v 3 Does the Jews not being faithful mean that God will not bless as he promised that he would?
\v 4 I No, it certainly does not mean that! God always does what he has promised, even though people do not. All those who accuse God of not keeping his promises to us Jews are very mistaken. King David wrote about this:
"So everyone must acknowledge that what you have said about them is true, and that you will always win the case when anyone accuses you of doing wrong."

\v 3 For what if some Jews were without faith? Will their unbelief make God's faithfulness invalid?
\v 4 May it never be. Instead, let God be found to be true, even though every man is a liar. As it has been written,
\q "That you might be shown to be righteous in your words,
\q and might prevail when you come into judgment."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For what if some Jews were without faith? Will their unbelief make God's faithfulness invalid?** - Paul uses these questions to make people think. AT: "Some Jews have not been faithful to God. Should we conclude from this that God will not fulfill his promise?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **May it never be** - This expression strongly denies that this could happen. You may have an expression in your language that you could use here. "That is not possible!" or "Certainly not!"
  * **Instead** - "We should say this instead"
  * **let God be found to be true** - God will always be true and will keep his promises. AT: "God always does what he has promised" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **even though every man is a liar** - Paul exaggerates here to add emphasis that God is always true to his promises. AT: "even if every man were a liar" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]) 
  * **As it has been written** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "The Scriptures themselves agree with what I am saying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **That you might be shown to be righteous in your words, and might prevail when you come into judgment** - These two phrases have very similar meanings. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "Everyone must acknowledge that what you say is true, and you will always win your case when anyone accuses you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
