==Impossible actions ==
Elisha caused an iron ax head to float. He fooled the whole army of Aram that was sent to arrest him.

Elisha told the king of Israel that there would be plenty of food the next day, but the king's counselor said it was impossible.

== Rhetorical question == 
The king's counselor expressed his unbelief in Elisha's prophecy of plenty of food: "See, even if Yahweh should make windows in heaven, can this thing happen?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], [[:en:obe:kt:unbeliever]] and [[:en:obe:kt:heaven]])
