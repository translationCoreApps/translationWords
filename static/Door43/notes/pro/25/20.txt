  * [[:en:obe:other:heart]]
===== translationNotes: =====

  * **carbonate of soda** - This is a kind of mineral that hisses and bubbles violently when it comes into contact with acids like vinegar. Many translations translate this phrase as "a wound."
  * **sings songs** - You may need to make explicit what kind of songs the singer sings. AT: "sings happy songs" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a heavy heart** - The heart is a synecdoche for the whole person. AT: "a sad person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
