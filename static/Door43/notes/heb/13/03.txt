\v 3 Remember \add to help\add* those who are in prison \add because they are Christians\add*, as though you were in prison with them. Remember those who are being mistreated \f + \ft Or:whom people are mistreating \f* \add because they are believers. As you do that\add*, consider that you are also alive \f + \ft metonymy \f*, \add and you could suffer as they do\add*.


\p
\v 4 You must respect\f + \ft Or: keep sacred \f* the marriage relationship in every way, and you must keep sexual relations \f + \ft euphemism \f* pure, because God will surely condemn those who act immorally and those who act adulterously.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Remember to help those who are in prison because they are believers, as though you were in prison with them and were suffering physically as they are doing.


\p
\v 4 Men and women who are married to each other must respect each other, and they must be faithful to each other. God will surely condemn those who act immorally or adulterously.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Remember prisoners, as if you were bound with them. Remember those who are mistreated, as if you also were them in the body.
\v 4 Let marriage be respected by everyone. Let the marriage bed be pure, for God will judge the sexually immoral people and adulterers.
</usfm>
