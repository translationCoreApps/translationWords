===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here Luke tells background information about a prophecy in Antioch. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main story-line.
  * **came down from Jerusalem to Antioch** - Jerusalem was higher in elevation than Antioch, so it was normal for Israelites to speak of going up to Jerusalem or going down from it.
  * **Agabus by name** - "whose name was Agabus" (UDB)
  * **indicated by the Spirit** - "the Holy Spirit enabled him to prophesy" (UDB)
  * **a great famine would occur** - "a great shortage of food would happen"
  * **over all the world** - This was an exaggeration refering to the Roman Empire. AT: "throughout the Roman Empire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **in the days of Claudius** - Luke's audience would know that Claudius was the emperor of Rome at that time. AT: "when Claudius was the Roman emperor" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
