== David's move ==
David was afraid Saul would someday catch him and kill him so he moved to the Philistine city of Gath. This was a type of exile David created for himself out of fear. It was caused by his lack of trust in God. This is the same reason his descendants would come to be exiled. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])
