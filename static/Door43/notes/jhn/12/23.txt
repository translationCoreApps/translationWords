\v 23 Then, \add to show them that he must die in order to give eternal life to non-Jews like those Greeks\add*, Jesus replied to them, "It is time for \add God\add* to honor me, the one who came from heaven. \add That will happen when I die\add*.
\v 24 Listen to this carefully: \add My life is like a seed\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. If \add someone\add* does not plant a kernel of grain in the ground, it does not change. It remains only one \add seed\add*. But if it changes \add after it is planted in the ground, it will grow and\add* produce many seeds.

\v 23 Jesus answered Philip and Andrew, "It is time for God to show the people everything that I, the Son of Man, have done and to tell them all that I have said.
\v 24 I am telling you the truth: unless a seed of wheat is planted in the earth and dies, it remains only one seed; but after it dies in the ground, then it will grow and produce a harvest of many seeds.

\v 23 Jesus answered them and said, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
\v 24 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone; but if it dies, it will bear much fruit.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus begins to respond to Philip and Andrew.

  * **The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified** - Jesus implies that it is now the right time for God to honor the Son of Man through his upcoming suffering, death and resurrection. AT: "God will soon honor me when I die and rise again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Truly, truly, I say to you** - Translate this the way your language emphasizes that what follows is important and true. See how you translated "Truly, truly" in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:01:49|01:51]].
  * **unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies ... it will bear much fruit** - Here "a grain of wheat" or "seed" is a metaphor for Jesus' death, burial and resurrection. Just as a seed is planted and grows again into a plant that will bear much fruit, so will many people trust in Jesus after he is killed, buried, and raised back to life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
