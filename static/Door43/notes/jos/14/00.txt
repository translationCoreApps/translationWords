====== Joshua 14 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Drive them out ==
The Israelites were to completely drive out the Canaanites. If they did not drive them out completely, the Canaanites would cause the Israelites to worship other gods. It was sinful to allow the Canaanites to remain in the land. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])
