\v 6 Then Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, "In the evening you will know that it is Yahweh who has brought you out from the land of Egypt.
\v 7 In the morning you will see Yahweh's glory, for he hears your complaining against him. Who are we for you to complain against us?"
\v 8 Moses also said, "You will know this when Yahweh gives you meat in the evening and bread in the morning to the fullâ€”for he has heard the complaints that you speak against him. Who are Aaron and I? Your complaints are not against us; they are against Yahweh."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Who are we for you to complain against us?** - Moses and Aaron used this question to show the people that it was foolish to complain against them. AT: "We are not powerful enough for you to complain against us." or "It is foolish to complain against us, because we cannot do what you want."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **bread** - Moses speaks of the food that God will send as if it were bread. The Israelites would eat this food every day, just as they had eaten bread every day before this. See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:16:04|16:4]]. AT: "food" or "food like bread" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Who are Aaron and I?** - Moses used this question to show the people that he and Aaron did not have the power to give them what they wanted. AT: "Aaron and I cannot give you what you want." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Your complaints are not against us; they are against Yahweh** - The people were complaining against Moses and Aaron, who were Yahweh's servants. So by complaining against them, the people were really complaining against Yahweh. AT: Your complaints are not really against us; they are against Yahweh, because we are his servants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
