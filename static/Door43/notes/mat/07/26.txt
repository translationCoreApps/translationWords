\v 26 On the other hand, anyone who hears what I say but does not obey what I say will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
\v 27 When the rain fell and the river flooded, and the winds blew and beat against that house, it crashed down and broke completely apart, \add because it was built on the sand. So it is important for you to obey what I teach you\add*."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This is the end of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, which began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:3]]. 

  * **like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand** - Jesus continues the simile from the previous verse. He compares those who do not obey his words to foolish house-builders. Only a fool would build a house on a sandy place where rain, floods, and wind can sweep the sand away. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **fell** - Use the general word in your language that describes what happens when a house falls down.
  * **and its destruction was complete** - The rain, floods, and wind completely destroyed the house.
