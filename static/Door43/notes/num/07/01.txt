\v 1 On the day that Moses completed the tabernacle, he anointed it and set it apart to Yahweh, together with all of its furnishings. He did the same for the altar and all its utensils. He anointed them and set them apart to Yahweh.
\v 2 On that day, the leaders of Israel, the heads of their ancestor's families, offered sacrifices. These men were leading the tribes. They had overseen the counting of the men in the census.
\v 3 They brought their offerings before Yahweh. They brought six covered carts and twelve oxen. They brought one cart for every two leaders, and each leader brought one ox. They presented these things in front of the tabernacle.

  * **had overseen the counting of the men** - The abstract noun "counting" can be stated as a verb. AT: "had helped Aaron and Moses to count the men" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **They brought their offerings before Yahweh ... They presented these things in front of the tabernacle** - This means that they gave their offerings to Yahweh and brought them to the tabernacle.
