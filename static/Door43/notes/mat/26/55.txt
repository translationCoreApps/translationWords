\v 55 At that time Jesus said to the crowd, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to seize me like a robber? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me.
\v 56 But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Have you come out with swords and clubs to seize me like a robber?** - Jesus is using this question to point out the wrong actions of those arresting him. AT: "You know that I am not a robber, so it is wrong for you to come out to me bringing swords and clubs" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **clubs** - large pieces of hard wood for hitting people
  * **in the temple** - It is implied that Jesus was not in the actual temple. He was in the courtyard around the temple. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I would fulfill all that the prophets wrote in the scriptures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **left him** - If your language has a word that means they left him when they should have stayed with him, use it here.
