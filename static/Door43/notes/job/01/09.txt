\v 10 You have always \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* protected \f + \ft metaphor \f* him and his family and everything that he owns. You have made him very prosperous\f + \ft Or: rich \f*. He has very many livestock all over this land.
\v 11 But if you take away \f + \ft metonymy \f* everything that he has, he will curse you openly. [IDI]"
\p
\v 12 Yahweh replied to Satan, "All right\f + \ft Or: Okay \f*, I will permit you to take away everything that he has. But do not harm him."
\p Then Satan left, \add and he prepared to cause many disastrous things to happen to Job\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Satan replied to Yahweh, "What you say is true, but Job honors you only because of what you have done for him.
\v 10 You have always protected him, his family, and everything he owns. You make him succeed in whatever work he tries to do, and he has very much livestock all over his land.
\v 11 But if you attacked what he owns and took it away, he would curse you in front of everyone."
\p
\v 12 Yahweh replied to Satan, "So this is what you want me to do! All right, I will permit you to take away everything that he has. But do not harm him in his own body."
\p Satan agreed and then left Yahweh in order to plan how he would attack Job.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Then Satan answered Yahweh and said, "Does Job fear God without reason?
\v 10 Have you not put a barrier around him, around his house, and around all that is his from every side? You have blessed the deeds of his hands, and his cattle have burst forth in the land.
\v 11 But now stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, and see if he does not curse you to your face."
\v 12 Yahweh said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not stretch out your hand." Then Satan went away from the presence of Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Does Job fear God without reason?** - "Does Job respect God for no reason?" Satan responds to God by presenting and answering his own question. He says that Job obeys God only because God blesses him. AT: "Job has a reason for obeying God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Have you not put a barrier around him, around his house, and around all that is his from every side** - Satan states the facts to support his argument. AT: "You have protected him, his family and everything he owns." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **put a barrier around him, around his house, and around all that is his from every side** - Just as a barrier such as a wall or a hedge surrounds and protects one's land, God has surrounded Job with his protection. AT: "protected him and his house and all that is his" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the deeds of his hands** - "everything that he does"
  * **his cattle have burst forth in the land** - "he has more and more livestock in the land"
  * **But now stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, and see if he does not curse you to your face** - Satan means that if God attacks Job, he will see how Job responds. AT: "But now, if you stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, you will see that he will curse you to your face"
  * **But now stretch out your hand** - Here "hand" refers to God's power to act. "But now use your power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **touch all that he has** - Here "touch" represents the action of harming or destroying. AT: "attack all that he has" or "destroy all that he has" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to your face** - This refers to a time when God is paying attention. AT: "in your hearing" 
  * **Behold** - "Look" or "Pay attention to all that I am about to tell you"
  * **all that he has is in your hand** - Here "hand" represents someone's power to control something. AT: "you have power over all that he has." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **against him himself** - "against his body." AT: "do not harm him physically" or "do not harm his body"
  * **went away from the presence of Yahweh** - "departed from Yahweh" or "left Yahweh"
