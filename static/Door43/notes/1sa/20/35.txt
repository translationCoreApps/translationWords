\v 36 He said to his young man, "Run and find the arrows that I shoot." As the young man ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **a young man was with him** - Here "him" refers to Jonathan.
  * **he shot an arrow beyond him** - "Jonathan shot an arrow beyond the young man"
  * **Is not the arrow beyond you?** - Jonathan uses this question to emphasize that the arrow is farther ahead of the young man. The uses of litotes also emphasizes this. The rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You should know that the arrow is beyond you" or "The arrow is far beyond you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
