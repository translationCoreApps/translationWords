===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 The Jews who were against Jesus had previously agreed with one another that they would take anyone who declared that Jesus was the Messiah and ban him from the synagogue.
\v 23 That is why his parents said, "Ask him, he is old enough to speak for himself."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 His parents said these things, because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed that if anyone would confess him to be the Christ, he would be thrown out of the synagogue.
\v 23 Because of this, his parents said, "He is an adult, ask him."

  * **they were afraid of the Jews** - Here "Jews" is a synecdoche for the "Jewish leaders" who opposed Jesus. AT: "they were afraid of what the Jewish leaders might do to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **afraid** - This refers to the unpleasant feeling a person has when there is a threat of harm to oneself or others.
