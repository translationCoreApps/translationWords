====== Leviticus 18:26-28 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 You must all obey my laws and decrees. That includes you people who were born here and the foreigners who live among you.
\v 27 All those detestable things were done by the people who lived in this land before you came here, and they caused the land to become defiled.
\v 28 So if you defile the land, I will get rid of \f + \ft metaphor \f* you like I got rid of the people of those nations that were here before you came.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 But you must all obey my laws and decrees. This includes both you people who were born here and the foreigners who live among you.
\v 27 As for all those detestable things, before you came, the people who lived in this land did them, and they defiled the land.
\v 28 So if you also defile the land, I will get rid of you as I got rid of the people of those nations that were here before you came.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 You, therefore, must keep my commandments and decrees, and you must not do any of these detestable things, neither the native-born Israelite nor the foreigner who lives among you.
\v 27 For this is the wickedness that the people in the land have committed, those who lived here before you, and now the land is defiled.
\v 28 Therefore be careful so that the land does not vomit you up also after you have defiled it, as it vomited out the people who were before you.

  * **any of these detestable things** - "any of these disgusting things"
  * **this is the wickedness** - This refers to "these detestable things."
  * **Therefore be careful** - "Therefore be careful to obey me"
  * **so that the land does not vomit you up ... as it vomited out the people** - Yahweh forcibly removing the people from the land is spoken of as if the land were a person who vomited the people out. See how you translated this metaphor in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:18:24|18:25]]. AT: "so that I do forcibly remove you from the land ... as I forcibly removed the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
