\q2 and insects will fall into the spider's web.
\q1
\v 6 You cannot hide the evil deeds that you have done.
\q1 You are constantly acting violently.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel about the evil they do using the metaphors of poisonous snakes and spider's webs.

  * **They hatch eggs of a poisonous snake** - Eggs of a poisonous snake hatch into more dangerous snakes. "Poisonous snakes" represents evil the people do that harms more and more. AT: "They make evil that spreads out to make more evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **weave a spider's web** - This represents the deeds of the people that are useless. AT: "produce things and activities that are useless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Whoever eats of their eggs dies, and if an egg is crushed, it hatches into a poisonous snake** - Eating a poisonous egg will kill the one that eats it and represents self-destruction. Breaking the egg allows the young poisonous snake to hatch and represents spreading destruction. AT: "The activities they do will destroy them and will spread destruction to others" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **if an egg is crushed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "if someone crushes an egg" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Their webs cannot be used for garments, nor can they cover themselves with their works** - This means their sinful deeds cannot be covered and hidden, just as a web cannot serve as clothing and cover someone. AT: "Their evil deeds will be exposed as useless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Their webs cannot be used for garments** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "They cannot clothe themselves with their webs" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **deeds of violence are in their hands** - "Hands" represents the ability and power to do these things and therefore their responsibility. AT: "they are fully responsible for the violence they do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
