<usfm>
\v 8 How blessed are your wives, and how blessed are your servants who constantly stand before you, because they hear your wisdom.
\f + \ft Some versions read \fqa How blessed are your men. \fqb Important ancient translations, however, have  \fqa How blessed are your wives. \fqb Many think it is probable that \fqa women \fqb was misread as \fqa men \fqb , because the Hebrew words are very similar. \f*
\v 9 May Yahweh your God be praised, who has taken pleasure in you, who placed you on the throne of Israel. Because Yahweh loved Israel forever, he has made you king, for you to do justice and righteousness!"
