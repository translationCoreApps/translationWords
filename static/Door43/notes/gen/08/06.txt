  * **It came about ... the window of the ark which he had made** - The phrase "which he had made" tells about the window. Some languages may need to make this phrase a separate sentence: "Noah had made a window in the boat. It came about after forty days that he opened the window" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])
