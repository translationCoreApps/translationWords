\v 18 I will not stop causing them to experience wars and famines and diseases. And I will scatter them all around the world. In every country where I force them to be taken, I will cause them to be people whom others curse and be horrified about and mock.
\v 19 That will happen because they have refused to pay attention to my messages, messages that I gave to the prophets whom I sent to them. And you who have been exiled to Babylon have not paid attention to them, either." That is what Yahweh says.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 And I will pursue them with sword, famine, and plague and make them a horrible sight to all the kingdoms on earth—a horror, an object about curses and hissed words, and a shameful thing among all the nations where I scattered her.
\v 19 This is because they did not listen to my word—this is Yahweh's declaration—that I sent out to them through my servants the prophets. I repeatedly sent them, but you would not listen—this is Yahweh's declaration.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **a horror, an object about curses and hissed words, and a shameful thing** - These words all share similar meanings and describe how the people of other nations will react when they see what Yahweh has done to the people of Judah.
  * **curses and hissed words** - The words "hissed words" refer to a sound of strong disapproval that people make when they say bad things about others. The phrase has basically the same meaning as "curses." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **listen** - AT: "obey"
