===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Put crooked speech away from you and put corrupt talk far from you** - The writer speaks of lying or deceitful speech as if it were crooked and of a person not using this kind of language as if it were removing it far away from oneself. AT: "Do not lie and do not speak deceitfully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Let your eyes look straight ahead and fix your gaze straight before you** - Here the word "eyes" represents the person who is looking. The writer speaks of a person being committed to doing the right thing as if that person were constantly looking forward without turning his head to look in another direction. AT: "Always look straight ahead and fix your gaze straight before you" (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
