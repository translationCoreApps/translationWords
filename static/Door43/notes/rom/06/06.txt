===== translationNotes: =====

  * **our old man was crucified with him** - The "old man" is a metaphor that refers to the person before he believes in Jesus. Paul describes our old sinful person as dying on the cross with Jesus when we believe in Jesus. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "our sinful person died on the cross with Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **old man** - This means the person who once was, but who does not exist now.
  * **the body of sin** - This is a metonym that refers to the whole sinful person. AT: "our sinful nature" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **might be destroyed** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "might die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **we should no longer be enslaved to sin** - Paul compares the power sin has over a person to a master who controls a slave. A person without the Holy Spirit is not free to do what pleases God. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "we should no longer choose to do what is sinful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **He who has died is declared righteous in respect to sin** - Here "righteous" refers to God's ability to make people right with him. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "When God declares a person right with him, that person is no longer controlled by sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
