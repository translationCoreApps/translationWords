\v 31 When Yahweh saw that Jacob did not love Leah \add very much\add*, he enabled her to become pregnant. But Rachel was not able to become pregnant.
\v 32 Leah gave birth to a son, whom she named Reuben, which sounds like the Hebrew words that mean 'look, a son!' She said, "Yahweh has seen that I was miserable, and because of that he has given me a son. Now, surely my husband will love me for giving birth to a son for him."

\v 31 Yahweh saw that Leah was not loved, so he opened her womb, but Rachel was childless.
\v 32 Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben. For she said, "Because Yahweh has looked upon my affliction; surely now my husband will love me."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Leah was not loved** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Jacob did not love Leah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **not loved** - This is an exaggeration to emphasize that Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah. AT: "loved less than Rachel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **so he opened her womb** - God causing Leah to be able to become pregnant is spoken of as if God is opening her womb. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **was childless** - "was not able to become pregnant"
  * **Leah conceived and bore a son** - "Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son"
  * **she called his name Reuben** - Translators may also add a footnote that says: "The name Reuben means 'See, a son.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Yahweh has looked upon my affliction** - Leah was experiencing emotional pain because Jacob had rejected her. The abstract noun "affliction" can be stated as a verb. AT: "Yahweh saw that I was suffering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
