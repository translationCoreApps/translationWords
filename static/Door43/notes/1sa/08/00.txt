== The people want a king ==

When Samuel was old, he appointed his sons to be judges. They were corrupt and took bribes, so the people came and asked Samuel to appoint a king for them. Samuel asked God who gave them a king but warned them what a king will be like. Despite Samuel's warning that a king would oppress them, the people still wanted a king. This was sinful. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:appoint]], [[:en:obe:kt:oppress]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]]).
