====== 2 Timothy 03:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Just like Jannes and Jambres \add long ago\add* very much opposed Moses, so also some \add people\add* now oppose the true \add message. Those\add* people think only what is evil. God rejects them \add because they do not\add* believe \add what is true\add*.
\v 9 Nevertheless, they will not continue to succeed, because most \f + \ft hyperbole \f* people will understand clearly that such people are foolish, just like people also realized \add clearly that Jannes and Jambres were foolish\add*.

\v 8 In the same way that Jannes and Jambres tried to stop Moses, so do these men now try to stop people from obeying the truth. These men are ruined in how they think. They are frauds in matters of the faith.
\v 9 Nevertheless, they will not succeed very much in what they do, because most others will clearly see that these people understand nothing. It is just like how the people of Israel saw that Jannes and Jambres were foolish.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 In the same way that Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses. In this way these false teachers also stand against the truth. They are men destroyed in mind, unapproved regarding the faith.
\v 9 But they will not advance very far. For their foolishness will be obvious to all, just like that of those men.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul gives an example of two false teachers from the time of Moses and applies it to the way people will be. He encourages Timothy to follow Paul's example and stay in God's word.

  * **stand against the truth** - "oppose the gospel of Jesus"
  * **They are men destroyed in mind** - "They are no longer able to think rightly"
  * **unapproved regarding the faith** - They have been tested in how well they trust in Christ and obey him, and they have failed the test. AT: "without sincere faith" or "and they have proven that their faith is not genuine"
  * **they will not advance very far** - Paul uses an expression about physical movement to mean that the false teachers will not have much success among the believers. AT: "they will not have much success" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
