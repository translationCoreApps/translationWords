\v 4 But they were terrified and said among themselves, "See, the two kings could not stand before Jehu. So how can we stand?"
\v 5 Then the man who was in charge of the palace, and the man who was over the city, and the elders also, and they who raised the children, sent word back to Jehu, saying, "We are your servants. We will do everything that you command us. We will not make any man king. Do what is good in your eyes."
