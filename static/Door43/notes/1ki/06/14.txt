===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Solomon ... he built ... he covered ... he covered** - It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people helped Solomon do these things. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **interior** - "inside"
  * **cypress** - Cypress is a kind of wood that was used for building the temple. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
