<usfm>
\v 4 The wicked person is so proud
\q2 he never looks for God 
\q2 and if he did look for God, he would not find him.
\q2 He is too proud to even think about God. 
\q1
\v 5 But, looking at the life of the wicked man, 
\q2 it seems that everything he does is successful. 
\q2 He cannot even understand your commands, God, 
\q2 and then he mocks his enemies.

\q
\v 4 The wicked man has a raised face; he does not seek God.
\q He never thinks about God because he does not care at all about him.
\q
\v 5 He is secure at all times,
\q but your righteous decrees are too high for him;
\q he snorts at all his enemies.
