===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to tell the people of Israel Yahweh's words as if the Israelites are one person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **You will consume all the people groups** - "I command you to completely destroy all the people groups"
  * **your eye will not pity them** - This is a command. Moses speaks as if what the eye sees were the eye itself. AT: "do not allow what you see to cause you to pity them" or "do not pity them because you see that what you are doing is hurting them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **You will not worship** - "never worship"
  * **that will be a trap for you** - If the people worship other gods, they will be like an animal caught in a hunter's trap, and they will be unable to escape. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
