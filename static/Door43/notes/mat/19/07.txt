\v 7 The Pharisees then said to him, "If that is true, why did Moses command that \add a man who wanted to divorce\add* his wife should give her a paper \add stating his reason for\add* divorcing her, and then send her away?"
\v 8 He said to them, "It was because\add your ancestors\add* stubbornly \add wanted their own ways\add* that Moses allowed them to divorce their wives, \add and you are no different from them\add*. But when God first \f + \ft metonymy \f* created a man and a woman, \add he did not intend for them to separate\add*.
\v 9 I am telling you emphatically that \add because God considers that a marriage lasts until either the husband or the wife dies, he considers that\add* any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman is committing adultery, unless\add his first wife\add* has committed adultery."

\v 7 They said to him, "Why then did Moses command us to give a certificate of divorce and then to send her away?"
\v 8 He said to them, "For your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not that way.
\v 9 I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and the man who marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery."

  * **They said to him** - "The Pharisees said to Jesus"
  * **command us** - "command us Jews"
  * **certificate of divorce** - This is a document that legally ends the marriage.
  * **For your hardness of heart** - The phrase "hardness of heart" is an idiom that means "stubborn." AT: "Because you are stubborn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
