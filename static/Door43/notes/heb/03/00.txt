====== Hebrews 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 3:7-9,15, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Brothers ==

The author probably uses the term "brothers" to refer to fellow Israelites and fellow Christians. Extra care should be taken to make sure the reference is clear. It may be necessary to occasionally leave the referent vague.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Harden your hearts ==
This is a common metaphor used in Scripture. It indicates that a person who rejects Jesus will increasingly lack the spiritual discernment necessary to believe in him. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]] and [[:en:obe:kt:believe]])

== Rhetorical questions ==

The author uses rhetorical questions as a way to convince his readers.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Prophecy ==
Jesus literally fulfilled these prophecies about the Messiah but the prophecies themselves often contain poetic or metaphorical language. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:christ]], and [[:en:ta::vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
