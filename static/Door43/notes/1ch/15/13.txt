\v 13 You did not carry it the first time. That is why Yahweh our God broke out against us, for we did not seek him or obey his decree."
\v 14 So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves so they could bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 15 So the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commandedâ€”following the rules given by the word of Yahweh.
