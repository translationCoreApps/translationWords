\v 19 After Stephen died, many of the believers left Jerusalem and went to other places because they were suffering there in Jerusalem. Some of them went to Phoenicia, some went to the Island of Cyprus, and others went to Antioch, a city in Syria. In those places they were continually telling people the message about Jesus, but they told only other Jewish people.
\v 20 Some of the believers were men from the Island of Cyprus and Cyrene city in north Africa. They went to Antioch and were also telling non-Jewish people about the Lord Jesus.
\v 21 The Lord God was powerfully enabling those believers to preach effectively. As a result, very many non-Jewish people believed their message and trusted in the Lord.

\v 19 Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution that started with the death of Stephen were spread as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, but they told the message about Jesus only to Jews.
\v 20 But some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, came to Antioch and spoke also to Greeks, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.
\v 21 The hand of the Lord was with them; a great number believed and turned to the Lord.

AT: "the persecution that started with the death of Stephen scattered the believers, and they spread" or "the suffering that began after the Jewish leaders killed Stephen caused many of the believers to leave Jerusalem, and they spread" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **only to Jews** - The believers thought God's message was for the Jewish people, and not for the Gentiles.
