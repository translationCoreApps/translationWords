\v 4 Furthermore, no one honors himself \add by appointing himself to become a high priest\add*. Instead, God chose each man \add to become a high priest\add*, as he chose Aaron \add to be the first high priest\add*.
\v 5 Similarly, Christ also did not honor himself by appointing himself to become a high priest. Instead, God \add appointed him by\add* saying to \add him what he never said to any other priest, what the\add* Psalmist wrote in the Scriptures,
\q You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are my Son! Today I have declared that I am your Father!

\v 4 But no one can honor himself by deciding to become the high priest. Instead, God chose each man to become a high priest, as he chose Aaron to be the first high priest.
\v 5 Similarly, Christ also did not honor himself by becoming high priest. Instead, God the Father appointed him by saying to him what the Psalmist wrote in the scriptures:
\q "You are my son! Today I have declared that I am your father!"

\v 4 It is not for himself that anyone takes this honor. Instead, he is called by God, just as Aaron was.
\v 5 In the same way, neither did Christ honor himself by making himself high priest. Instead, the one speaking to him said,
\q "You are my Son;
\q today I have become your Father."
