===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh speaks a parable to Ezekiel about a cooking pot that represents Jerusalem. This parable continues through [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:24:14|24:14]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **this rebellious house** - This is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:04|2:5]]. AT: "this rebellious people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Gather pieces of food** - Here "food" refers specifically to meat. AT: "Place pieces of meat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the best of the flock** - Here the "flock" refers to sheep, not birds. 
  * **pile up the bones under it** - Some cultures add bones to a fire because they burn longer than wood. This refers to the bones that remained after the best bones were placed in the pot. AT: "place the rest of the bones under the pot to fuel the fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
