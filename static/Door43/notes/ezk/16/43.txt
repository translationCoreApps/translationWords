\v 43 Because you did not call to mind the days of your youth and have made me shake with anger because of all these things, therefore, behold! I myself will bring down on your own head the punishment for what you have doneâ€”this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration. Have you not added prostitution to all your other detestable practices?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem as if the city were his unfaithful wife. The city represents the people who live there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
 
  * **call to mind** - This idiom means to remember. AT: "remember" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **have made me shake with anger because of all these things** - Here "shake" refers to a physical response that a person has when he is extremely angry. As Jerusalem was doing these things, she did not think about what Yahweh had done when she was young.
  * **behold!** - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. 
  * **I myself will bring down on your own head the punishment for what you have done** - The idiom "bring ... on your own head" means that she will experience this punishment. See how you translated this idiom in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:11:19|11:21]]. AT: "I will cause you to suffer the punishment for your conduct" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
