  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to bless the tribes of Israel; the blessings are short poems. He continues to describe the tribe of Joseph, which he began to do in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:33:13|33:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **May his land be blessed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "May Yahweh bless his land." Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:33:13|33:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **with the precious things of the harvest of the sun** - "with the best crops that the sun causes to grow"
  * **with the precious things of the produce of the months** - "with the best crops that grow month to month"
