<usfm>
\v 4 Jesus \add knew that they refused to believe in him\add*. So he said to them, "\add It is certainly true that\add* people honor \add me and other\add* prophets \add in other places, but\add* not in our hometowns! Even our relatives and the people who live in our own houses do not honor us!"
\p
\v 5 \add So\add*, although he healed a few sick people there by touching them, he \add decided\add* not to perform many \add other\add* miracles \add in Nazareth\add* because the people there did not believe that he was the Messiah.
\v 6 He was amazed that they did not believe \add in him\add*.


\p Jesus \add and his disciples\add* went from town to town \add in that region\add* teaching \add the people\add*.

\p
\v 5 So, although he healed a few sick people there, he was not able to perform any other miracle.

\v 4 And Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his own relatives and in his own household."
\v 5 He was unable to do any mighty work, except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to them** - "to the crowd"
  * **A prophet is not without honor, except** - This sentence uses a double negative to create emphasis of the positive equivalent. AT: "A prophet is always honored, except" or "The only place a prophet is not honored is" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **to lay his hands on a few sick people** - "Laying on hands" refers to a prophet or teacher placing his hands on someone and imparting either healing or a blessing. In this case, Jesus is healing people.
