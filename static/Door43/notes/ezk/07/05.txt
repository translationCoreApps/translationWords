===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.

  * **Disaster! A unique disaster! Behold, it is coming.** - These exclamations are meant to make the passage very strong. AT: "Behold, a terrible disaster is coming, one that no one has ever experienced before."
  * **Behold** - The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. Alternate translations: "Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you."
  * **The end has woken up against you** - The judgment that is coming is treated as if it were an enemy waking up from sleep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **the mountains will no longer be joyful** - "the people on the mountains will not have any more joy." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
