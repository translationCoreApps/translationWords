====== Exodus 32 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The events of this chapter occur while Moses spoke with God and therefore happen at the same time as chapter 20-31.

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 32:18, which is an important quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Idolatry ==
The making of the golden calf was considered a form of idolatry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
