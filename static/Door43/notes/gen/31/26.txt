\v 26 Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you deceived me and carried away my daughters like prisoners of war?
\v 27 Why did you flee secretly and trick me and did not tell me? I would have sent you away with celebration and with songs, with tambourine and with harps.
\v 28 You did not allow me to kiss my grandsons and my daughters good bye. Now you have done foolishly.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **carried away my daughters like prisoners of war** - Laban speaks about Jacob taking his family with him back to the land of Canaan as if Jacob took them as prisoners after a battle and is forcing them to go with him.

  * **flee secretly** - "run away in secret"
  * **with celebration** - "with joy"
  * **with tambourine and with harps** - These instruments stand for music. AT: "and with music" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **tambourine** - a musical instrument with a head like a drum that can be hit and with pieces of metal around the side that sound when the instrument is shaken (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **to kiss my grandsons** - Here "grandsons" would include all grandchildren whether male or female. AT: "to kiss my grandchildren" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
