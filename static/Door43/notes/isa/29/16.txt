\q1
\v 16 You turn things upside down! Should the potter be considered like clay,
\q1 so that the thing that is made should say about him who made it, "He did not make me,"
\q1 or the thing formed say about him who formed it, "He does not understand"?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You turn things upside down** - This is an idiom that means to distort what is true. AT: "You make things opposite of the way they should be" or "You distort the truth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Should the potter be considered like clay, so that the thing that is made should say about him who made it ... "He does not understand"?** - Yahweh who created humans is spoken of as if he were a potter and humans were the clay. This metaphor emphasizes that it is foolish for humans to reject or criticize the one who created them. AT: "Should you consider me, your maker, to be like the clay rather than the potter? It is as if a potter created something, and that thing said about the potter, 'He did not make me,' or 'He does not understand.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Should the potter be considered like clay ... "He does not understand"?** - This question is used to scold the people of Jerusalem. AT: "Obviously, the potter should not be considered like clay ... 'He does not understand.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
