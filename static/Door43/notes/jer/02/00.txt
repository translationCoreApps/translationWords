====== Jeremiah 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:1-31, which is an extended quotation.

The prophecy revealed to Jeremiah is recorded in 2:1-3:5. Despite covering more than one chapter, this should be seen as one unit. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:reveal]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The people refuse to learn ==

The people worshiped other gods, particularly the fertility gods of Baal and Ashtoreth. Even when the nation was punished, the people did not learn. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]])


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==

Israel is compared to a female camel or a wild donkey for being unstable and lustful. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
