===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is the beginning of the list of Adam's descendants.

  * **in his own likeness** - This phrase means that God made mankind to be like him. This verse does not tell in what ways God made people to be like himself. God does not have a body, so it does not mean that people would look like God. AT: "to truly be like us." See how "after our likeness" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:26|1:26]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **when they were created** - This can be made active. AT: "when he created them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
