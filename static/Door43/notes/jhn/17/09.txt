\v 9 I am praying for them. I am not praying for those who belong to this world, those who continue to oppose you. I am praying for those whom you gave me because they belong to you.
\v 10 All I have belongs to you, and all you have is mine. They know who I am, and they sincerely tell the truth about who I am.
\v 11 I am not staying in the world any longer. However, they are staying in the world. I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them safe; keep them belonging to yourself by the same power that you gave to me so that they may be united together, just as we are.

\v 9 I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.
\v 10 Everything that is mine is yours, and yours is mine, and I am glorified in them.
\v 11 I am no longer in the world, but these people are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name that you have given me so that they will be one, just as we are one.
