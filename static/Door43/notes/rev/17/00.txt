====== Revelation 17 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is a continuation of the previous chapter. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Prostitute ==
The Jews were often pictured as adulterous people and occasionally as prostitutes. This does not mean this is the reference here. The context may favor identifying the prostitute as Satan, but the translator should allow this illustration to be vague. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_apocalypticwriting]])

== Seven hills ==
Jerusalem was said to sit atop seven hills. This is possibly a reference to the city of Jerusalem. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ==

==Metaphors ==
John uses many different metaphors in this chapter. He gives some explanation of their meaning, but allows them to remain relatively unclear. The translator should attempt to do the same. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "The beast you saw existed, does not exist now, but is about to come up " ==
This phrase is intended to contrast the statement that Jesus "was and is and is to come" used elsewhere in Scripture. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== The use of paradox ==

This is a seemingly absurd statement, which appears to contradict itself. A paradox occurs in this chapter: the beast "is himself also an eighth king; but he is one of those seven kings." The translator should not attempt to resolve this paradox and it should remain a mystery.
