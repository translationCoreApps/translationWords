=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== Saul rescues the people of Jabesh Gilead ==

Nahash, king of the Ammonites, and his army surrounded the Israeli town of Jabesh Gilead. When the city's leaders asked for peace terms, Nahash demanded the right to poke out one eye of every man in order to show Israel their weakness. When Saul heard this, he called for all of Israel to help save this city. Many people came to help Saul's army. Israel was victorious and everyone wanted Saul as their king. At this time, Israel was not a truly unified country, even though it is often spoken of as one country. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:save]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
