<usfm>
\v 13 \add All this that I am saying about John is confirmed by the fact that\add* all the men who wrote the Scriptures \f + \ft metonymy, synecdoche \f* foretold \add about God ruling people's lives\add*, until John \add the Baptizer came\add*.
\v 14 \add Even though most of you are unwilling to believe what I am saying, I will tell this truth to\add* anyone who is willing to believe \add it:\add* John is \add the man who is like\add* Elijah \f + \ft metaphor \f*. He is the one who \add one of the prophets said\add* would come \add in order to prepare the people to welcome the Messiah\add*.
\v 15 If you want to understand this, you must think \add carefully\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add about what I have just said\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*."

\v 13 Everything that I am saying about John is just what you can read in what the prophets have written and what the law has been saying until the time of John the Baptizer.
\v 14 Not only that, but if you are willing to try to understand this, I will tell you that John is in fact the second Elijah, the prophet who was to come in the future.
\v 15 If you want to understand this, you must think carefully about what I have just said.

\v 13 For all the prophets and the law have been prophesying until John.
\v 14 And if you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, the one who was to come.
\v 15 He who has ears to hear, let him listen.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.

  * **all the prophets and the law have been prophesying until John** - Here "prophets and the law" refer to the things that the prophets and Moses wrote in scripture. AT: "for these are the things that the prophets and Moses have prophesied through the scriptures until the time of John the Baptist" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **And if you** - Here "you" is plural and refers to the crowd. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **this is Elijah, the one who was to come** - "This" refers to John the Baptist. This does not mean John the Baptist is literally Elijah. Jesus means John the Baptist fulfills the prophecy about "Elijah, who is to come" or the next Elijah. AT: "when the prophet Malachi said that Elijah would return, he was speaking about John the Baptist"
  * **He who has ears to hear** - This is a way of referring to everyone listening. AT: "Everyone who is listening to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **let him listen** - Here "listen" means paying attention. AT: "must pay careful attention to what I am saying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
