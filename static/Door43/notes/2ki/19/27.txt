===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues the message from Yahweh, given by Isaiah, the prophet, for King Hezekiah concerning King Sennecherib.  It uses parallelism throughout. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **raging against me** - "angry shouting about me"
  * **because your arrogance has reached my ears** - "Ears" are metonymy for listening or hearing. AT: "because I have heard your proud words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will put my hook in your nose, and my bit in your mouth** - A "hook" and a "bit" (to control a horse) are metaphors for Yahweh's control of Sennacherib. AT: "I will lead you like an animal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will turn you back the way you came** - That Sennacherib will return home before he can conquer Jerusalem can be stated clearly. AT: "I will make you return to your own country the same way you came, without conquering Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
