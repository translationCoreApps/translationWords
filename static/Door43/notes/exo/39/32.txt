\v 32 So the work on the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was finished. The people of Israel did everything. They followed all the instructions that Yahweh had given to Moses.
\v 33 They brought the tabernacle to Moses—the tent and all its equipment, its clasps, boards, bars, posts, and bases;
\v 34 the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of sea cow leather, and the curtain to conceal 
\v 35 the ark of the covenant decrees, as well as the poles and the atonement lid.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The Israelites finish making the things Yahweh commanded in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:35:04|35:4-9]] and [[:en:bible:notes:exo:35:10|35:10-12]].

  * **So the work on the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was finished. The people of Israel did everything** - The "tabernacle" and "tent of meeting" are the same thing. This can be stated in active form. AT: "So the people of Israel finished all of the work on the tabernacle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **clasp** - The clasps fit into the loops to hold the curtains together. See how you translated these in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:26:04|26:4-6]].
  * **bases** - These are heavy objects that rest on the ground and keep the object attached to them from moving. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:25:31|25:31]].
  * **atonement lid** - This is the lid that sits on top of the ark where the atonement offering was made. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:25:15|25:17]].
