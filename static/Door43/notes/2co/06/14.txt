\v 14 Do not team up\f + \ft Or: have a close relationship \f* with anyone who does not trust  \add in Christ. I say this\add* because we who  \add trust in Christ and do\add* what is right should not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add want to do things\add* with wicked people. Or  \add to say it in another way\add*, just like light and darkness never join together, so  \add those who belong to Christ and those who belong to Satan should never join together\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
\v 15 There is no \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* agreement of any kind between Christ and Satan. \add So\add*, believers have no \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* common interests with unbelievers.
\v 16  \add Just\add* as no one would  \add dare to bring\add* idols into the Temple  \add in Jerusalem\add*, believers should never \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* join with those who worship idols. \add I say that\add* because \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add the Holy Spirit lives in us, and so\add* we are  \add like\add* the Temple of the all-powerful God\add . It is\add* as God himself said  \add in the Scriptures\add*:
\q I will live in  \add my people\add*.
\q I will always be with\f + \ft Or: helping \f* them. 
\q  \add They will say to me\add*, "You are our God," and 
\q  \add I will say to them\add*, "You are my people."

\v 14 Do not work in unsuitable ways with people who do not trust Christ. What do people who live by God's measure and rules have in common with those who break his laws and do what they want? Darkness and light cannot be together.
\v 15 How can Christ agree in any way with the demon Beliar? What does a person who trusts in God have in common with another person who does not trust in God?
\v 16 How right would it be to bring pagan idols into the temple of God? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said:
\q "I will have my home among my people.
\q I will live my life among them. 
\q I will be their God 
\q and they will be my people."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Do not be tied together with unbelievers. For what association does righteousness have with lawlessness? And what fellowship does light have with darkness?
\v 15 What agreement can Christ have with Beliar? Or what share does a believer have together with an unbeliever?
\v 16 And what agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said:
\q "I will dwell among them and walk among them.
\q I will be their God, 
\q1 and they will be my people."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verse 16, Paul paraphrases portions from several Old Testament prophets: Moses, Zechariah, Amos, and possibly others. 

  * **Do not be tied together with unbelievers** - This can be stated in positive terms. AT: "Only be tied together with believers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **be tied together with** - Paul speaks of working together toward a common purpose as if it were two animals tied together to pull a plow or cart. AT: "team up with" or "have a close relationship with" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For what association does righteousness have with lawlessness?** - This is a rhetorical question that anticipates a negative answer. AT: "For righteousness can have no association with lawlessness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **And what fellowship does light have with darkness?** - Paul asks this question to emphasize that light and darkness cannot coexist since light dispels darkness. The words "light" and "darkness" refer to the moral and spiritual qualities of believers and unbelievers. AT: "And light can have no fellowship with darkness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **What agreement can Christ have with Beliar?** - This is a rhetorical question that anticipates a negative answer. AT: "There is no agreement between Christ and Beliar" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Beliar** - This is another name for the devil. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Or what share does a believer have together with an unbeliever?** - This is a rhetorical question that anticipates a negative answer. AT: "A believer shares nothing in common with an unbeliever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **And what agreement is there between the temple of God and idols?** - This is a rhetorical question that anticipates a negative answer. AT: "There is no agreement between the temple of God and idols" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **we are the temple of the living God** - Paul refers to all Christians as forming a temple for God to dwell in. AT: "we are like a temple where the living God dwells" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
