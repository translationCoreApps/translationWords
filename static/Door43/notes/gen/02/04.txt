\v 4 These were the events concerning the heavens and the earth, when they were created, on the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens.
\v 5 No bush of the field was yet in the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground.
\v 6 But a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.
