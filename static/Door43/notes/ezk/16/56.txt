<usfm>
\v 56 Sodom your sister was not even mentioned by your mouth in the days when you were proud,
\v 57 before your wickedness was revealed. But now you are an object of scorn to the daughters of Edom and to all the daughters of the Philistines around her. People all about despise you.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa Edom \fqb , some ancient copies and modern versions have \fqa Aram \fqb , that is, Syria. \f*
\v 58 You will show your shame and your disgusting actions!â€”this is Yahweh's declaration!
