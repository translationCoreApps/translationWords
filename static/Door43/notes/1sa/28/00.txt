====== 1 Samuel 28 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Talking to the dead ==

Talking to the dead was against the law of Moses. God or the Holy Spirit left Saul because of his sin and would not help him. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:dead]], [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]], [[:en:obe:kt:holyspirit]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical question ==
Samuel uses a rhetorical question to say it was useless to ask his advice since there was no way Saul could be successful with God against him: "What then do you ask me, since Yahweh has left you, and he has become your enemy?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
