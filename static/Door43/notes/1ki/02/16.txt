  * **do not turn away from my face ... he will not turn away from your face** - Turning from the face of someone is a metonym for refusing to look at someone, which in turn is a metonym for refusing to do what that person requests. AT: "do not refuse to do what I request ... he will not refuse to do what you request" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
