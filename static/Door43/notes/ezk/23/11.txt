\v 11 Her sister Oholibah saw this, but she lusted even more passionately and acted like a prostitute even more than her sister.
\v 12 She lusted for the Assyrians, the governors and the dominating officials who dressed impressively, who were men riding horses. All of them were strong, handsome men.
\v 13 I saw that she had made herself unclean. It was the same for both sisters.
