\v 21 The rest of the land on either side of the holy offering and the city area will be for the prince. The prince's tract of land to the east will extend for twenty-five thousand cubits from boundary of the holy offering to the eastern border—and his tract to the west will extend for twenty-five thousand cubits to the western border. In the middle will be the holy offering, and the holy place of the temple will be in its midst.
\v 22 The land extending from the property of the Levites and the area of the city in its midst will be for for the prince; it will be between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin—this land will be for the prince.
