====== Haggai 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:4-11, which is the poetic part of the quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Farming imagery ==
Scripture frequently uses the imagery of farming in reference to spiritual matters. The statement, "You have sown much seed, but bring in little harvest" indicates that they had done a lot but have very little to show for it. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]] and [[:en:obe:kt:seed]])
