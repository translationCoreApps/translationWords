\v 6 Abram passed through the land as far as Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites lived in the land.
\v 7 Yahweh appeared to Abram, and said, "To your descendants I will give this land." So there Abram built an altar to Yahweh, who had appeared to him.

  * **the land** - "the land of Canaan"
  * **the oak of Moreh** - Moreh was probably the name of a place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
