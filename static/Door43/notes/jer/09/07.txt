<usfm>
\v 7 Therefore I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, say this:
\q1 Listen carefully to what I say: I will \add cause great afflictions to come on my people\add*,
\q2 \add like a metalworker puts metal in a hot fire\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* to completely burn out the impure bits.
\q1 Because of all \add the evil things\add* that my people have done,
\q2 there is absolutely nothing else \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that I can do.
\q1
\v 8 What they say \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add injures people like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* poisoned arrows do.
\q1 They say to their neighbors, 'I hope things will go well for you,'
\q2 while they are planning to kill them.
\q1
\v 9 Should I not punish them for doing that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q2 Yes, I should certainly get revenge on\f + \ft Or: give what they deserve to \f* the people of a nation that does things like that!"

<usfm>
\v 7 Therefore I, Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, say this:
\q Listen carefully to what I say: I will test my people, like a metalworker puts metal in a hot fire to completely burn out the impure bits.
\q Because of all the evil things that my people have done, there is absolutely nothing else that I can do.
\q
\v 8 What they say injures people like poisoned arrows do.
\q They say to their neighbors, 'I hope things will go well for you,' while they are planning to kill them.
\q
\v 9 Should I not punish them for doing that?
\q Yes, I should certainly get revenge on the people of a nation that does things like that!"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 7 So Yahweh of hosts says this, "See, I am about to test them. I will examine them.
\q How else should I act for the daughter of my people?
\q
\v 8 Their tongues are sharpened arrows; they speak unfaithful things.
\q With their mouths they proclaim peace with their neighbors, but with their hearts they lie in wait for them.
\q
\v 9 Should I not punish them because of these things—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q and should I not avenge myself on a nation that is like this?
