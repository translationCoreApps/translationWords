====== Genesis 13:5-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks of sheep and goats and herds of cattle and tents.
\v 6-7 But they had so many animals that they could not all stay in the same area. There was not enough land to provide water and food for all their animals. Furthermore, the descendants of Canaan and Perez were also living in that area, and the land really belonged to them. So the men who took care of Abram's animals started quarreling about the herd with the men who took care of Lot's animals.

\v 6 The two of them had so many animals that they could not all stay in the same area. There was not enough land to provide water and food for all their animals.
\v 7 Furthermore, the men who took care of Abram's livestock started quarreling with the men who took care of Lot's livestock. The descendants of Canaan and Perez were also living in that area.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Now Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks, herds, and tents.
\v 6 The land was not able to support them both living close together, because their possessions were very many, so that they could not stay together.
\v 7 Also, there was a dispute between the herdsmen of Abram's animals and the herdsmen of Lot's animals. The Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land at that time.
