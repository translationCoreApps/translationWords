\v 14 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: Your brother Israel says this: "You know all the difficulties that have happened to us.
\v 15 You know that our ancestors went down to Egypt and lived in Egypt a long time. The Egyptians treated us harshly and also our ancestors.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Your brother Israel** - Moses uses this phrase to emphasize that the Israelites and the Edomites are related because their ancestors, Jacob and Esau, were brothers.
  * **When we called out to Yahweh** - "When we prayed to Yahweh begging him to help us"
  * **he heard our voice** - Here "voice" represents their crying or what they said to him. AT:  "he heard our cry" or "he heard what we asked for" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Look** - "Look" here marks a change in topic. They were just speaking about their past. Now they speak about their present situation as they prepare to ask the king to do something.
