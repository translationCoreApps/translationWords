<usfm>
\v 24 Then the world will come to an end, when Christ will present all the world to God the Father, for him to rule. This is when Christ will bring to an end all who have the status of rulers, and everything that has reigning authority and all seats of power in this world.
\v 25 For Christ must rule until God has conquered every one of his enemies, and placed them under Christ's feet to show that they have no more power.
\v 26 The final enemy that God will destroy is death itself.
