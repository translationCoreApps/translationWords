===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:yahweh]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:death]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:kiss]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:raise]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **daughters-in-law** - "sons' wives" or "sons' widows"
  * **each of you** - Naomi was talking to two people, so languages that have a dual form of "you" would use that throughout her talk. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **your mother's house** - "to the home of each of your mothers"
  * **shown kindness** - "demonstrated that you are loyal"
  * **kindness** - "kindness" includes the ideas of love, kindness, and faithfulness.
  * **toward the dead** - "to your husbands, who died." Naomi was referring to her two sons that died. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **grant you** - "give you" or "allow you to have"
  * **rest** - "Rest" here includes security in marriage.
  * **in the house of another husband** - with their new husbands, not someone else's husband. This refers to both a physical house that belongs to the husband, and to the protection from shame by being married. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they raised their voices and cried** - This means that the daughters cried out loud or wept bitterly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **We will return** - When Orpah and Ruth said "we," they were referring to themselves and not Naomi. So languages that have inclusive and exclusive "we" would use the exclusive form here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **with you** - Here "you" is the singular form referring to Naomi. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
