\v 17 This is why the Father loves me: I lay down my life so that I may take it again.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus finishes speaking to the crowd.

  * **This is why the Father loves me: I lay down my life** - God's eternal plan was for God the Son to give his life to pay for the sins of humanity. Jesus' death on the cross reveals the intense love of the Son for the Father and of the Father for the Son.
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **loves** - This kind of love comes from God and is focused on the good of others, even when it does not benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do. 
  * **I lay down my life so that I may take it again** - This is a mild way for Jesus to say he will die and then will become alive again. AT: "I allow myself to die in order that I may bring myself back to life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **I lay it down of myself** - The reflexive pronoun "myself" is used here to emphasize that Jesus lays down his own life. No one takes it from him. AT: "I myself lay it down" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
  * **I have received this command from my Father** - "This is what my Father has commanded me to do." The word "Father" is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
