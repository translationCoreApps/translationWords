===== translationNotes: =====

  * **See, I was born in iniquity ... See, you desire trustworthiness** - The two uses of "See" here draw our attention to the contrast between these two situations. AT: "Truly I was born in iniquity ... But you desire trustworthiness" 
  * **See, I was born in iniquity ... as soon as my mother conceived me, I was in sin** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are used together for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I was born in iniquity** - Being a sinner is spoken of as being in iniquity. AT: "I was already a sinner when I was born" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **as soon as my mother conceived me, I was in sin** - Being a sinner is spoken of as being in sin. AT: "even when my mother conceived me, I was a sinner" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you desire trustworthiness in my heart** - The heart represents either 1) the person's desires or 2) the whole person. AT: "You want me to desire trustworthiness" or "you want me to be trustworthy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
