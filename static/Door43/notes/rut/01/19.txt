\v 19 So the two women continued walking until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived there, everyone in the town was very happy to see them. The women of the town exclaimed, "It is hard to believe that this is Naomi!"
\v 20 Naomi said to them, "You should not call me Naomi any more, because it means 'pleasant.' Instead, call me Mara, because it means 'bitter.' God Almighty has made my life very bitter.
\v 21 When I left here my life was full because I had a family. But Yahweh has brought me back here empty, without my family. Do not call me Naomi. Yahweh has punished me. Almighty God has caused a great tragedy to happen to me."

\v 19 So the two traveled until they came to the town of Bethlehem. It happened that when they arrived in Bethlehem, the entire town was very excited about them. The women said, "Is this Naomi?"
\v 20 But she said to them, "Do not call me Naomi. Call me Bitter, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
\v 21 I went out full, but Yahweh has brought me home again empty. So why do you call me Naomi, seeing Yahweh has condemned me, that the Almighty has afflicted me?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It happened** - "It came about." This is marking a new storyline. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])
  * **the entire town** - "everyone in the town" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Is this Naomi?** - Since it has been many years since Naomi lived in Bethlehem and no longer has her husband and two sons, it is likely the women were expressing doubt as to if this woman was actually Naomi. Treat as a real question, not rhetorical.
  * **Do not call me Naomi** - The name "Naomi" means "my delight." Since Naomi lost her husband and sons, she no longer feels her life matches her name.
  * **Bitter** - This is a translation of the meaning of the name. It is also often translated according to its sound as "Mara." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **I went out full, but Yahweh has brought me home again empty** - When Naomi left Bethlehem, her husband and two sons were living, and she was happy. Naomi blames Yahweh for the death of her husband and sons, saying that he has caused her to return to Bethlehem without them, and now she is bitter and unhappy.
  * **condemned me** - "judged me guilty"
  * **has afflicted me** - "has brought calamity on me" or "has brought tragedy to me"
