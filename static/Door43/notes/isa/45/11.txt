===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Holy One of Israel** - Translate this phrase in the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:04|1:4]].
  * **Why do you ask questions about what I will do for my children? Do you tell me what to do concerning the work of my hands?** - Yahweh uses questions to scold those who argue with him about what he does. AT: "Do not question me about what I do for my children. Do not tell me ... my hands." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **my children** - This refers to the people of Israel.
  * **the work of my hands** - Here the word "hands" represents Yahweh. AT: "the things that I have made" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
