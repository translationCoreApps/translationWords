\v 9 There was a time in the past when I, too, was sure that I should do everything that I could to stop people from believing in Jesus from Nazareth town.
\v 10 So that is what I did when I lived in Jerusalem. I shut up many of the believers in prison, as the chief priests there had given me power to do. And when their people killed believers, I voted in favor of that.
\v 11 Often I punished those Jewish people who trusted in Jesus. I searched for them everywhere and in every synagogue. I was so angry with them because they followed Jesus as the Christ, that I would force them, using all my might, so they would insult God and to curse his name. When they cursed God, they could be put to death. My anger toward them was so strong that I wanted them to be tried and condemned to death when they appeared before the Jewish courts. I always cast my vote in favor of their execution. I even went off to foreign cities to find them so I could arrest them, bring them back to Jerusalem, and then punish them. I wanted them to be killed.

\v 9 At one time I thought to myself that I should do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
\v 10 I did these in Jerusalem. I locked up many of the believers in prison by the authority I received from the chief priests, and when they were killed, I cast my vote against them.
\v 11 I punished them many times in all the synagogues and I tried to force them to blaspheme. I was furiously enraged against them and I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
