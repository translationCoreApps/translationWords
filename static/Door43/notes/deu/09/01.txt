\v 1 Hear, Israel; you are about to cross over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, and cities that are great and fortified up to heaven,
\v 2 a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard people say, 'Who can stand before the sons of Anak?'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to speak to the Israelites as if they are one person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **Hear, Israel** - "Listen, people of Israel." The word "Israel" is a metonym for the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to dispossess** - "to take the land from"
  * **fortified up to heaven** - This is an exaggeration that emphasizes how frightened the people were because the cities were so large and strong. AT: "have very tall walls" See how you translated similar words in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:01:26|1:28]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **sons of the Anakim** - Descendants of the Anak people who were very large and fierce. See how you translated similar words in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:01:26|1:28]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Who can stand before the sons of Anak?** - This means that the sons of Anak were powerful and people were afraid of them. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "There is no one who can defend himself against the sons of Anak." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
