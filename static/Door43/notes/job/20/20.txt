<usfm>
\q
\v 20 Because he has known no satisfaction himself,
\q he will not be able to save anything in which he takes pleasure.
\q
\v 21 There is nothing left that he did not devour;
\q therefore his prosperity will not be permanent.
\q
\v 22 In the abundance of his wealth he will fall into trouble;
\q the hand of everyone who is in poverty will come against him.
