\v 21 Even though many people habitually call me Lord, pretending that they have my authority, God will not agree to rule from heaven over some of them, because they do not do what he desires. My Father will agree to rule over only those who do what he wants.
\v 22 On the day that God judges everyone, many people will say to me, 'Lord, we spoke God's message as your representatives! As your representatives we drove out demons from people! And as your representatives, many times we performed mighty deeds!'
\v 23 Then I will publicly say to them, 'I have never admitted that you belonged to me. Go away from me, you who do what is evil!'"

<usfm>
\v 21 Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
\v 22 Many people will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, in your name drive out demons, and in your name do many mighty deeds?'
\v 23 Then will I openly declare to them, 'I never knew you! Get away from me, you evildoers!'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **will enter into the kingdom of heaven** - Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used only in the book of Matthew. If possible, keep "heaven" in your translation. AT: "will live with God in heaven when he shows himself to be king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven** - "whoever does what my Father in heaven desires"
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **in that day** - Jesus said "that day" knowing his hearers would understand he was referring to the day of judgment. You should include "the day of judgment" only if your readers would not understand otherwise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **did we not prophesy ... drive out demons ... do many mighty deeds?** - The people use a question to emphasize that they did these things. AT: "we prophesied ... drove out demons ... did many mighty deeds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **we** - This "we" does not include Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **in your name** - Here "name" means with the power and authority of Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **mighty deeds** - "miracles"
  * **I never knew you** - This means the person does not belong to Jesus. AT: "You are not my follower" or "I have nothing to do with you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
