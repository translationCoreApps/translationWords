===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Verses 6-12 repeat for a second time and give more detail about how Noah went into the ark with his family and the animals in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:07:01|7:1-5]]. This is not a new event.

  * **In the six hundredth year of Noah's life** - "When Noah was 600 years old" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month** - Since Moses wrote this book, it is possible he is referring to the second month of the Hebrew calendar. But this is uncertain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **on the same day** - This refers to the specific day when the rain began. This phrase emphasizes how all of these major events happened quickly when the time arrived.
  * **the fountains of the great deep burst open** - "water from under the earth rushed up to the earth's surface" 
  * **the great deep** - This refers to the sea that was thought to be under the earth.
  * **the windows of heaven were opened** - This refers to rain. It describes the sky as a ceiling that keeps the waters above it from falling down to the earth. When the windows, or doors, in the sky were opened, the water came down through them. AT: "the sky opened" or "the doors in the sky opened" 
  * **rain** - If your language has a word for a great amount of rain, it would be appropriate here.
