\v 29 Then the king said to him, "Why explain anything further? I have decided that you and Ziba will divide the fields."
\v 30 So Mephibosheth replied to the king, "Yes, let him take it all, since my master the king has come safely to his own home."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Why explain anything further?** - David uses this rhetorical question to tell him that he does not need to continue talking about his conflict with Ziba. This can be written as a statement. AT: "You do not need to explain this any further." or "You certainly do not need to say any more." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
