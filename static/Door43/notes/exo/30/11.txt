\v 11 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said,
\v 12 "When you take a census of the Israelites, then each person must give a ransom for his life to Yahweh. You must do this after you count them, so that there will be no plague among them when you count them.
\v 13 Everyone who is counted in the census is to pay half a shekel of silver, according to the weight of the shekel of the sanctuary (a shekel is the same as twenty gerahs). This half shekel will be an offering to me, Yahweh.
\v 14 Everyone who is counted, from twenty years old and up, must give this offering to me.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **When you take** - Possible meanings are 1) "you" refers to just Moses or 2) "you" refers to Moses and the leaders of Israel in future generations when they take a census. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **a census of the Israelites** - The leaders only counted the Israelite men.
  * **Everyone who is counted** - This can be stated in active form. They counted only the men. AT: "Everyone you count" or "Every man you count" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **half a shekel of silver** - "1/2 a shekel of silver." Translators may use a unit of measure that people understand and a round number: "5.5 grams of silver" or "six grams of silver" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]])
  * **according to the weight of the shekel of the sanctuary** - There were evidently shekels of more than one weight at the time. This specified which one was to be used. 
  * **twenty gerahs** - "20 gerahs." A gerah is a unit that people used for measuring how much something very small weighed. (See:  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **from twenty years old and up** - Larger numbers are spoken of as being up or above smaller numbers. AT: "from twenty years old and more" or "who is twenty years old or older" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
