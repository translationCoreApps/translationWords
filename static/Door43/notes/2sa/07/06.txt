\v 6 For I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up the people of Israel out of Egypt until this present day; instead, I have been moving about in a tent, a tabernacle.
\v 7 In all places where I have moved among all the people of Israel, did I ever say anything to any of Israel's leaders whom I appointed to shepherd my people Israel, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'"

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **did I ever say anything to any of Israel's leaders ... "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"** - God told David that he did not require any of Israel's leaders to honor him by building a temple to him made of cedar wood. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "I have never asked any of the leaders, whom I appointed, to build me a temple of cedar wood." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
