====== Exodus 40 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is repetitive and should read as a series of instructions. It is repeated as well to show that Moses was obedient to every detail of Yahweh's command. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Yahweh's glory filled the tabernacle" ==
This phrase indicates that Yahweh began to dwell within the tabernacle, among Israel, in a special way. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:glory]] and [[:en:obe:kt:tabernacle]])
