\v 9 After he said that, he rose up into heaven, and a cloud kept them from seeing him any longer.
\p
\v 10 While the apostles were still staring toward the sky as he was going up, suddenly two men wearing white clothes stood beside them. They were angels.
\v 11 One of them said, "You men from Galilee, you do not need to stand here any longer looking up at the sky! Some day this same Jesus, whom God took from you up to heaven, will come back to earth. He will return in the same manner as you just now saw him go when he went up to heaven."

\v 9 When the Lord Jesus had said these things, as they were looking up, he was raised up, and a cloud hid him from their eyes.
\v 10 While they were looking intensely to heaven as he went, suddenly, two men stood by them in white clothing.
\v 11 They said, "You men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking into heaven? This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, will return in the same manner as you saw him going into heaven."
