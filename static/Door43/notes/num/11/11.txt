\v 11 Moses said to Yahweh, "Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why are you not pleased with me? You make me carry the load of all these people.
\v 12 Did I conceive all these people? Have I given them birth so that you should say to me, 'Carry them closely to your chest as a father carries a baby?' Should I carry them to the land that you swore to their ancestors to give them?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses complains to Yahweh using several rhetorical questions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

  * **Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why are you not pleased with me?** - Moses used these questions to complain about the way God was treating him. They can be expressed as statements. AT: "You should not treat me, your servant, so badly. You should not be angry with me" or "I, your servant, have done nothing wrong for you to treat me so badly." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **You make me carry the load of all these people** - Moses complains and speaks of leading the people and providing for them as if he were carrying a heavy load. AT: "You make me responsible for all these people, but it's too hard for me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Did I conceive all these people? Have I given them birth so that you should say to me** - Moses used these questions to get God to think about the fact that Moses was not their father. AT: "I am not the father of all these people. So it is not fair that you should say to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Carry them closely to your chest as a father carries a baby** - This means that Moses is to be responsible for the people who cannot take care of themselves, as a parent must care for an infant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Should I carry them ... to give them?** - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You should not expect me to carry them ... to give them" or "I am not able to carry them ... to give them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
