===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The sea looked and fled** - The writer speaks of the Sea of Reeds as if it were a person who fled away as Yahweh led the people of Israel through on dry ground. AT: "It was as though the sea looked and fled" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **the Jordan turned back** - The writer speaks of the Jordan River as if it were a person who retreated as Yahweh led the people of Israel through on dry ground. AT: "it was as though the Jordan retreated" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **The mountains skipped like rams, the hills skipped like lambs** - The writer speaks of the mountains and hills as if they are alive. He is probably speaking of an earthquake when he describes their fear at the presence of Yahweh as if they were jumping like rams and lambs. AT: "It was as if the mountains shook like jumping rams and the hills shook like jumping lambs" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
