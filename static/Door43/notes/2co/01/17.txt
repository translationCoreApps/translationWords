\v 17 So then, even though I \add changed my mind later and did not do what\add* I \add first\add* planned to do, \add it was not because I did not have an important reason for changing my plans\add*. Surely you do not\add really think\add* that I decide on what I am going to do like people who do not know God do!\f + \ft Or: Do you \add really think\add* that I decide on what I am going to do like people who do not know God do? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* I am \add not like that\add*. I am not \add a person who\add* says \add to people\add*, "Yes, \add certainly I will do that\add*," and then \add for no good reason changes his mind and says\add*, "No, \add I will not do it\add*."
\v 18 Just as surely as God always does what he says \add he will do, it is true that I have never said\add*, "Yes, \add I will do this\add*" when I \add really meant\add* "No."

\v 17 My mind was made up that this would be the plan. I was not telling you "Yes" and then telling you "No." I was not making my plans like unbelievers often make plans.
\v 18 But God is faithful in guiding us, and we do not confuse you, either. We are making our plans and staying with them.

\v 17 When I was thinking this way, was I hesitating? Do I plan things according to human standards, so that I say "Yes, yes" and "No, no" at the same time?
\v 18 But just as God is faithful, we do not say both "Yes" and "No."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **was I hesitating?** - Paul uses this question to emphasize he was sure about his decision to visit the Corinthians. The expected answer to the question is no. AT: "I was not hesitating" or "I was confident in my decision" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do I plan things according to human standards ... at the same time?** - Paul uses this question to emphasize that his plans to visit the Corinthians were sincere. AT: "I do not plan things according to human standards ... at the same time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **so that I say "Yes, yes" and "No, no" at the same time** - This means that Paul did not say both that he would visit and that he would not visit at the same time. The words "yes" and "no" are repeated for emphasis. AT: "so that I say 'Yes, I will certainly visit' and 'No, I will definitely not visit' at the same time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
