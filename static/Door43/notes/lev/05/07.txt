\v 7 If he cannot afford to buy a lamb, then he can bring as his guilt offering for his sin two doves or two young pigeons to Yahweh, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
\v 8 He must bring them to the priest, who will offer one for the sin offering firstâ€”he will wring off its head from its neck but will not remove it completely from the body.
\v 9 Then he will sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, and he will drain the rest of the blood out at the base of the altar. This is a sin offering.
