\v 17 So when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Who do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
\v 18 He knew that they had handed Jesus over to him because of envy.
\v 19 While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him and said, "Have nothing to do with that innocent man. For I have suffered much today because of a dream I had about him."
