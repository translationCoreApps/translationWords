====== John 14:15-17 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 "If you love me, you will do what I have commanded you.
\v 16 Then I myself will request \add my\add* Father, and he will send you someone else who will encourage\f + \ft Or: be like a legal counsel for \f* you.
\v 17 \add I am talking about\add* the Spirit, who \add will teach you God's\add* truth. He will be with you forever. Those who are opposed to God \f + \ft metonymy \f* cannot receive him, because they cannot understand what he \add does\add*, and they cannot know who he is. But you know who he is, because he is with you and he will be inside you.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 If you love me, you will live as I have taught you.
\v 16 Then I will ask the Father to give you another gift, and he will send you another Helper, one who will come alongside you to be with you forever.
\v 17 He is the Spirit who tells the truth about God. The unbelieving people in this world will never welcome Him. The world cannot see him or know him. You know him because he lives with you and he will be joined to you.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 If you love me, you will keep my commandments,
\v 16 and I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another Comforter so that he will be with you foreverâ€”
\v 17 the Spirit of truth. The world cannot receive him because it does not see him or know him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.
