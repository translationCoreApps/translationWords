===== translationNotes: =====

  * **our mouths were filled with laughter** - Laughing is spoken of as if their mouths were a container and their laughter was in it. It can be made clear that this laughter was a response to their joy. AT: "we laughed for joy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **our tongues with singing** - The verbs "were filled" can be stated clearly. Singing is spoken of as if their tongues were containers and singing was in them. AT: "our tongues were filled with singing" or "we sang songs of joy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **they said among the nations** - "the people of the nations said among themselves." The pronoun is used before introducing what it references. This is very unusual.
  * **Yahweh did great things for us; how glad we were!** - "How glad we were, because Yahweh did these great things for us!"
