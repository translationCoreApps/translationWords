====== Hebrews 13 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 13:6, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

This chapter continues a series of exhortations to Christians that began in chapter 12. These commands are not always connected to each other, therefore the translator should not feel obliged to make smooth transitions between subjects.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Welcome angels" ==
The exact meaning of this phrase is unknown. It is possibly a reference to Abraham entertaining angels (Genesis 18). The Greek word for "angels" can also be translated as "messengers." This would give the phrase the meaning that any stranger may be a messenger or servant of God, so hospitality should be shown to them.
