\v 13 What salt does for food, this is what you will do for the world. But if salt loses its power, no one can make it good again. People just throw it out and walk over it.
\v 14 What light does for people in the dark, this is what you will do for the world. All people will see you, just as they see a city built on a hillside.

\v 13 You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again? It is never again good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.
\v 14 You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins to teach about how his disciples are like salt and light.

  * **You are the salt of the earth** - Possible meanings are 1) just as salt makes food good, a disciple of Jesus must influence the people of the world so that they will be good. AT: "You are like salt for the people of the world" or 2) just as salt preserves food, a disciple of Jesus must keep people from becoming totally corrupt. AT: "As salt is for food, you are for the world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
  * **if the salt has lost its taste** - Possible meanings are 1) "if the salt has lost its power to do things that salt does" (UDB) or 2) "if the salt has lost its flavor." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **how can it be made salty again?** - "how can it be made useful again?" Jesus uses a question to teach the disciples. AT: "there is no way for it to become useful again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "except for people to throw it out into the road and walk on it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **You are the light of the world** - This means Jesus' followers bring the message of God's truth to all the people who do not know God. AT: "You are like a light for the people of the world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **A city set on a hill cannot be hidden** - At night when it is dark, people can see the city lights shining. This can be stated in active form. AT: "During the night, no one can hide the lights that shine from a city on a hill" or "Everyone sees the lights of a city on a hill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
