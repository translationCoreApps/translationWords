\v 27 The people of Manasseh did not drive out the people living in the cities of Beth Shan and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or those who lived in Dor and its villages, or those who lived in Ibleam and its villages, or those who lived in Megiddo and its villages, because the Canaanites were determined to live in that land.
\v 28 When Israel became strong, they forced the Canaanites to serve them with hard labor, but they never drove them out completely.
