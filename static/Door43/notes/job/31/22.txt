===== translationNotes: =====

  * **then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade, and let my arm be broken from its joint** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "then let someone tear off my shoulder from the shoulder blade and break my arm from its joint" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For I dreaded ... his majesty** - This is the reason that Job did not do any of the wicked things he spoke of in verses 7 through 21.
