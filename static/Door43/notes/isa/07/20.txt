\v 21 When that happens, a farmer will be able to have only one cow and two goats\f + \ft Or: sheep \f*.
\v 22 However, those animals will give plenty of milk, with the result that the farmer will have curds\f + \ft Or: yogurt \f* to eat. And \add because there will not be many people left\add* in the land, all the people who remain there will have plenty of milk and honey.

\v 20 At that time Yahweh will hire the king of Assyria to come with his army from east of the Euphrates River. They will get rid of everything in your land—the crops and the people. They will destroy everything thoroughly; it will be like a barber shaving not only a man's hair but his beard and the hair on his legs.
\v 21 When that happens, a farmer will be able to keep alive only one young cow and two goats.
\v 22 However, those animals will give plenty of milk, with the result that the farmer will have curds to eat. And because there will not be many people left in the land, all the people who remain there will have plenty of milk and honey.

\p
\v 20 At that time the Lord will shave with a razor that was hired beyond the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria—
\q1 the head and the hair of the legs; it will also sweep away the beard.
\q1
\v 21 On that day, a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep,
\q1
\v 22 and because of the abundance of milk which they shall give, he will eat curds,
\q1 for everyone left in the land  will eat curds and honey.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah continues to describe the time when the army of Assyria will attack Israel.

  * **the Lord will shave with a razor that was hired beyond the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria** - The word "razor" is a metaphor for the king of Assyria and his army, and Yahweh speaks of the king as if the king were a man who would do Yahweh's work and then receive money from Yahweh. AT: "the Lord will call the king of Assyria from beyond the Euphrates River to work for him to shave you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **that was hired** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that he bought" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the head ... the hair of the legs ... also ... the beard** - It was bad to have someone shave the top of the head; it was worse to have someone shave "the hair of the legs"; it was worst of all to have someone shave the beard. 
  * **the head ... the hair of the legs ... the beard** - Isaiah does not say whose head, hair, and beard the Lord is going to shave, but Ahaz and the reader would understand that this is a man; the man is a metaphor for the people living in the land of Judah (see UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the head** - "the hair on the head" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the hair of the legs** - Possible meanings are 1) this is a polite way to speak of the hair on the lower body or 2) this speaks of the hair on the legs. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **it will also sweep** - "the razor will also sweep." If your language requires a person to be the subject of "will ... sweep," you can say, "the Lord will also sweep."
  * **because of the abundance of milk which they shall give** - The abstract noun "abundance" can be translated as a clause. AT: "because they will give so much milk" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
