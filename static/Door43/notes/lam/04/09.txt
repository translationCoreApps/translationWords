<usfm>
\q
\v 9 Those who have been killed by the sword were happier than those killed by hunger,
\q who wasted away, pierced by the lack of any harvest from the field.
\q
\v 10 The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children; 
\q they became their food during the time 
\q when the daughter of my people was being destroyed. 
\b
