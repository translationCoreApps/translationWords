\v 11 Where now is the lions' den, the place where the young lion cubs feed,
\q the place where the lion and lioness walked, with the cubs, where they were afraid of nothing?
\q
\v 12 The lion tore his victims to pieces for his cubs; he strangled victims for his lionesses,
\q and filled his cave with victims, his dens with torn carcasses.

  * [[:en:obe:other:lion]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **lions' den** - Nineveh is being compared to a lion's den because it is a place where killers live and a place where they bring back what they have stolen from the people they have killed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **strangled** - "choked." Lions bite their victims' throats to prevent them from breathing.
  * **filled his cave with victims, his dens with torn carcasses** - These two phrases are saying the same thing in different ways. A lion's den, its hiding place, is often in a cave. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
