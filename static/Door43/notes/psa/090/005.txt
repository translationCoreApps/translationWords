===== translationNotes: =====


  * **You sweep them away as with a flood and they sleep** - God causing people to die suddenly is spoken of as if he swept them away with a broom. This sweeping is also spoken of as if it were a flood that carried people away. AT: "Lord, you destroy the people as with a flood and they die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **they sleep** - This is a polite way of speaking of people dying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **in the morning they are like the grass ... in the evening it withers and dries up** - The people are being compared to grass to emphasize that people do not live a very long time. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **it blooms and grows up** - Both of these phrases refer to how the grass grows. AT: "it begins to grow and develop" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **it withers and dries up** - Both of these phrases refer to how the grass dies. AT: "it fades and dries up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
