\v 1 You now are alive \add spiritually\add*, and \add it is as though you were raised\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God caused you to become alive\add* \f* when he caused Christ to become alive again. So be constantly wanting what is associated with heaven \f + \ft metonymy \f*, where Christ is. There God has given him supreme authority and the highest honor.
\v 2 Be constantly wanting the blessings that God has prepared for you in heaven \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Do not be constantly wanting \add to do the evil deeds that people on\add* earth do \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
\v 3 because you have \add ceased to behave as you formerly did. You are like people who have\add* died. You now live \add spiritually\add* together with Christ in \add the presence of\add* God; and \add people\add* cannot see that.
\v 4 When Christ, who causes you to live \add spiritually\add*, is publicly revealed, then God will also reveal you publicly together with Christ, \add and you together with Christ will be\add* glorious.

\v 1 God considers that he made you alive again when he made Christ alive after he died. And Christ is in heaven and is sitting at God's right side, the place for the person of greatest honor and power. You also should try to live here as if you were already there.
\v 2 Desire what Jesus is keeping in heaven to give you; do not desire the things here on earth.
\v 3 For God considers that you have died and no longer belong to this world. He considers that he has hidden you with Christ to keep you safe.
\v 4 When God reveals Christ to everyone on earth in his shining light, then he will also reveal you in that same light, because Christ makes you live!

\v 1 If then God has raised you with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.
\v 2 Think about the things above, not about the things on earth.
\v 3 For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
\v 4 When Christ appears, who is your life, then you will also appear with him in glory.
\f + \ft Some versions read, \fqa When Christ appears, who is our life, then you will also appear with him in glory. \fqb \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul warns the believers that because they are one with Christ, they ought not do certain things.

  * **God has raised you with Christ** - As God has raised Christ to heaven, so God counts the believers in Colossae as though he has also raised them to heaven. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **things above** - "things in heaven"
  * **For you have died** - As Christ actually died, so God counts the Colossian believers as having died with Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your life is hidden with Christ in God** - Paul speaks of people's lives as if they were objects that can be hidden in containers and speaks of God as if he were a container. AT: Possible meanings are 1) "it is as though God has taken your life and concealed it with Christ in God's presence" or 2) "only God knows what your true life really is, and he will reveal it when he reveals Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who is your life** - Christ is the one who gives spiritual life to the believer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
