\v 31 Job, have you or anyone else ever said to God, 'I have certainly committed sin,
\q2 but I will not sin anymore;
\q1
\v 32 so teach me what sins I have committed;
\q1 if I have done anything that is evil,
\q2 I will not do it anymore'?
\q1
\v 33 Job, you object to what God has done to you,
\q2 but do you think that he will do what you want him to do?
\q1 It is you who must choose what you should say to God, not I;
\q2 tell me what you are thinking about this.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 31 Suppose someone says to God,
\q 'I am certainly guilty, but I will not sin any longer;
\q
\v 32 teach me what I cannot see;
\q I have committed sin, but I will do it no longer.'
\q
\v 33 Do you think that God will punish that person's sin, since you dislike what God does?
\q You must choose, not I.
\q So say what it is that you know.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Elihu continues speaking.

  * **teach me what I cannot see** - Here to "see" means to know. AT: "teach me what I have done wrong that I am not aware of" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Do you think that God will punish that person's sin, since you dislike what God does?** - "Since you dislike what God does, do you think that God should punish this person's sin?" Elihu uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that he should not think that God will not punish this man. This can be written as a statement. AT: "Even though you do not like what God does, surely even you do not think that God will punish this person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **that person's sin** - Here punishing the person because of his sin is referred to as punished the "person's sin." AT: "that person because of his sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **since you dislike** - "because you dislike"
  * **what it is that you know** - "what you are thinking about this" (UDB)
