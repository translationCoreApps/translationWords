== Governmental leaders ==
This narrative contains many different government officials with different levels of power or influence over the charges brought against Paul. Translating the various titles will be difficult to correspond to the translators's cultural background.

== Implicit knowledge ==
The statement, "Go away for the present, but when I have time again, I will call you" implies the governor was too busy to make a decision about the case against Paul. The reader should understand that this is a weak excuse. The author explains that the governor hoped Paul was wealthy and could bribe his way out of prison. It took the governor two years to decide the outcome of the charges against Paul. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
