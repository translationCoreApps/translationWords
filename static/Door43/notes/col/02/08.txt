====== Colossians 02:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Make sure that no one forces you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* to become his disciples \f + \ft metaphor \f* by his teaching you a religious philosophy\f + \ft Or: doctrine \f* that is valueless and false. Such a philosophy is false because it teaches what mere human beings think, because it teaches people elementary regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* \add that are concerned merely with what is external\f + \ft Or: physical \f*\add*, and because it teaches what is contrary to \add the true teaching about\add* Christ.
\v 9 \add Make sure of this\add*, because it is in Christ's body that God lives completely.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Do not believe anyone who says that you must obey what people have taught about how to honor God or that you must obey what they worship in this world. Instead, obey Christ,
\v 9 because the man Jesus Christ is fully God.

\v 8 See that no one captures you through the philosophy and the empty deceit according to the tradition of men, conforming to the elements of the world, and not conforming to Christ.
\v 9 For in him lives all the fullness of God bodily.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul urges the believers to be careful not to turn to the words and rules of others because nothing can add to the fullness of God that believers have in Christ.

  * **See that** - "Make sure that"
  * **captures you** - Paul speaks of the way a person can believe false teachings (because they believe false things or love the wrong things) as if someone had physically caught and held that person by force. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **philosophy** - religious doctrines and beliefs that are not from God's word but are based on man's thoughts about God and life
  * **empty deceit** - Paul speaks of false ideas that produce nothing and so are without value as though they are containers with nothing in them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the tradition of men ... the elements of the world** - Both Jewish traditions and pagan (Gentile) belief systems are worthless. "The elements of the world" perhaps refers to evil spirits that claimed to rule the world and that were adored by people. But some interpreters view "the elements of the world" as people's basic teachings about the world.
  * **in him lives all the fullness of God bodily** - "God's total nature lives in physical form in Christ"
