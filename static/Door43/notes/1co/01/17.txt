===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Christ sent me not \add primarily\add* to baptize people but to preach the good message about him. When I do that, he does not want me to use words that human philosophers \add consider\add* wise \f + \ft irony \f*. I do not want the message about \add what\add* he \add accomplished when he was nailed to\add* the cross \f + \ft metonymy \f* to lose its power.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 The most important work Christ sent me to do was to tell everyone the good news about him, not to baptize people. I did not proclaim the good news using human wisdom or clever words so instead I could use the power of the work of Christ dying on the cross.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel. He did not send me to preach with words of human wisdom, so that the cross of Christ should not be emptied of its power.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Christ did not send me to baptize** - This means that baptism was not the primary goal of Paul's ministry.
  * **words of human wisdom ... the cross of Christ should not be emptied of its power** - Paul speaks of "words of human wisdom" as if they were people, the cross as a container, and of power as a physical thing that Jesus can put in that container. This can be stated in active form. AT: "words of human wisdom ... those words of human wisdom should not empty the cross of Christ of its power" or "words of human wisdom ... people should not stop believing the message about Jesus and start thinking I am more important than Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
