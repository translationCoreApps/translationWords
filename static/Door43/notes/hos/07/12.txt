===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking.

  * **I will spread my net over them** - This is a way to catch birds. Yahweh continues to compare the people of Israel to doves. When they go to Egypt or Assyria for help, Yahweh will punish them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will bring them down like the birds of the sky** - Yahweh speaks of the way he will judge Israel as if they were birds that he would catch in a net. AT: "I will hunt them like birds" or "I will catch them like a hunter catches birds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **in their flocking together** - This expression extends the metaphor of the birds.
