\v 9 If her master designates her as a wife for his son, he must treat her the same as if she were his daughter. 
\v 10 If he takes another wife for himself, he must not diminish her food, clothing, or her marital rights.
\v 11 But if he does not provide these three things for her, then she can go free without paying any money.
