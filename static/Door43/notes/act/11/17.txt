\v 17 Then if God gave to them the same gift as he gave to us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could oppose God?"
\v 18 When they heard these things, they said nothing in response, but they praised God and said, "Then God has given repentance for life to the Gentiles also."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter finishes his speech  (which he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:11:04|11:4]]) to the Jews about his vision and about what had happened at the house of Cornelius.
  * **General Information:** - The word "them" refers to Cornelius and his Gentile guests and household. Peter does not call them Gentiles in his account to the Jewish believers at Jerusalem.
  * **General Information:** - The word "they" refers to the Jewish believers to whom Peter spoke. The word "us" includes all of the Jewish believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])

  * **Then if God gave to them ... who was I, that I could oppose God?** - Peter uses this question to emphasize that he was only obeying God. AT: "Since God gave to them ... I decided that I could not oppose God!"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the same gift** - Peter refers to the gift of the Holy Spirit.
  * **they said nothing in response** - "they stopped criticizing Peter"
