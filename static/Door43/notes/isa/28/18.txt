====== Isaiah 28:18-19 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 I will annul\f + \ft Or: destroy \f* the agreement that you made \add with the leaders of Egypt\add*.
\q2 You thought that \add because of that agreement\add* you would not be killed and you would not go to the place where the dead are.
\q1 But when the vast \add army of Assyria\add* overwhelms you like a flood,
\q2 they will trample you into the ground.
\q1
\v 19 Their soldiers will come during the morning, at noontime, and at night,
\q2 and they will carry you all away."
\b
\q1 And when you understand this message,
\q2 you will be terrified.
\q1
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 I will cancel the covenant that you made with death,
\q2 and I will bring to an end the covenant you made with the place where the dead dwell. 
\q1 But when the vast flood comes, it will pour over you; 
\q2 and day after day it will pass over you.

\q1
\v 19 When the flood comes, it will pass through and over you like the river when it overflows its banks and causes flooding everywhere. 
\q1 When you finally understand the message of Yahweh, it will cause you to be terrified, not comforted.


\q1
For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on, and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 18 Your covenant with death will be dissolved, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand.
\q1 When the raging flood passes through, you will be overwhelmed by it.
\q1
\v 19 Whenever it passes through, it will overwhelm you,
\q1 and morning by morning it will pass through and by day and night it will come.
\q1 When the message is understood, it will cause terror.
