===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter continues to quote the prophet Joel.

  * **my servants and my female servants** - "both my male and my female servants." These words emphasize that God will pour out his Spirit on all of his servants, both men and women.
  * **I will pour out my Spirit** - Here the words "pour out" mean to give generously and abundantly. AT: "I will give my Spirit abundantly to all people." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:act:02:16|2:17]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **vapor of smoke** - "thick smoke" or "clouds of smoke"
