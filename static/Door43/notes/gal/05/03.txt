====== Galatians 05:3-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Instead, I solemnly declare again to every man who is circumcised \f + \ft Or:has someone circumcise him \f* \add in order for God to accept him\add*, that you must \add perfectly\add* obey all of the laws \add that God gave Moses, in order for God to save you\add*.
\v 4 Those of you who are sure that God will erase the record of your sins because you obey the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add*, you have separated yourselves from Christ. You have abandoned\f + \ft Or: rejected \f* \add God's true method of saving you, which was\add* by kindly erasing the record of your sins, in a way that you did not deserve.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Once again I solemnly declare to every man whom they have circumcised, that he must obey the law perfectly, for God to declare him good in his sight.
\v 4 If you expect God to declare you good in his sight because you try to keep the law, you have separated yourself from Christ; God will no longer act kindly toward you.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 I testify again to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.
\v 4 You are cut off from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you no longer experience grace.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **testify** - "declare" or "serve as a witness"
  * **to every man who lets himself be circumcised** - Paul is using circumcision as a metonym for being Jewish. AT: "to every person who has become a Jew" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **obligated** - "bound" or "constrained" or "enslaved"
  * **You are cut off from Christ** - "You have ended your relationship with Christ"
  * **you who would be justified by the law** - Paul is speaking ironically here. He actually teaches that no Jew can be justified by trying to do the deeds required by the law. AT: "all you who think you can be justified by doing the deeds required by the law" or "you who want to be justified by the law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **you no longer experience grace** - Who that grace comes from can be stated clearly. AT: "God will not be gracious to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
