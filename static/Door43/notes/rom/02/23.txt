===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You who proudly rejoice in the law, do you dishonor God through your transgression of the law?** - Paul uses a question to scold his listener. You can translate this as a strong statement. AT: "It is wicked that you claim to be proud of the law, while at the same time you disobey it and bring shame to God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the name of God is dishonored among the Gentiles** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "Your wicked actions bring shame to God in the minds of the Gentiles" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **name of God** - The word "name" is a metonym that refers to the entirety of God, not just his name. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
