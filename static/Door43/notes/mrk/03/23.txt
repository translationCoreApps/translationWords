\v 23 Jesus summoned those men. \add Then he spoke to them\add* in parables \add to enable them to realize that Satan would not oppose his own evil spirits. He also wanted them to realize that by expelling evil spirits, he was demonstrating that he was much more powerful than Satan\add*. So he said, "\add It is ridiculous\add* to suggest that Satan would expel his own \add evil spirits\add*!\f + \ft Or: Why would Satan expel his own \add evil spirits\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 24 If \add people who live in the same\add* country are fighting one another, they will cease to be a single group under one ruler.
\v 25 And if \add people who live in the same\add* house fight each other, they will certainly not remain \add as one family\add*.
