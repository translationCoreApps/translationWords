===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Christ gave some to be apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers.
\v 12 He gave these offices to equip his holy people for the work of service, for the building up of the body of Christ.
\v 13 He continues to build up his body until we all reach the unity of faith and knowledge of the Son of God, and that we become mature and so reach the measure of the fullness of Christ.
