===== translationNotes: =====

  * **These were the ancestors** - This refers back to the list in the previous verses. However, some versions regard these names as standing in a father-son relationship. In the same way, some versions regard Penuel as the father of Gedor, instead of as the originator of the clan of Gedor.
  * **Etam ... Gedor ... Hushah** - These are names of cities. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Ishma ... Idbash ... Penuel ... Ezer ... Ephrathah** - These are the names of men.
  * **Hazzelelponi** - This is the name of a woman.
  * **These were descendants of Hur** - "Penuel and Ezer were descendants of Hur." This points forward to the list that will follow.
