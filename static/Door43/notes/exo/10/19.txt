===== translationNotes: =====

  * **picked up the locusts** - "moved the locusts upwards"
  * **Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart** - Here "heart" refers to Pharaoh. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart was hard. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:09:11|9:12]]. AT: "caused Pharaoh to became more defiant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
