  * **that righteous man** - This refers to Lot.
  * **was tormented in his righteous soul** - Here the word "soul" refers to Lot's thoughts and emotions. The immoral behavior of the citizens of Sodom and Gomorrah disturbed him emotionally. AT: "was greatly disturbed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
