====== Philippians 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

It was possible at this time to begin an informal letter from a religious leader with a prayer. This is how Paul begins this letter. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The day of Christ ==
This is probably a reference to the day when Christ returns. It was common for Paul to connect the return of Christ with motivation for godly living. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:godly]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== The use of paradox ==

This is a seemingly absurd statement, which appears to contradict itself. A paradox occurs in this chapter: Paul rejoices in his suffering. This is a counter-intuitive reaction to difficulties. Paul's statement, "to die is gain" is another apparent paradox.
