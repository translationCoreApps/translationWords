<usfm>
\v 15 Then a large group of the people who had started to live in northern Egypt and southern Egypt, including all the men who knew that their wives had been burning incense to other gods, and all the women who were standing there, said this to me:
\v 16 "You are saying that \f + \ft metonymy \f* Yahweh gave messages to you, but we will not pay any attention to your messages!
\v 17 We will certainly do everything that we said that we would do. We will burn incense to \add worship our goddess Astarte\add*, the Queen of Heaven, and we will pour out offerings \add of wine\add* to her, just like we and our ancestors and our kings and their officials have always done in the streets of Jerusalem and in the other towns in Judah. At that time, we had plenty of food, and we were prosperous and we did not have any troubles.

At that time, we had plenty of food, and we were prosperous and we did not have any troubles.

\v 15 Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, and all the women who were in the great assembly, and all the people who were living in the land of Egypt in Pathros answered Jeremiah.
\v 16 They said, "About the word that you have told us in Yahweh's name—we will not listen to you.
\v 17 For we will certainly do all the things that we said we would do—burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and pour out drink offerings to her just as we, our ancestors, our kings, and our leaders did in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. Then we will be filled with food and will prosper, without experiencing any disaster.
