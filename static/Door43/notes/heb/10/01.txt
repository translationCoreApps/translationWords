====== Hebrews 10:1-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Just like a shadow vaguely represents the thing that it is a shadow of, the laws that God \add gave Moses\add* only poorly represent \f + \ft metaphor \f* the good things that were to come later. Those laws were not all the good things themselves that God has promised. So, by offering the same kinds of sacrifices every year, people \f + \ft personification \f* who approach God can never become perfect\f + \ft Or: all that God intends them to be \f*.
\v 2 If God had removed the guilt for having sinned of those who brought the sacrifices, they would not feel that they were still guilty. So they would certainly have stopped offering those sacrifices!\f + \ft Or: would they not have stopped offering those sacrifices? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 3 But rather, the fact that they offer those sacrifices each year reminds them that they are still guilty for their sins.
\v 4 The principle is that blood of animals such as bulls or goats can never remove the guilt of those who have sinned.

\v 1 The law does not show very well the good things that God will give us later. The law is like a shadow of something else. If people come to worship God by offering the same kinds of sacrifices every year, they can never become perfect.
\v 2 If God had removed the guilt of those who brought these sacrifices, they would not feel that they were still guilty. So they would certainly have stopped offering those sacrifices!
\v 3 But rather, the fact that they offer those sacrifices each year reminds them that they are still guilty for their sins.
\v 4 So we know that even if we offer animals such as bulls or goats to God, even if he sees their blood flow, that will not stop us from being guilty.

\v 1 For the law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not the real forms of those things themselves. Those who approach God can never be made perfect by the same sacrifices that the priests continually bring year after year.
\v 2 Or else would not those sacrifices have ceased to be offered? In that case, if they had been cleansed once and for all, the worshipers would have no longer been aware of sin.
\v 3 But with those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year.
\v 4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The writer shows the weakness of the law and its sacrifices, why God gave the law, and the perfection of the new priesthood and Christ's sacrifice.

  * **the law is only a shadow of the good things to come** - This speaks about the law as if it were a shadow. The author means the law was not the good things that God had promised. It only hinted at the good things that God was going to do. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **not the real forms of those things themselves** - "not the real things themselves"
  * **year after year** - "every year"
  * **would not those sacrifices have ceased to be offered?** - The author uses a question to state that the sacrifices were limited in their power. This can be stated in active form. AT: "they would have ceased offering those sacrifices." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **ceased** - "stopped"
  * **In that case** - "In that situation"
  * **if they had been cleansed** - People's sins are spoken of as if they could be physically washed away. This can be stated in active form. AT: "if God had already forgiven their sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **no longer been aware** - "would have known that they were no longer guilty of sin"
  * **For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins** - Sins are spoken of as if they were objects that animal blood could sweep away as it flowed. AT: "For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to cause God to forgive sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the blood of bulls and goats** - Here "blood" refers to these animals dying as sacrifices to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
