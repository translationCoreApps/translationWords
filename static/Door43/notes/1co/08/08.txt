====== 1 Corinthians 08:8-10 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 But God will not think more highly about us \add if we eat certain\add* foods, or if we do not eat \add certain foods\add*. That is, we are not more acceptable to God if we do not eat certain foods, nor are we more acceptable to him if we eat those foods.
\v 9 However, be sure that you do not do anything that God allows you to do, if by doing that you would encourage any of \add your fellow believers to do something that\add* they are not sure \add God allows them to do\add*. As a result, you would be causing them to sin.
\v 10 For example, you know \add that idols are not really alive\add*. Suppose that in a temple \add where they worship\add* idols you eat \add food that has been sacrificed to idols\add*. Suppose that someone who is not sure whether God allows us to eat that food sees you eating it. \add You\add* would be encouraging him to eat it, too.\f + \ft Or: Wouldn't \add you\add* be encouraging him to eat it, too? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 We know that the food we eat does not make us better or worse before God.
\v 9 But what is important is your brothers and sisters in Christ. You are free to eat that food, but you should not cause people to fall down in their faith because you have the freedom to eat it.
\v 10 You know that idols were never alive, nor were they gods at all. But if brothers and sisters who do not know the difference between right and wrong see you eating in an idol's temple, they would think you were encouraging them to turn back to their idolatry.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 But food will not present us to God. We are not worse if we do not eat, nor better if we do eat it.
\v 9 But take care that your freedom does not become a reason for someone who is weak in faith to stumble.
\v 10 For suppose that someone sees you, who have knowledge, eating a meal in an idol's temple. Is not his weak conscience emboldened to eat what is offered to idols?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **food will not present us to God** - Paul speaks of food as though it were a person who could make God welcome us. AT: "food does not give us favor with God" or "the food we eat does not make God pleased with us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **We are not worse if we do not eat, nor better if we do eat it** - "Some people might think that if we do not eat some things, God will love us less. But they are wrong. Those who think that God will love us more if we do eat those things are also wrong" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **someone who is weak** - believers not strong in their faith
  * **sees you, who have** - Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so these words are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **his ... conscience** - what he understands to be right and wrong
  * **emboldened to eat** - "encouraged to eat"
