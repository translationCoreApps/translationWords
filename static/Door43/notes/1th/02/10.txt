<usfm>
\v 10 Both you and God know that we lived toward you believers in a very good and right wayâ€”in a way that no one could criticize.
\v 11 You know also that we behaved toward each one of you as a father who loves his children behaves toward them.
\v 12 We kept strongly exhorting and encouraging you to live like God's people should, because he has called you to become his people to whom he will show himself as king with the most wonderful power.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 You are witnesses, and God also, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe.
\v 11 In the same way, you know how with each one of you, as a father with his own children, we exhorted and encouraged you. We testified
\v 12 that you should walk in a manner that is worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.
