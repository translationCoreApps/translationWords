\v 27 Do not forget what you promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Ignore how stubborn and wicked these people have been, and the sin that they have committed.
\v 28 If you do not do that, and if you destroy them, the people of Egypt will hear about it and say that you were not able to bring them into the land that you promised to give to them. They will say that you took them into the desert only to kill them there because you hated them.
\v 29 Do not forget that they are your people. You chose them to belong to you. You brought them out from Egypt by your very great power.'"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 Call to mind your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look at the stubbornness of this people, nor at their wickedness, nor at their sin,
\v 28 so that the land from where you brought us should say, "Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land that he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness."
\v 29 Yet they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out by your great strength and by the display of your power.'
