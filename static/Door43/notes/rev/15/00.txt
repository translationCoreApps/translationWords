====== Revelation 15 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 15:3-4, which is a quotation of the song the angels were singing.

The events and pictures described in this chapter occur in heaven.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "The most holy place, in which was the tent of witness, was open in heaven" ==
This statement has led some scholars to believe the Jewish temple reflected a scene in heaven. (See:[[:en:obe:kt:heaven]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_apocalypticwriting]]) 

== Songs ==

Heaven is often described as a place where people sing. These are songs of worship to God. This illustrates that heaven is place where God is continually worshiped.
