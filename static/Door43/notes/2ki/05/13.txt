\v 13 But his servants came to him, and one of them said, "Sir, if that prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would certainly have done it. So why do you refuse to do such a simple thing he asks, when he says, "Go down seven times in the water and be clean?'"
\v 14 So Naaman went down to the Jordan River and went into the water seven times, as the prophet had instructed, and his skin became healthy, like the smooth skin of a young child.

\v 13 Then Naaman's servants came near and spoke to him, "My father, if the prophet had commanded you do some difficult thing, would you not have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you to simply, 'Dip yourself and be clean?'"
\v 14 Then he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, obeying the instructions of the man of God. His flesh was restored again like the flesh of a little child, and he was healed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **My father** - The servants were showing respect to Naaman by addressing him as "my father" or "sir."
  * **would you not have done it?** - The servant uses this question to carefully rebuke Naaman. AT: "you surely would have done it!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **How much rather then** - The servant is comparing how much more willing Naaman should be to obey a simple command since he is willing to obey a difficult one. AT: "How much more willing you should be to obey" or "Should you not be even more willing to obey" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **How much rather then, when he says to you to simply, 'Dip yourself and be clean?** - The servant uses this rhetorical question to emphasize to Naaman that he should obey Elisha's command. This question can be written as statement. AT: "You should be even more willing to obey when he says to you simply, 'Dip yourself and be clean.'" [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the man of God** - "Elisha, the man of God" 
  * **His flesh was restored again like the flesh of a little child** - This speaks how smooth Namaan's skin is after he is healed by comparing it to the skin of a young child. AT: "His flesh was restored again and was as soft as the flesh of a young child" or "His skin was well again and was smooth like a young child's skin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **His flesh** - "His skin" 
  * **he was healed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "his leprosy was gone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
