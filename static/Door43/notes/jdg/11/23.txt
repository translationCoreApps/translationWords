\v 23 It was Yahweh, the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, who forced the Amor people-group to leave as the Israelites advanced. So do you now think that you can force the Israelites to leave \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\v 24 You take the land that your god Chemosh has given to you. And we will live in the land that Yahweh our God has given to us!
\v 25 Are you better than Zippor's son Balak, who was the king of the Moab people-group? He never \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* quarreled with the Israelite people, and he never started to fight against us \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!

\v 23 It was Yahweh, the God of Israel, who forced the Amorites to leave the places where they lived, as the Israelites advanced. So do you now think that you can now take possession of their land?
\v 24 You have the right to the land when Chemosh gives it to you. And we will live in the land that Yahweh our God has given to us!
\v 25 Are you better than Balak son of Zippor, the king of the Moab? He never dared to fight against Israel!

<usfm>
\v 23 So then Yahweh, the God of Israel, has driven out the Amorites before his people Israel, and should you now take possession of their land?
\v 24 Will you not take over the land that Chemosh, your god, gives you? So whatever land Yahweh our God has given us, we will take over.
\v 25 Now are you really better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he dare to have an argument with Israel? Did he ever wage war against them?
