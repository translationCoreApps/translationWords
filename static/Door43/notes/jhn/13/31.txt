\v 32 Since by what I do people will see how awesome God is, God himself will show people how awesome I am. And he will do that very soon.
\p
\v 33 \add You whom I love as though you were\add* my children, I will continue with you only a short time longer. Then you will look for me, but I will not be here.

\v 31 After Judas left, Jesus said, "Now God will make people know what I, the Son of Man, am doing. I, the Son of Man, will make people know what God is doing as well, and people will praise him for it.
\v 32 Since I, the Son of Man, make God known to people and since I honor him, God will also honor me. God will do this immediately.
\p
\v 33 Little children, I am with you just a little while longer. You will look for me; but, just as I told the Jews, and as I am now telling you, where I am going, you cannot come.

\v 31 When Judas was gone, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.
\v 32 God will glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately.
\v 33 Little children, I am with you for still a short amount of time. You will look for me, and as I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going, you cannot come.' Now I also say this to you.
