===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus tells a parable about wise and foolish virgins to illustrate that his disciples should be prepared for his return. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **the kingdom of heaven will be like** - Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used only in Matthew. If possible, use "heaven" in your translation. AT: "when our God in heaven shows himself to be king, it will be like." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:24|13:24]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **lamps** - These could have been 1) lamps or 2) torches made by putting cloth around the end of a stick and wetting the cloth with oil.
  * **Five of them** - "Five of the virgins"
  * **did not take any oil with them** - "had with them only the oil in their lamps"
