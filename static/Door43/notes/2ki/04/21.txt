  * **on the bed of the man of God** - This was the bed in the room she had prepared for Elisha when he traveled through Shunem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the man of God** - "Elisha, the man of God"
  * **that I may hurry to the man of God and then come back** - The woman told her husband she was going to see Elisha but she did not say that she was going because their son had died.
