  * **the descendants of Merari** - This refers only to men. AT: "the male descendants of Merari" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Merari** - Translate this man's name the same way that you did in [[:en:bible:notes:num:03:17|3:17]].
  * **order them** - "list them"
  * **thirty years old ... fifty years old** - "30 years old ... 50 years old" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **join the company and serve in the tent of meeting** - The word "company" refers to the rest of the people working in the tent of meeting. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:num:04:01|4:3]].
