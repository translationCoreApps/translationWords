===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They said to each another** - This refers to the people of Israel.
  * **lay facedown** - "lay down with their faces touching the ground." Moses and Aaron did this to show that they were humbling themselves before God. They feared that God might punish the people for rebelling against him. AT: "lay facedown in humility to God" or "lay facedown to pray to God"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
