\v 8 Abner became very angry about what Ishbosheth said to him. He said to Ishbosheth, "Do you think that I am a worthless dog from Judah? From the beginning I have been loyal to Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends. And I have kept David's army from defeating you. So now why are you criticizing me about what I have done with some woman?

\v 8 Then Abner was very angry at the words of Ishbosheth and said, "Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? Today I am showing faithfulness to the house of Saul, your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, by not delivering you into the hand of David. But now you accuse me of an offense concerning this woman?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah?** - This question is used by Abner as an angry denial of Ishbosheth's accusation. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "I am not a traitor working for David!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah?** - Abner speaks of himself as the head of a dog, which the Israelites considered to be loyal to anyone who fed them. Here "belongs to Judah" implies that Abner's loyalty is to Judah, to which David belonged, and not to Saul's house. AT: "Am I a traitor for Judah?" or "I am not a traitor working for David!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **into the hand of David** - Here "hand" represents the power to defeat. AT: "to be defeated by David" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **But now you accuse me of an offense concerning this woman?** - Abner asks this question to rebuke Ishbosheth. It is unclear if Abner actually slept with Rizpah, or if he was falsely accused. Possible meanings are 1) Abner was guilty. AT: "You should not be upset that I slept with this woman!" or 2) Abner was not guilty. AT: "You should not think that I have slept with this woman!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
