\v 12 I am writing this to you whom I love as though you were my own children. God has forgiven your sins because of what Christ has done for you.
\v 13 I am writing to you believers who are older than the others. You have known Christ, who has always lived. I am also writing to you young men; you have defeated Satan, the evil one. And I am writing to you little children, because you know God the Father.
\v 14 I will say it again: I am writing this to you older men because you have come to know Christ, the one who has always existed. And I am writing to you young men, because you are strong and you continue to obey what God commands, and because you have defeated Satan, the evil one.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - John explains why he is writing his letter to either different age groups or to believers with differences in maturity. Try to use similar wording for these sentences, as they are written poetically.

  * **dear children** - John was an elderly man and their leader. He used this expression to show his love for them. AT: "my dear children in Christ" or "you who are as dear to me as my own children." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:02:01|2:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your sins are forgiven** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God forgives your sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **because of his name** - "his name" refers to Christ and who he is. AT: "because of what Christ has done for you" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I am writing to you, fathers** - The word "fathers" here is possibly a metaphor referring to mature believers. AT: "I am writing to you, mature believers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you know** - "you have a relationship with"
  * **the one who is from the beginning** - "the one who has always lived" or "the one who has always existed." It refers either to "Jesus" or to "God the Father." 
  * **young men** - This possibly refers to those who are no longer new believers but are growing in spiritual maturity. AT: "young believers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you are strong** - Here "strong" refers not to believers' physical strength, but to their faithfulness to Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **the word of God remains in you** - The writer refers to the believers' increased faithfulness to Christ and knowledge of him as if he were speaking of God's word existing in them. AT: "you know the word of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **overcome** - The writer is speaking of the believers' refusal to follow Satan and of their frustrating his plans as if it were a matter of conquering him. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
