====== Luke 22 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The events of this chapter are commonly referred to as the "last supper." This Passover feast in many ways parallels Jesus' sacrifice as the lamb of God.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The eating of the body and blood ==

To this day, this symbolic action is practiced in nearly all churches to this day in remembrance of Christ's sacrifice for the sins of man. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

== The New Covenant ==
Jesus mentions the New Covenant during the last supper. The New Covenant is a source of controversy among scholars. There are many different opinions about when this covenant begins and the church's relationship to the new covenant. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:newcovenant]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Son of Man ==

Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man." Every language may not have the ability to have a person refer to himself (the first person) in the third person.

== "this is your hour" ==
In many cultures, there is a belief that only bad things happen in the middle of the night, when the good people are asleep. This phrase is an insult that the people arresting Jesus are doing evil. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:evil]])
