  * **no women were found as beautiful as Job's daughters** - "Job's daughters were more beautiful than all the other women"
  * **being old and full of days** - The words "full of days" means basically the same thing as "being old." The two phrases form a common idiom. AT: "a very old man." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
