<usfm>
\v 4 Listen because Yahweh has told me this:
\q1 "I will watch quietly from where I live.
\q2 I will watch as quietly as \f + \ft simile \f* the heat that shimmers as it rises on a days during the summer\f + \ft Or: hot season \f*,
\q2 as quietly as the dew forms \add on the ground\add* during harvest time."
\q1
\v 5 But even before the army of Ethiopia starts to attack,
\q2 while their plans are \add slowly forming\add* like \f + \ft simile \f* grapes that are ripening,
\q1 Yahweh will \add get rid of them like a farmer who\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* cuts off the new shoots of the grapevines with his shears,
\q2 and prunes the branches that have become very long.
\q1

\v 4 Listen because Yahweh has told me this:
\q2 "I will watch quietly from where I live.
\q1 I will watch quietly like the heat that shimmers as it rises on a summer day.
\q2 I will work effectively like the cloud of mist that settles during the heat of harvest.
\v 5 Before the harvest, the farmer sees the grapevines making blossoms and the flowers growing into grapes, 
\q2 and he knows that the time is right to cut off the new growth and spreading branches that keep the tree from growing strong.
\q1 In the same way I know when the time is right to take action against that nation, and I will send an army to attack it.

\v 4 This is what Yahweh said to me, "I will quietly observe from my home,
\q1 like the simmering heat in sunshine, like a cloud of mist in the heat of harvest.
\q1
\v 5 Before the harvest, when the blossoming is over, and the flower is ripening into a grape,
\q1 he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches.
