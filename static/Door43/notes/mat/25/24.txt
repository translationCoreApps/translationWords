\v 24 Then the servant who had received one thousand dollars came. He said, 'Boss, I \add was afraid of you\add*. I knew that you are a man who does not do foolish things with his money. \add You even\add* take\add from others money\add* that does not really belong to you\add , like a farmer who\add* harvests \add grain from another man's field\add* where he did not even plant \add the seeds\add*.
\v 25 So because I was afraid \add of what you would do to me if I did not make a profit from my business\add*, I went out and hid your thousand dollars in the ground \add to keep it safe\add*. Here, this is \add the money\add* that belongs to you!'

\v 24 Then the servant who had received one bag of gold came. He said, 'Master, I was afraid of you. I knew that you are a man who expects to make a lot of money even if you invest nothing, like a farmer who tries to harvest a field he did not plant.
\v 25 I was afraid of what you might do if I lost the money you lent me to invest, so I hid it in the ground. Here it is now; please take it back!'

\v 24 Then the servant who had received one talent came and said, 'Master, I know that you are a strict man. You reap where you did not sow, and you harvest where you did not scatter.
\v 25 I was afraid, so I went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have here what belongs to you.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues telling the parable about the servants and the talents. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]])

  * **You reap where you did not sow, and you harvest where you did not scatter** - These two statements mean the same thing. They refer to a farmer who gathers crops that do not belong to him. The servant uses this metaphor to accuse the master of being a ruthless businessman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **scatter** - In those days they often threw small amounts of seed around instead of planting in rows.
  * **See, you have here what belongs to you** - "Look, here is what is yours"
