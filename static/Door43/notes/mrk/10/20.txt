You must go \add home\add*, sell all that you possess, and then give \add the money\add* to poor people. \add As a result\add*, you will be spiritually rich in heaven. After \add you have done what I have told you\add*, come with me \add and be my disciple\add*!"

\v 20 The man said, "Teacher, all these things I have obeyed from the time I was a youth."
\v 21 Jesus looked at him and loved him. He said to him, "One thing you lack. You must sell all that you have and give it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
\v 22 But he became discouraged because of this statement; he walked away being very sorrowful, for he had many possessions.
