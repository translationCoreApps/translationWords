====== Romans 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter begins by answering a possible or hypothetical objection to Paul's teaching in chapter 5. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]]) 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Against the Law ==
This chapter refutes the teaching that Christians can live however they want after they have received salvation. Scholars call this teaching antinomianism or being "against the law" because people are attempting to live without any type of rules in their life. Paul recalls the great price Jesus paid for a Christian's salvation as motivation for godly living. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:save]] and [[:en:obe:kt:godly]])

== Servants of sin ==
Before coming to faith in Jesus, people are servants or slaves of sin. After salvation, a Christian is freed from this bondage and is able to choose to serve Christ in their life. Paul explains that when a Christian chooses to sin, it is because the person has willingly chosen sin. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:faith]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

== Fruit ==
The imagery of fruit is used in this chapter. The image of fruit usually refers to faith producing acts of righteousness in a person's life. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fruit]] and [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
These are frequently used in this chapter. It appears the intent of these rhetorical questions is to make the reader feel guilty, or to convict them of their sin and ultimately bring them to faith in Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], [[:en:obe:kt:guilt]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Death ==
Death is used many different ways in this chapter. Physical death, spiritual death, the reign of sin in the heart of man and to put an end to something. Sin and death are supposed to contrast the new life provided by Christ and the new way a Christian is supposed to live after they receive salvation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:death]])
