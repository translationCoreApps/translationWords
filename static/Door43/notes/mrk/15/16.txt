===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the courtyard (that of the barracks)** - "the courtyard of the barracks" (UDB). The barracks is the place where the soldiers stayed.
  * **the whole cohort of soldiers** - "all of the soldiers who were on duty"
  * **They put a purple robe on Jesus** - This was an act of mockery. Purple was a color worn by royalty and by clothing him this way they were mocking his title, King of the Jews, which is ironic because he is indeed a king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **a crown of thorns** - "a crown made of thorny branches"
  * **Hail, King of the Jews** - The greeting "Hail" with a raised hand was only used to greet Caesar. As the soldiers used the crown of thorns and the purple robe to mock Jesus, it is ironic that they do not recognize that he is indeed a king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
