\q
\v 9 What are you people plotting against Yahweh? 
\q He will make a full end to it; trouble will not rise up a second time.
\q
\v 10 For they will become tangled up like thornbushes; they will be saturated in their own drink; 
\q they will be completely devoured by fire like dry stubble.
\q
\v 11 Someone arose among you, Nineveh, who planned evil against Yahweh, someone who promoted wickedness.
