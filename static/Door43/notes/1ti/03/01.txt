<usfm>
\v 1 Anyone who aspires to be an elder  \add in the congregation\add* \f + \ft Or: a bishop \f* desires a noble\f + \ft Or: honorable \f* task.
\v 2  \add Since that is a task that others should respect\add*, an overseer must  \add conduct himself\add* in such a way that  \add no one\add* can truly say that he has done  \add anything that is\add* wrong\f + \ft Or: find fault with him \f*. Specifically, \add he must be\add* faithful to his wife. He must think clearly  \add about what he does\add*. He must be able to control his behavior. He must be sensible. He must be dignified, Or: respectable. He must welcome and care for guests. He must be able to teach  \add God's truth\add* well.
\v 3 He must not be a drunkard. He must not be ready\f + \ft Or: quick \f* to fight  \add those who make him angry\add*. On the contrary, he must be gentle and he must not be quarrelsome. He must not be greedy for much money.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 You should rely on what I tell you here: If someone desires very much to oversee believers, he wants to do something really excellent.
\v 2 For that reason, however, an overseer must be someone whom no one accuses of anything bad. He must have only one wife. He must not do anything to excess; he must think in wise ways. He must behave well, and he must welcome strangers. He must be able to teach others.
\v 3 He must not be an alcoholic and not quick to fight. Instead, he must be patient and peaceful with others. And he should not be greedy for money.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\c 3
\p
\v 1 This saying is trustworthy: If someone desires to be an overseer, he desires a good work.
\v 2 Therefore the overseer must be without reproach. He must be a husband of one wife. He must be moderate, sensible, orderly, hospitable. He must be able to teach.
\v 3 He must not be addicted to wine, not a brawler, but instead, gentle, peaceful. He must not be a lover of money.
