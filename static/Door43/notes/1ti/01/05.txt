<usfm>
\v 5 \add Teach them\add* to have pure desires \f + \ft metonymy \f* and \add thus to know within themselves that God\add* approves of what they do, and to sincerely believe \add the true teaching\add*. By doing that, \add they will\add* love \add God well\add*.
\v 6 There are some people who have turned away from these true teachings. As a result, they \add just\add* discuss what is useless.
\v 7 They desire to teach the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add*, but they do not understand what they are really saying nor the things about which they confidently speak\f + \ft Or: say that they understand well \f*.
\p
\v 8 We know that the laws \add that God gave to Moses are\add* good if people consider correctly \add what God intended them for\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Instead, the purpose of what we command you to teach is to love God from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from faith that is sincere.
\v 6 Some men have stopped trying to do these good things; instead, they are now saying useless things.
\v 7 They want to teach about the law, but they do not understand it. Yet they insist that what they teach is true.
\p
\v 8 But we know that law is good if we know how to use it according to what the law says.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Now the goal of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from a sincere faith.
\v 6 Some people have missed the mark and have turned away from these things to foolish talk.
\v 7 They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand what they say or what they insist on.
\v 8 But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main teaching. Here Paul explains the purpose of what he is commanding Timothy.
  * **the commandment** - Here this does not mean the Old Testament or the Ten Commandments but rather the instructions that Paul gives in [[:en:bible:notes:1ti:01:03|1:3-4]].
  * **is love** - Possible meanings are 1) "is to love God" (UDB) or 2) "is to love people."
  * **from a pure heart** - Here "pure" means the person does not have hidden motives to do wrong. Here "heart" refers to a person's mind and thoughts. AT: "from a mind that is honest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **good conscience** - "a conscience that chooses right instead wrong"
  * **sincere faith** - "genuine faith" or "a faith without hypocrisy"
  * **Some people have missed the mark** - Paul speaks of faith in Christ as if it were a target at which to aim. Paul means that some people are not fulfilling the purpose of their faith, which is to love as he just explained in 1:5. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and have turned away from these things** - Here "turned away" is an idiom that means they have stopped doing what God has commanded. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **teachers of the law** - Here "law" refers to the law of Moses.
  * **but they do not understand** - "even though they do not understand" or "and yet they do not understand"
  * **what they insist on** - "what they confidently state is true"
  * **we know that the law is good** - "we understand that the law is useful" or "we understand that the law is beneficial"
  * **if one uses it lawfully** - "if we use it correctly" or "if we use it the way God intended"
