\v 20 Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have indeed obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and have gone on the way that Yahweh sent me. I have captured Agag, the king of Amalek, and have completely destroyed the Amalekites.
\v 21 But the people took some of the bootyâ€”sheep and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I have indeed obeyed the voice of Yahweh** - This is an emphatic statement. It is unclear if Saul thought this was true, or if he was simply making excuses for his sin. 
  * **the voice of Yahweh** - Here "voice" refers to the commands that Yahweh spoke. AT: "the things that Yahweh commanded" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Agag** - This is the name of the king of the Amalekites. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **But the people took** - This appears to be shifting the blame to the people.
  * **things devoted to destruction** - "animals that Yahweh commanded them to destroy"
  * **Gilgal** - This is the name of a place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
