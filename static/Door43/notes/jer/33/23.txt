\v 23 Yahweh gave another message to me. He said,
\v 24 "Surely you know that some people are saying, 'Yahweh chose two groups, the people of Judah and the people of Israel, and later abandoned them.' Thepeople who are saying this are despising my people; they are saying that Israel no longer deserves to be considered a nation.

\v 24 "Have you not considered what this people has declared when they said, 'The two clans that Yahweh chose, now he has rejected them'? In this way they despise my people, saying that they are no longer a nation in their sight.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01|1:2]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **to Jeremiah** - It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. There is no need to translate using first person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Have you not considered what this people has declared when they said, 'The ... them'?** - Yahweh wants Jeremiah to think deeply about what the people have said. AT: "You should have noticed what this people are really saying when they said, 'The ... them.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **In this way they despise my people, saying ... sight** - "What they are really saying is that my people are worthless and that my people will never again be a nation."
  * **my people ... are no longer a nation in their sight** - Sight is a metonym for thinking. AT: "they no longer think of my people as a nation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
