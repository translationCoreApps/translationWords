===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - After the high priest gave Saul the letters, Saul left for Damascus.

  * **As he was traveling** - Saul left Jerusalem and now travels to Damascus.
  * **it happened that** - This is an expression that marks a change in the story to show something different is about to happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])
  * **there shone all around him a light out of heaven** - "a light from heaven shone all around him"
  * **out of heaven** - Possible meanings are 1) heaven, where God lives or 2) the sky. The first meaning is preferable. Use that meaning if your language has a separate word for it.
  * **he fell upon the ground** - Possible meanings are that 1) "Saul threw himself to the ground" or 2) "The light caused him to fall to the ground" or 3) "Saul fell to the ground the way one who fainted fell." Saul did not fall accidentally.
  * **why are you persecuting me?** - This rhetorical question communicates a rebuke to Saul. In some languages a statement would be more natural (AT): "You are persecuting me!" or a command (AT): "Stop persecuting me!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
