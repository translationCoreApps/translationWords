===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Having just reminded the people not to be proud concerning who taught them about the Lord and who had baptized them, Paul reminds the Corinthian believers that all believers are to be humble servants.

  * **In this connection** - "Because we are these stewards"
  * **it is a requirement for stewards that they be** - Paul is speaking of himself as if he were speaking of someone else. AT: "we are required to be" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
