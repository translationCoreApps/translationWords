\v 41 God\add did\add* not \add let\add* all the \add Jewish\add* people see him. Instead, he had chosen us \add apostles\add* beforehand to see \add Jesus after he became alive again\add* and to tell others \add about him\add*. We \add apostles are the people\add* who ate meals with him after he had become alive \add again\add*\f + \ft Or: after he had risen from the dead \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 39 "We all saw the things Jesus did in Jerusalem and around every part of the country of Israel where he lived. His enemies killed him by nailing him to a wooden cross.
\v 40 Then God raised him back to life on the third day after he died, and he made sure that many people would see him alive after he was brought back to life. People were sure it was him who had died, and now they saw with their own eyes, and were fully convinced, that he was alive again.
\v 41 At that time God did not let everyone see him, only those he selected to spend time with him and to eat a meal together in those first days just after God raised him back to life.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 39 We are witnesses of all the things Jesus did, both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree,
\v 40 but God raised him up on the third day and caused him to be seen,
\v 41 not by all the people, but to the witnesses who were chosen beforehand by Godâ€”by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead ones.
