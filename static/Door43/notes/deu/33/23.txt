===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to bless the tribes of Israel; the blessings are short poems. He speaks of the descendants  of Naphtali as if they were one man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **satisfied with favor** - Yahweh being pleased with Naphtali is spoken of as if "favor" were food that Naphtali ate until he was no longer hungry. AT: "who has all the good things he desires because Yahweh is pleased with him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **full of the blessing of Yahweh** - Blessings are spoken of as if they were food that Naphtali ate until he could hold no more. AT: "whom Yahweh has blessed so that he has all he needs"
  * **take possession** - Moses speaks as if the tribe of Naphtali is one man, so these words are singular. [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]
  * **the land to the west and south** - This refers to the land around Lake Galilee. The full meaning of this statement may be made explicit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
