  * **Yahweh has punished me** - "Yahweh has disciplined me"
  * **he has not handed me over to death** - The writer speaks of death as if it were a person under whose power Yahweh could place the writer. AT: "he has not allowed me to die" or "he has not allowed my enemies to kill me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
