\v 1 Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads. On its horns were ten crowns, and on each of its  heads was a blasphemous name.
\v 2 This beast I saw was like a leopard. Its feet were like a bear's feet, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. The dragon gave his power to it, and his throne, and his great authority to rule.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - John begins to describe a beast who appears in his vision. The word "I" here refers to John.

  * **dragon** - This was a large, fierce reptile, like a lizard. For Jewish people, it was a symbol of evil and chaos. The dragon is also identified  as "the devil or Satan." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:12:03|12:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **The dragon gave his power to it** - The dragon made the beast as powerful as he was. He did not lose his power, however, by giving it to the beast.
  * **his power ... his throne, and his great authority to rule** - These are three ways of referring to his authority, and together they emphasize that the authority was great.
  * **his throne** - The word "throne" here refers to the dragon's authority to rule as king. AT: "his royal authority" or "his authority to rule as king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
