===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Lebanon will be turned into a field, and the field will become a forest** - Possible meanings are 1) this is literal and Yahweh will cause the places where trees grew wild in Lebanon to become fruitful fields or 2) this is a metaphor and the large forests of Lebanon represent powerful oppressors, and the crops that grow in the field and become a forest are the common people who are suffering. This means Yahweh will humble those who are powerful, but he will honor those who are suffering. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Lebanon will be turned into a field** - Here "Lebanon" represents the large cedar forests in Lebanon. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will turn the mighty forests of Lebanon into a field" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the deaf will hear the words of a book, and the eyes of the blind will see out of the deep darkness** - Possible meanings are 1) this is literal and Yahweh will cause deaf people to hear and blind people to see or 2) this is a metaphor that means Yahweh will enable the people to hear and understand his message or 3) it may mean both options 1 and 2. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the eyes of the blind** - Here "eyes" represents the whole person. AT: "those who are blind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **The oppressed will again rejoice in Yahweh, and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. AT: "The poor and oppressed people will again be happy because of what Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, has done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
