====== Ephesians 02:8-10 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 It is \add only\add* by \add God\add* acting \f + \ft personification \f* \add toward you\add* in a way that you did not deserve that you have been saved \f + \ft Or:that he has saved you \f* as a result of your trusting \add in Christ\add*. You did not save yourselves. His saving you was his gift to you.
\v 9 He did not save any of you because of anything you yourselves did. The result is that no one can be proud of what they have done \add to save themselves\add*.
\v 10 It is God who has made us what we are now. Because of our relationship with Christ Jesus, he has enabled us to receive \add spiritual\f + \ft Or: eternal \f*\add* life in order that we should conduct our lives habitually doing the good deeds that God previously planned for us to do.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 For God has saved you from his punishment by his extreme kindness given to you because you trust Jesus. You have not saved yourselves; this is a gift from God—
\v 9 a gift that no one can earn, so no one can boast and say that he has saved himself.
\v 10 So God has created us as new people joined to Christ Jesus, so we can do good things—things that God planned long ago for us to do.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this did not come from you, it is the gift of God.
\v 9 Grace is not from works and so no one may boast.
\v 10 For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good deeds that God planned long ago for us, so that we would walk in them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For by grace you have been saved through faith** - God's kindness to us is the reason he made it possible for us to be saved from judgment if we simply trust in Jesus. AT: "God saved you by grace because of your faith in him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **and this did not** - The word "this" refers back to "by grace you have been saved by faith."
  * **not from works** - "this salvation did not come because of good things you have done"
  * **in Christ Jesus** - "In Christ Jesus" and similar expressions are metaphors that frequently occur in the New Testament letters. They express the strongest kind of relationship possible between Christ and those who believe in him.
  * **walk in** - "follow" or "do" (UDB)
