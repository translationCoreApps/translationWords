  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to give Ezekiel a message about what will happen to Israel.

  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **because of their iniquity by which they betrayed me** - The abstract noun "iniquity" can be stated as a verb. AT: "because they sinned and betrayed me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **I hid my face from them** - Here "face" refers to Yahweh's help and protection. AT: "I stopped protecting them and taking care of them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
