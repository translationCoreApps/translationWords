\q
\v 3 Do not drag me away with the wicked, those who do iniquity,
\q who speak peace with their neighbors but have evil in their hearts.
\q
\v 4 Give them what their deeds deserve and repay them what their wickedness demands;
\q repay them for the work of their hands; render to them their due.
\q
\v 5 Because they do not understand the deeds of Yahweh or the work of his hands,
\q he will tear them down and never rebuild them.
\b

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do not drag me away** - God punishing people is spoken of as if he physically drags them away. In this metaphor Yahweh may be dragging them to prison, exile, or death. AT: "Do not remove me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who speak peace with their neighbors** - Here "neighbors" refers to people in general. AT: "who speak peacefully with other people"
  * **but have evil in their hearts** - Here "hearts" represents a person's mind or thoughts. AT: "but are thinking something evil about them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Give them what their deeds deserve ... repay them what their wickedness demands** - These two phrases mean the same thing. They are used together to emphasize that they deserve for God to punish them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the work of their hands** - Here "hands" represent what the person has done. AT: "the things they have done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **render to them their due** - "give them what they deserve"
  * **Because they do not understand ... never rebuild them** - It is unclear if verse 5 is best understood as a statement (as in the ULB) or as a request (as in the UDB).
  * **they do not understand the deeds of Yahweh** - Here "do not understand" means they ignore or do not honor. Also "ways" represents what God has done. AT: "they do not regard with honor what Yahweh has done"
  * **the work of his hands** - Here "hands" represents what Yahweh has done or created. AT: "what he has created" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he will tear them down and never rebuild them** - The punishment of the wicked people is spoken of as if they were a building or a city that would be destroyed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
