===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - While on the island of Paphos, Paul begins to talk to Elymas.
  * **General Information:** - The words "him," "You," and "you" refer to the magician Elymas (also called Bar Jesus). (See: [[:en:bible:notes:act:13:06|13:6-8]])

  * **Saul, who is also called Paul** - "Saul" as his Jewish name, and "Paul" was his Roman name. Since he was speaking to a Roman official, he used his Roman name. AT: "Saul, who now called himself Paul" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **stared at him intensely** - "looked at him intensely"
  * **You son of the devil** - Paul is saying the man is acting like the devil. AT: "You are like the devil" or "You act like the devil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **you are full of all kinds of deceit and wickedness** - "you are always intent in causing others to believe what is not true using falsehood and always doing what is wrong"
  * **wickedness** - In this context it means to be lazy and not diligent in following God's law.
  * **You are an enemy of every kind of righteousness** - Paul is grouping Elymas with the devil. Just as the devil is an enemy of God and is against righteousness, so also was Elymas.
  * **You will never stop twisting the straight paths of the Lord, will you?** - Paul uses this question to rebuke Elymas for opposing God. AT: "You are always saying that the truth about the Lord God is false!" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the straight paths of the Lord** - Here "straight paths" refer to the ways that are true. AT: "the true ways of the Lord" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
