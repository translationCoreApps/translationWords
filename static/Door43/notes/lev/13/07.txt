\v 7 But if the rash has spread in the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he must then show himself to the priest again. 
\v 8 The priest will examine him to see if the rash has spread farther in the skin. If it has spread, then the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an infectious disease.
