\v 18 No good fruit tree produces worthless fruit, and no rotten tree produces good fruit.
\v 19 Workers chop down and burn up all the trees that do not produce good fruit.
\v 20 By seeing what plants produce, you know what kind of plants they are. Similarly, when you see what the people who come to you do, you will know if they truly produce good or not.

\v 19 Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
\v 20 So then, you will recognize them by their fruits.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire** - Jesus continues to use fruit trees as a metaphor to refer to false prophets. Here, he only states what will happen to the bad trees. It is implied that the same thing will happen to the false prophets. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **is cut down and thrown into the fire** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "a person will cut it down and burn it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **you will recognize them by their fruits** - The word "their" can refer to either the prophets or the trees. This metaphor implies that the fruit of trees and the deeds of prophets both reveal whether they are good or bad. If possible, translate this in a way so that it can refer to both trees and prophets. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
