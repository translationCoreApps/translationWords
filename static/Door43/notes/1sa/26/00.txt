====== 1 Samuel 26 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Vengeance ==
David has another opportunity to kill Saul but he refuses to kill the one God had chosen as king. This contrasts with Saul, who tried to find David and kill him. Saul came to admit that David was more righteous than he was because he did not kill his enemy. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:elect]] and [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical question ==
David put his reason for not killing Saul in a rhetorical question: "Do not destroy him; for who can extend his hand against Yahweh's anointed one and be guiltless?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
