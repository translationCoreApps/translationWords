  * **This is eternal life ... know you, the only true God, and ... Jesus Christ** - Eternal life is to know the only true God, God the Father and God the Son.

  * **the work that you have given me to do** - Here "work" is a metonym that refers to Jesus' entire earthly ministry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Father, glorify me ... with the glory that I had with you before the world was made** - Jesus had glory with God the Father "before the world was made" because Jesus is God the Son.
