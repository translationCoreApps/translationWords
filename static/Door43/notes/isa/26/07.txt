  * [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:judge]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:yahweh]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:name]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]] 

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The path of the righteous is level ... the path of the righteous you make straight** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Here, obeying God is compared to walking a path. For God to make the path straight emphasizes that God always leads them in truth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in the path of your judgments, Yahweh, we wait for you** - "We wait for you, O Yahweh, as we stay on the path you have judged to be right." Here "we" refers to Isaiah and all righteous people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]]) 
  * **your name and your reputation are our desire** - "Name" and "reputation" refer to the person of God. AT: "your name and your reputation are our only desire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
