===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in the midst of the assembly** - "when my fellow Israelites and I gather together" or "when I am surrounded by my fellow worshipers of Yahweh"
  * **You who fear** - Here "You" is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **you descendants of Jacob ... you descendants of Israel** - Both of these refer to the same group of people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Stand in awe of him** - "Be full of awe for him" or "Let God's power amaze you"
