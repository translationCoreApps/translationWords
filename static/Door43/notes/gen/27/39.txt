  * **dew of the sky above** - "Dew" is drops of water that form on the plants during the night. This can be made explicit in the translation. AT: "the night mist from the sky to water your crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **By your sword you will live** - Here "sword" stands for violence. AT: "You will rob and kill people in order to get what you need to live" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
