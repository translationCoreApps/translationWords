===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked rejoice?** - The psalmist repeats the question to show that he is unhappy with how long Yahweh has allowed the wicked to rejoice. AT: "Yahweh, you have waited too long; you have waited too long to stop the wicked from rejoicing." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **will the wicked rejoice** - Why the wicked rejoice can be stated clearly. AT: "will the wicked rejoice because you never punish them for the evil deeds they do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **They ... they** - "All those who do evil ... all those who do evil"
  * **They belch** - The psalmist compares their speech to a belch to say it is rude and loud and uncontrolled. Your culture may have another word for such speech. AT: "They are rude and loud when they speak" or "They enjoy speaking evil" See how "they belch out" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:059:006|59:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they speak arrogance** - "they speak arrogantly"
