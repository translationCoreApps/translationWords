\v 8 Even though what \add I wrote\add* in my letter distressed you\f + \ft Or: made you sad \f*, I am not sorry \add that I wrote it\add*. For a while I was sorry that I had written it, \add because I knew that it would distress you\add*. Now \add Titus has also told\add* me that it did distress you \add when you read it\add*, but you were distressed only for a short time.
\v 9 \add So now\add* I am happy \add that I wrote it\add*. I am not happy that you were distressed \f + \ft Or:that \add I\add* distressed you \f*, but \add I am happy\add* because, when you became distressed, you became sorry for what you had done and \add you asked God to forgive you. What I mean is that you became sorry in the way that God wanted you to be sorry, so my making\add* you sorry did not harm you at all.
\v 10 \add The fact is that\add* when God causes \add us to be\add* truly sorry for having sinned and we turn from our sinful behavior, then God saves us \add and will not punish us for the sinful things that we have done\add*. And no one is ever sorry about that. \add However\add*, the people who do not trust \add in God\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* may be sorry \add for the sinful things that they have done\add*. But \add if they do not turn from their sinful behavior and ask God to forgive them\add*, they will remain separated from him forever.

\v 8 I know the letter I wrote to you made you sad, but I had to write it. I did regret it when I wrote it, but what I wrote to you was necessary to help you deal with the problems in the church. I knew that your sorrow would last only for a short time.
\v 9 And so now I can rejoice, not because you were sad when you read my letter, but because your sorrow turned you away from the sin that was hurting you so much, and it changed your sadness into a sorrow that God brought to you, a sorrow that gave you so much more than you had lost.
\v 10 This kind of sorrow turns a person away from sin so that God can rescue him; people are glad, in the end, to have had this kind of sorrow. On the other hand, worldly sorrow, a sadness for your sins only because you were caught in them, can lead only to death.

\v 8 Even though my letter made you sad, I do not regret it. But I did regret it when I saw that my letter made you sad. But you were sad just for a little while.
\v 9 Now I am happy, not because you were distressed, but because your sadness brought you to repentance. You experienced a godly sorrow, so you suffered no loss because of us.
\v 10 For godly sorrow brings about repentance that accomplishes salvation without regret. Worldly sorrow, however, brings about death.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul praises them for their godly sorrow, their zeal to do right, and the joy that it brought him and Titus.
  * **General Information:** - This refers to Paul's previous letter to these Corinthian believers where he rebuked them for their acceptance of a believer's sexual immorality with his father's wife.

  * **when I saw that my letter** - "when I learned that my letter"
  * **not because you were distressed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "not because what I said in my letter distressed you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **you suffered no loss because of us** - "you suffered no loss because we rebuked you." This means that although the letter caused them sorrow, they eventually benefited from the letter because it led them to repentance. AT: "so that we did not harm you in any way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **For godly sorrow brings about repentance that accomplishes salvation** - The word "repentance" may be repeated to clarify its relationship to what precedes it and what follows it. AT: "For godly sorrow produces repentance, and repentance leads to salvation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **without regret** - Possible meanings are 1) Paul has no regret that he caused them sorrow because that sorrow led to their repentance and salvation or 2) the Corinthians will not regret experiencing sorrow because it led to their repentance and salvation.
  * **Worldly sorrow, however, brings about death** - This kind of sorrow leads to death instead of salvation because it does not produce repentance. AT: "Worldly sorrow, however, leads to spiritual death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
