\v 11 \add In those days some\add* Pharisees came to Jesus. They asked him \add to perform\add* a miracle \add that would show that\add* God \add had sent him\add*. They wanted to \add find a way by which they could\add* convince the people to reject him. \add So\add* they started to argue with him.
\v 12 Jesus sighed deeply within himself, and then he said, "I am disgusted that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, \add even though\add* you people have seen how I \add have healed people\add*, you keep asking me to perform miracles! Note this: Such a miracle will certainly not be shown \f + \ft Or:I will certainly not show such a miracle \f* \add just\add* for you people!"
\v 13 Then he left them.
\p He got into the boat again, along \add with his disciples\add*, and they went further around \add Lake Galilee\add*.

\v 11 Then some Pharisees came to Jesus. They began arguing with him and insisting that he perform a miracle to show that God had sent him.
\v 12 Jesus sighed deeply within himself, and then he said, "Why are you asking me to perform a miracle? I will not do a miracle for you!"
\v 13 Then he left them. He got into the boat again, along with his disciples, and they went further around the Sea of Galilee.

\v 11 Then the Pharisees came out and began to argue with him. They sought from him a sign from heaven, to test him.
\v 12 He sighed deeply in his spirit and said, "Why does this generation seek for a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation."
\v 13 Then he left them, got into a boat again, and went away to the other side.
