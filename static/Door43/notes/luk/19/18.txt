===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The second** - "The second servant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **Your mina, lord, has made five minas** - It is implied that the servant was the one who caused the profit. AT: "Lord, I used your mina to make a profit of five more minas" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **mina** - A mina is 600 grams. Each mina was worth about what someone would be paid in four months. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:19:13|19:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]])
  * **You take charge over five cities** - "You will have authority over five cities"
