===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues the  quotation from the prophet Jeremiah in the Old Testament.

  * **No more will I remember their sins and iniquities** - This is the second part of the Holy Spirit's testimony (See: [[:en:bible:notes:heb:10:15|10:15-16]]). You can make this explicit in the translation. AT: "Then next he said, 'No more will I remember their sins and iniquities.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **No more will I remember their sins** - "I will no longer remember their sins" or "I will no longer think about their sins"
  * **sins and iniquities** - The words "sins" and "iniquities" mean basically the same thing. Together they emphasize how bad the sin is. AT: "sinful, evil deeds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Now** - This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows. 
  * **where there is forgiveness for these** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "forgiveness" is expressed as the verb "forgive." AT: "when God has forgiven these things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **there is no longer any sacrifice for sin** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "sacrifice" is expressed as the verb "make offerings." AT: "people no longer need to make offerings for sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
