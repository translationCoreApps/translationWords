===== translationNotes: =====


  * **it is at the word of your lips that I have kept myself from the ways of the lawless** - Here "the word of your lips" represents God's instruction. AT: "your instruction has caused me to avoid doing wicked things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **My steps have held firmly to your tracks ... feet have not slipped** - Both of these clauses mean the same thing. The repetition adds emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **my feet have not slipped** - The writer speaks of his obedience to God as if he were walking on a path. AT: "I am determined to follow your ways" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
