====== Revelation 22 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter emphasizes that the prophecies of the book of Revelation are going to take place soon. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Tree of life ==
There is probably an intended connection between the tree of life in the Garden of Eden and the tree of life mentioned here. The curse that began in Eden will end at this time. 


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Alpha and Omega ==

These are the names of the first and last letters in the Greek alphabet. The ULB spells out their names in English. This strategy can serve as a model for other translators.  Some translators, however, may decide to use the first and last letters in their own alphabet, for example, "A and Z" in English.
