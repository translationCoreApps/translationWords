\v 12 Because God has chosen you and set you apart as his people, and because he loves you, serve others compassionately and mercifully and with kindness. Humbly and gently care for one another with patience

\v 12 Put on, then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, intestines of mercy, kindness, lowliness, meekness, and patience.

  * **Put on ... intestines of mercy** - As a person puts on clothing when getting dressed, believers are to show mercy and other moral qualities in their behavior toward each other.
