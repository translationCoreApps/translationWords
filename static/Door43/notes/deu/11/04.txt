====== Deuteronomy 11:4-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Think about what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their chariots. Think about how he caused the Red Sea to flood\f + \ft Or: cover \f* over them while they were pursuing your ancestors, and how the army of Egypt was completely wiped out\f + \ft Or: destroyed \f*.
\v 5 Think about what Yahweh did for your ancestors in the desert before you arrived at this place.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Your children did not see the army of Egypt, or their horses and their chariots destroyed by Yahweh's power. Your children did not see how Yahweh caused the Sea of Reeds to flood and sweep away the army of Egypt as they were coming after their ancestors. Your children did not understand that Yahweh continues to make Egypt's army weak even to this day.
\v 5 Your children do not know how Yahweh took care of their ancestors in the desert before they all came to this place.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Neither did they see what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, or to their chariots, how he made the water of the Sea of Reeds overwhelm them as they pursued after you, and how Yahweh has destroyed them until today,
\v 5 or what he did for you in the wilderness until you came to this place.
