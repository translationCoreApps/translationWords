\v 25 Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain \add alive\add* and that I will \add go\f + \ft Or: come \f* to\add* be with you all. \add As a result\add*, you will believe \add in Christ\add* more firmly, and \add as a result of that\add*, you will rejoice.
\v 26 \add That is\add*, you will be able to rejoice very greatly because of Christ Jesus \add bringing\add* me \add to be with you again\add*.


\p
\v 27 Most importantly, as fellow \add believers in Christ\add*, conduct yourselves just like \add you learned you should do when you heard\add* the message about Christ. Do that in order that whether I come and see you, or whether \add I am away from you and\add* people tell me about you, \add what I hear or see will make me happy\add*. They will tell me that you are unitedly and cooperatively resisting \add those who oppose the message about Christ\add* \f + \ft Or: \add oppose you\add* \f*. I \add will know\add* that you are not allowing others to influence you to believe a message that is different from the good message \add about Christ\add*.

<usfm>
\v 25 Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain alive with you all to help you rejoice and trust Christ more.
\v 26 So you should be happy about me because of Christ Jesus when I am once again with you.
\p
\v 27 Most importantly, behave in front of the people who live around you in a way that shows that you honor the good news about Christ. Do this so that whether or not I come and see you, how you live will make me happy. They should tell me that you together are doing your best to believe and live as the good news teaches us.

<usfm>
\v 25 Being convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith.
\v 26 So that in me you may have increasing reasons to boast in Christ Jesus when I come to you again.
\v 27 Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come to see you or am absent, I may hear about you, that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel.
