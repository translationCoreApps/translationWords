\v 7 \add Moses\add* taught \add the people that if they did not obey God's laws completely they would be\add* separated from God forever. God wrote \add his laws\add* on stone slabs. \add Then he gave them to Moses to teach them to the people. Although God's laws condemned\add* the people to die, \add when Moses brought those laws down from Sinai\add* Mountain\add , God caused Moses' face to shine\add* with radiance \add to show the people that these laws were God's laws\add*. The radiance was \add so bright that\add* the people of Israel could not keep looking at Moses' face. \add They had to look away\add*. But although the radiance \add was bright, it\add* was slowly fading away.
\v 8 \add So\add*, \add since God showed in such a wonderful way that those laws that condemned them to die were from him\add*, surely when we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* teach \add people about how God's\add* Spirit will \add change their lives\add*, \add God will show\add* in an even more wonderful way \add that\add* it is \add his message.\f + \ft Or: will not God show\add* in an even more wonderful way \add that\add* it is \add his message\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 7 God's law brings death, and he wrote it on stone tablets, and he gave it to Moses. It came with the brilliant light that always shines where God is. And that glory shined on Moses' face; his face shined so brightly that the Israelites could not look at his face. That bright light slowly faded from his face.
\v 8 How much more brightly does the ministry of the Spirit shine!

\v 7 Now the service that produced death—engraved in letters on stones—came in such glory that the people of Israel could not look directly at Moses' face. This is because of the glory of his face, a glory that was fading.
\v 8 How much more glorious will be the service that the Spirit does?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul contrasts the fading glory of the old covenant with the superiority and freedom of the new covenant. He contrasts the veil of Moses with the clarity of present revelation. The time of Moses was a less clear picture of what is now revealed.

  * **Now the service that produced death ... came in such glory** - Paul emphasizes that although the law leads to death, it was still very glorious. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **the service that produced** - "the ministry of death." This refers to the Old Testament law that God gave through Moses. AT: "the ministry that causes death because it is based on the law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **engraved in letters on stones** - "carved into stone with letters." This can be stated in active form. AT: "that God carved into stone with letters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **in such glory** - "in so much glory"
  * **This is because** - "They could not look because"
  * **How much more glorious will be the service that the Spirit does?** - Paul uses this question to emphasize that "the service that the Spirit does" must be more glorious than "the service that produced" because it leads to life. AT: "So the service that the Spirit does must be even more glorious" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the service that the Spirit does** - "the ministry of the Spirit." This refers to the new covenant, of which Paul is a minister. AT: "the ministry that gives life because it is based on the Spirit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
