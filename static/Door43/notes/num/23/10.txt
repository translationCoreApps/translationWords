  * **Who can count the dust of Jacob or number even only one-fourth of Israel?** - Here "dust of Jacob" is a metaphor that speaks of the number of Israelites as if they were as numerous as the specks of dust. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "There are too many Israelites to count. No one could count even a fourth of them because there are so many." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the death of a righteous person** - It is understood that this will be a peaceful death. This can be stated. AT: "the peaceful death of a righteous person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a righteous person ... like his** - These are metonymies that refer to the people of Israel as a single person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
