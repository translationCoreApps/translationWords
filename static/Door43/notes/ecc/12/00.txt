====== Ecclesiastes 12 General Notes ======



=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 10, which is an extended quotation. Some lines are indented twice to further set them apart. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Advice ==
This chapter gives a series of disconnected pieces of advice. Translators should not try to smooth the transitions between these pieces of advice. The advice in these statements do not apply in every situation. Therefore, they should be seen as "good ideas."

== Yahweh ==
At the end of a very impressive life, Solomon looks back and sees that the only real lasting thing in this world is Yahweh. The purpose of his life was to honor Yahweh, something he should have done far more throughout his life. Therefore, he felt that his life was wasted. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
