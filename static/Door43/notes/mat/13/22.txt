\v 22 Some people hear God's message, but they desire to be rich, so they worry only about money and what they can buy with money. As a result, they forget God's message and they do not do the things that God wants them to do. These people are like the soil that had the roots of thorny weeds in it.
\v 23 But some people hear my message and understand it. Some of them do many things that please God, some do even more things that please God, and some do very many things that please God. They are like the good soil where some of the seeds fell."

\v 22 What was sown among the thorn plants, this is the person who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
\v 23 What was sown on the good soil, this is the person who hears the word and understands it. He bears fruit and makes a crop, yielding one hundred times as much as was planted, some sixty, and some thirty times as much."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to explain to his disciples the parable about a person who sows seeds.

  * **What was sown** - This refers to seed that was sown or that fell. AT: "The seed that was sown" or "The seed that fell"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **What was sown among the thorn plants** - "the ground with the thorn plants where seed was sown"  
  * **this is the person** - "this represents the person"
  * **the word** - Here "the word" represents God's message. AT: "the message" or "God's teaching" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word** - Jesus speaks about the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches distracting a person from obeying God's word as if they were weeds that could wind around a plant and keep it from growing.  AT: "as weeds prevent good plants from growing, the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches keep this person from listening to God's word" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **cares of the world** - "the things in this world that people worry about"
  * **the deceitfulness of riches** - Jesus describes "riches" as if it were a person who could deceive someone. This means people think having more money will make them happy, but it will not. AT: "the love of money" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) 
  * **he becomes unfruitful** - The person is spoken of as if he were a plant. Being unfruitful represents being unproductive. AT: "he becomes unproductive" or "he does not do what God wants." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **What was sown on the good soil** - "The good soil where seeds were sown"
  * **He bears fruit and makes a crop** - The person is spoken of as if he were a plant. AT: "Like a healthy plant that bears a crop of fruit, he is productive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **yielding one hundred times as much as was planted, some sixty, and some thirty times as much** - The phrase "as much as was planted" is understood following each of these numbers. AT: "Some people produce 100 times as much as was planted, some produce 60 times as much, and some produce 30 times as much." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:07|13:8]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
