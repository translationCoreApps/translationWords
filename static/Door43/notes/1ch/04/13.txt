===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - It may be helpful to create a verse bridge and to put verse 15 together with verse 13 since Kenaz was a descendant of Jephunneh and Caleb. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])

  * **Kenaz ... Othniel ... Seraiah ... Hathath ... Meonothai ... Ophrah ... Joab ... Jephunneh ... Iru ... Elah ... Naam ... Jehallelel ... Ziph ... Ziphah ... Tiria ... Asarel** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Ge Harashim, whose people were craftsmen** - Ge Harashim means "Valley of Craftsmen." The meaning of the name can be translated or it can be made explicit with an explanation: "Ge Harashim, which means 'Craftsmen's Valley.' It was called this because its people were craftsmen." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **craftsmen** - people skilled at making or building things
