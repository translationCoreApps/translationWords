\q1 Now your towns have been burned,
\q2 and no one lives in them.
\q1
\v 16 Soldiers from Memphis and Tahpenes, cities in Egypt, have defeated you
\q2 and shaved your heads to show that you are their slaves.

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 Is Israel a slave? Was he not born at home? So why has he become plunder?
\q
\v 15 Young lions roared against him. They made a lot of noise and made his land a horror.
\q His cities are destroyed without any inhabitants.
\q
\v 16 Also, the people of Memphis and Tahpanhes will shave your skull.

\q
\v 17 Did you not do this to yourselves
\q when you abandoned Yahweh your God, while he was leading you along the way?
