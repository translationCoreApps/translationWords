\v 1 During the twentieth year after King Artaxerxes \add began to rule the Persian Empire\add*, during the spring\f + \ft Or: before the hot season \f* of that year, when it was time to serve wine to him \add during a feast\add*, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had never looked sad when I was in front of him before, \add but on that day he saw that I looked very sad\add*.
\v 2 So he asked me, "Why are you sad? \add I know that\add* you are not sick. It must be that you are sad in your inner being." Then I was very afraid, \add because it was not proper to be sad when I came to the king\add* \f + \ft Or: \add because I was worried what the king would do to me if he refused to do what I was about to request him to do\add* \f*.

\v 1 In the month of Nisan during the twentieth year of the rule of King Artaxerxes, it was time to serve wine to him during a feast. I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had never looked sad when I was before the king.
\v 2 But that day, the king looked at me and he said to me, "Why are you so sad? You do not look sick. Perhaps your spirit is troubled?" Then I was very afraid.

\v 1 In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, he selected wine, and I took the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never before been sad in his presence.
\v 2 But the king said to me, "Why is your face so sad? You do not appear to be ill. This must be sadness of heart." Then I became very much afraid.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **In the month of Nisan** - "Nisan" is the name of the first month of the Hebrew calendar. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]])
  * **in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king** - "in the 20th year that Artaxerxes was king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]]) 
  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Nehemiah tells background information about his demeanor before the king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **But the king** - "So the king"
  * **Why is your face so sad** - Here Nehemiah is referred to by his face because the face shows one's emotions. AT: "Why are you so sad" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **This must be sadness of heart** - This speaks of Nehemiah being sad as if his heart were sad, since the heart is often considered the center of emotions. AT: "You must be very sad" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Then I became very much afraid** - As Nehemiah prepares to answer, he is afraid because he does not know how the king will respond.
