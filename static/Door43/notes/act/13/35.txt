<usfm>
\v 35 So \add in writing\add* another \add Psalm, David\add* said this \add to God about the Messiah\add*: 'Because I am devoted to you and always obey \add you, when I die\add* you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* will not let my body decay.'
\v 36 While David was living, he did what God wanted him to do. And when he died \f + \ft euphemism \f*, his \add body\add* was buried, \add as\add* his ancestors' \add bodies had been buried\add*, and his body decayed. \add So he could not have been speaking about himself in this Psalm\add*.
\v 37 \add Instead, he was speaking about Jesus. Jesus also died\add*, but God raised him from the dead\f + \ft Or: caused him to live again \f*, and \add therefore\add* his body did not decay."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 In another Psalm of David, he also says about the Messiah: 'You will not allow the body of your holy one to decay.'
\v 36 While David was living, he did what God wanted him to do. And when he died, his body was buried, as his ancestors' bodies had been buried, and his body decayed. So he could not have been speaking about himself in this Psalm.
\v 37 But Jesus was the one God raised from the dead, and his body did not decay."

\m
\v 35 This is why he also says in another Psalm,
\q 'You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.'
\m
\v 36 For when David had served the desires of God in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was laid with his fathers and his body experienced decay.
\v 37 But he whom God raised up experienced no decay.
