\v 27 I replied, "There are no wise men or fortune-tellers or men who work magic or men who work sorcery who can tell such things to you.
\v 28 But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets. And he has shown in \add your dream\add* what will happen in the future. Now I will tell you what you dreamed, and the vision you saw \add as you were lying\add* on your bed.

\v 27 Daniel replied, "There is no one to help, even those who claim to be wise and those who claim to consult with the dead. No one can help, none of the magicians or astrologers. None of these can discover the secrets of your dream.
\v 28 But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has shown in your dream what will happen in the future. Now I will tell you what you dreamed and the vision you saw as you were lying on your bed.

\v 27 Daniel answered the king and said, "The mystery that the king has demanded cannot be revealed by those who have wisdom, nor by those who claim to speak with the dead, nor by magicians, and not by astrologers.
\v 28 Nevertheless, there is a God who lives in the heavens, who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to you, King Nebuchadnezzar, what will happen in the days to come. These were your dream and the visions of your mind as you lay on your bed.
