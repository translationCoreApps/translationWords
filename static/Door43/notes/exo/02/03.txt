\v 3 When she was unable to hide him any longer, she got a basket made from tall reeds. She covered the basket with tar so it would float in water. Then she put the baby in the basket and put the basket in the water. It was at the edge of the Nile River in the middle of the tall reeds.
\v 4 His older sister was standing close by, watching to see what would happen to him.

\v 3 But when she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket and sealed it with bitumen and pitch. Then she put the child in it and placed it among the reeds in the water along the side of the river.
\v 4 His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **papyrus basket** - This is a basket made from a tall grass that grows by the Nile River in Egypt.
  * **sealed it with bitumen and pitch** - You could explicitly state that this was to keep out water. AT: "spread tar on it to keep water from getting into it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **sealed** - Here "sealed" means that she applied a waterproof coating.
  * **bitumen** - This is a sticky black paste made from petroleum. It can be used to keep out water. AT: "tar" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **pitch** - This is a sticky brown or black paste that can be made from tree sap or from petroleum. Therefore, "pitch" would include not only "bitumen" but also plant-based resins. It too can be used to keep out water. AT: "tar" or "resin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **reeds** - These "reeds" were a type of tall grass that grew in flat, wet areas.
  * **at a distance** - This means she stood far enough away so that she would not be noticed, but close enough to see the basket.
