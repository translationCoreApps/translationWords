===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - When Jesus and his disciples arrive at Gennesaret in their boat, people see him and bring people for him to heal. This happens wherever they go.

  * **Gennesaret** - This is the name of the region to the northwest of the Sea of Galilee. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **they ran throughout the whole region** - It may be helpful to state why they ran through the region. AT: "they ran throughout the whole district in order to tell others that Jesus was there" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **they ran ... they heard** - The word "they" refers to the people who recognized Jesus, not to the disciples.
  * **the sick** - This phrase refers to people. AT: "the sick people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
