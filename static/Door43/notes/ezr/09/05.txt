\v 5 When it was time to offer those sacrifices, I was still sitting there, wearing those torn clothes and mourning\f + \ft Or: sad \f*. I stood up, and then I quickly prostrated myself on the ground. I lifted up my hands to Yahweh, my God,
\v 6 and this is what I prayed:
\pi "Yahweh my God, I am very ashamed to raise my head in front of you. The sins that we Israelites have committed \add are very great; it is as though they\add* have risen up higher than our heads, and our guilt \add for committing those sins, it is as though it\add* rises up to the heavens.

\v 5 But at the evening offering I arose from my position of humiliation in my torn clothes and robe, and knelt down and spread my hands to Yahweh my God.
\v 6 I said, "My God, I am ashamed and disgraced to raise my face to you, for our iniquities increase over our head, and our guilt grows to the heavens.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my position of humiliation** - another way of saying he was "sitting ashamed" (﻿﻿[[:en:bible:notes:ezr:09:03|9:4]]). "where I was sitting on the ground to show how ashamed I was"
  * **knelt down and spread my hands** - "got on my knees and stretched out my arms with my hands open toward the sky"
  * **our iniquities increase over our head, and our guilt grows to the heavens** - These words are two ways of speaking of iniquity and guilt as if they were physical objects that could grow to be larger than people. The abstract nouns "iniquity" and "guilt" can be expressed as a noun and an adjective, respectively. AT: "we have committed wicked deeds and we are very guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
