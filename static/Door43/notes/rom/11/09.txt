\v 9 The Jews remind me of what King David said, when he asked God to cause his enemies' senses to be dull:
"Make them stupid, like animals that fall into nets or traps! May they feel as safe as if they were at their banquets, but let those feasts be times when you will catch them, and they will sin, with the result that you will destroy them.
\q
\v 10 May they not see the danger when it comes to them. May you always make them suffer because of their troubles."

\v 9 And David says,
\q "Let their table be made a net, a trap,
\q a stumbling block, and retaliation against them.
\q
\v 10 Let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see.
\q Always keep their backs bent."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let their table be made a net, a trap** - "Table" is a metonym that represents feasting, and "net" and "trap" are metaphors that represent punishment. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "Please, God, make their feasts a trap that catches them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a stumbling block** - Paul speaks of someone sinning as if he were falling down. A "stumbling block" is anything that causes a person to trip so that he falls down. AT: "something that tempts someone to sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and retaliation against them** - "something that allows you to take revenge on them"
  * **Always keep their backs bent** - David asks God to turn his enemies into slaves who always carry heavy loads on their backs. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
