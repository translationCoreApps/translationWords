  * **It came about** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **in the six hundred and first year** - "when Noah was 601 years old" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **the first month, on the first day of the month** - Since Moses wrote this book it is possible he is referring to the first month of the Hebrew calendar, but this is uncertain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **the waters were dried up from off the earth** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the waters covering the earth dried up" or "the wind dried up the waters covering the earth" (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]).
  * **the covering of the ark** - This refers to a cover that kept the rain water from going into the ark.
  * **behold** - The word "behold" tells us to pay attention to the important information that comes next.
