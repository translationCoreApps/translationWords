===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In this chapter, Nebuchadnezzar tells what God did to him. In verses 1-18, Nebuchadnezzar describes in the first person his vision from God. Verses 19-33 switch to the third person to describe the punishment of Nebuchadnezzar. Verses 34-37 change back to first person as Nebuchadnezzar describes his response to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])

  * **King Nebuchadnezzar sent** - This phrase is referring to the king's messenger as the king himself. AT: "Nebuchadnezzar sent his messengers with" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **peoples, nations, and languages** - Here "nations" and "languages" represent people from different nations who speak different languages.

  * **who lived on the earth** - Kings would often exaggerate how wide their kingdom was. Nebuchadnezzar did rule over most of the known world at the time this book was written. AT: "who lived in the kingdom of Babylon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
