\v 20 Then Job stood up and tore his robe and shaved his head because he was very sad. Then he laid down on the ground to worship God.
\v 21 He said,
\q1 "When I was born, I was wearing no clothes.
\q1 When I die, I will not take any clothes with me.
\q1 It is Yahweh who gave me everything that I possessed,
\q1 and it is Yahweh who has taken it all away.
\q1 But we must always praise Yahweh!"
\p
\v 22 So in spite of all the things that happened to Job, he did speak not like a foolish manâ€”he did not sin by saying that what God had done was wrong.

\v 20 Then Job rose, tore his robe, shaved his head, lay facedown on the ground, and worshiped God.
\v 21 He said, "It was naked that I out of my mother's womb, and it is naked that I will return there. It is Yahweh who gave, and it is Yahweh who has taken away. May the name of Yahweh be blessed."
\v 22 In all this matter, Job did not sin, nor did he accuse God of wrongdoing.
