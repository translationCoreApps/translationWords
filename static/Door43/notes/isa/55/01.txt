===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem in exile through Isaiah.
  * **General Information:** - Yahweh speaks of blessing the people freely as if he were selling food and drink to needy people for free. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **Come ... Come** - The repetition of this word four times adds a sense of urgency to the invitation.
  * **buy wine and milk without money and without cost** - There is a sense of irony in this statement since a person usually has to use money to buy something. This emphasizes Yahweh's amazing grace in giving these things freely. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
