===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 18 Surely you put them in slippery places;
\q you bring them down to ruin.
\q
\v 19 How they become a wilderness in a moment!
\q They come to an end and are finished in awful terrors.
\q
\v 20 They are like a dream after one wakes up;
\q2 Lord, when you arise, you will think nothing of those dreams.

  * **put them** - The word "them" refers to the wicked.

  * **How they become a wilderness in a moment** - The word "wilderness" is a metaphor for a person who has lost everything good. AT: "How quickly they are destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **like a dream after one wakes up** - The wicked will last no longer than what a person sees in a dream. It disappears as soon as the person wakes up. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
