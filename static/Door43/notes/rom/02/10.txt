\v 10 But God will praise, honor, and give a peaceful spirit to every person who habitually does good deeds. He will certainly do this for the Jews because he chose them as his special people, but he will also do it for the non-Jews.
\v 11 God will do this fairly, because he pays no attention to how important anyone is.


\p
\v 12 Although non-Jews do not have the laws that God gave to Moses and still sin without having a law, God will bring them to ruin forever. And he will also punish all the Jews who have disobeyed his law, because he will judge them according to what the law says.

\v 10 But praise, honor, and peace will come to everyone who practices good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 
\v 11 For there is no partiality with God. 
\v 12 For as many as have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and as many as have sinned in respect to the law will be judged by the law.
