\v 4 John wore rough clothing made from camel's hair. As the prophet Elijah had done so long ago, he wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was only grasshoppers and honey that he found in the wilderness.
\v 5 People who lived in the city of Jerusalem, many people who lived in other places in the district of Judea, and many others who lived near the Jordan River came to John to hear him preach.
\v 6 After they heard him, they openly confessed their sins, and then he baptized them in the Jordan River.
