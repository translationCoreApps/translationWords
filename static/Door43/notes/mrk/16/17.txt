\v 17 Those who believe the good news will perform miracles to show that I am with them. By my power they will do miracles like these: they will force evil spirits out of people. They will speak in languages that they have not learned.
\v 18 If they pick up snakes or if they drink any poisonous liquid, they will not be hurt. God will heal sick people on whom they lay their hands."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 \f + \ft The best ancient copies omit Mark 16:9-20. \f* These signs will go with those who believe: In my name they will cast out demons. They will speak in new languages.
\v 18 They will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well."

===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:demon]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **These signs will go with those who believe** - Mark speaks of miracles as though they were people going along with the believers. AT: "People watching those who believe will see these things happen and know that I am with the believers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **In my name they** - Possible meanings are 1) Jesus is giving a general list: "In my name they will do things like these: They" or 2) Jesus is giving an exact list: "These are the things they will do in my name: They."
  * **In my name** - Here "name" is associated with Jesus' authority and power. AT: "By the authority of my name" or "By the power of my name." See how "in your name" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:09:38|9:38]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
