\v 1 My brothers and sisters, not many of you should desire to become teachers of God's word, because you know that God will judge us teachers more severely than he will judge other people.
\v 2 In many ways we do what is wrong. But those who control what they say will be all that God intends them to be. They will be able to control all their actions.

\v 1 Not many people should become teachers, my brothers. We know that we will receive more severe judgment.
\v 2 For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in words, he is a fully developed man, able to control even his whole body.
