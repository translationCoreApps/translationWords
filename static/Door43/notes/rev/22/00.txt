=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== River of Life ==
There is probably an intended a connection between the tree of life in the Garden of Eden and the tree of life mentioned here. The curse which began in Eden, will end at this time. 


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Alpha and omega ==

These are the names of the first and last Greek letters. The ULB does not "translate" these words into English but chooses to "transliterate" or transfer them into English by substituting English letters for Greek letters.The translator should try to form the sounds of this phrase without translating their meaning.
