So if someone sells one of those houses, he is permitted to buy it back at any time. And \add if he does not buy it\add*, it must be returned to him in the Year of Celebration.
\p
\v 32 If any descendants of Levi sell their houses in the towns in which they live, they are permitted to buy them back at any time.

\v 31 But houses that are in villages without walls are considered to be as though they were in a field. So if someone sells one of those houses, he is permitted to buy it back at any time. And even if he does not buy it, he will take possession of it again at the year of the celebration of Jubilee.
\p
\v 32 The descendants of Levi are a special case, however. If they sell their houses in the cities that belong to them, they are permitted to buy them back at any time.

\v 31 But the houses of the villages that have no wall around them will be considered as the field of the land. They may be redeemed, and they must be returned during the year of Jubilee.
\v 32 However, the houses owned by the Levites in their cities may be redeemed at any time.
