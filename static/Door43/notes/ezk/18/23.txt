===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh speaka about his desire for wicked people.

  * **Do I greatly rejoice over the death of the wicked ... and not in his turning away from his way so that he may live?** - Yahweh asks this rhetorical question in order to emphasize the opposite. AT: "I do not greatly rejoice over the death of the wicked ... but I do greatly rejoice if he turns away from his way so that he may live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **not in his turning away from his way** - Yahweh speaks of a person's lifestyle or behavior as if it were a way on which the person walks.
