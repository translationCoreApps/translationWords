====== Genesis 33 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Jacob's fear ==
Jacob feared his brother. He showed Esau great respect and sought to protect his family from Esau's power. He did not fear and trust Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fear]] and [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])

== Favoritism ==
Jacob showed favoritism towards Rachel and Joseph. He arranged the family according to those he loved the most. Rachel and Joseph were the most protected from a potential attack by Esau. He would have rather had everyone else die, in order to spare their lives. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:favor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
