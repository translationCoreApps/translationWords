====== Matthew 28 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Make disciples" ==
These two verses ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:28:18|28:19-20]]) are commonly known as "The Great Commission" because they contain a very important command given to all Christians. Christians are to "make disciples" by going to people, sharing the gospel with them and training them to live as Christians.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter===

== An angel of the Lord ==
The gospel accounts differ as to how many men or angels appeared in this interaction. It is probably that the men were angels, but their number is unclear. It is best to translate this as it appears in the ULB without trying to reconcile these passages. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:16:05|Mark 16:5]], [[:en:bible:notes:luk:24:04|Luke 24:4]], and [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:20:01|John 20:1-2]])
