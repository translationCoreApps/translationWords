\v 25 When they began to disagree with each other, and when they were about to leave, Paul had one more thing to say: "The Holy Spirit said the truth to your ancestors, when he spoke these words to Isaiah the prophet:
\q
\v 26 Go to your people and say to them:

He said, 'Go to this people and say, "By hearing you will hear, but not understand; And seeing you will see, but will not perceive** - This has quotations within quotations. You can translate one of the inner quotations as an indirect quotation as in the UDB. Or, you can translate two of the inner quotations as indirect quotations. AT: "The Holy Spirit spoke well through Isaiah the prophet to your forefathers when the Spirit told Isaiah to tell them that they will hear but will not understand; And they will see but they will not perceive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
