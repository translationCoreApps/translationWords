====== Galatians 02:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 After fourteen years passed, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas. I took Titus also.
\v 2 But \add I tell you that\add* I went up there because of what God revealed to me. \add It was not because someone asked me to come\add*. I told people what was the good message that I was preaching in regions where non-Jews live. But I talked privately to those whom your new teachers highly respect. I did that in order that what I was doing and what I had done \f + \ft metaphor \f* might not become useless \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add as a result of people rejecting my message because they thought that I was teaching something that was not true\add*.

\v 1 After fourteen years passed, Barnabas, Titus, and I went up again to Jerusalem.
\v 2 We did this because God had told me we should go. I explained privately to the most important leaders of the believers the content of the good news that I had been proclaiming in the regions of the non-Jews. I did this because I wanted to make sure that they approved of what I had been preaching. I wanted to make sure that I had not been working uselessly.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas. I also took Titus with me.
\v 2 I went up because God revealed to me that I should go. I put before them the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles. (But I spoke privately to those who seemed to be important leaders). I did this to make sure that I was not running, or had run, for nothing.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues to give the history of how he learned the gospel from God, not the apostles.

  * **went up** - "traveled." Jerusalem is located in hilly country. The Jews also viewed Jerusalem as the place on earth that is closest to heaven, so Paul may have been speaking figuratively.
  * **I should go** - Your language may require that you state where Paul would go. AT: "I should go to Jerusalem" or "I should go there" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **those who seemed to be important leaders** - "the most important leaders among the believers" 
  * **I was not running, or had run, for nothing** - Paul uses running as a metaphor for work, and he uses a double negative to emphasize that the work he had done was profitable. AT: "I was doing, or had done, profitable work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for nothing** - "for no benefit"
