===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus receives and blesses little children.

  * **some little children were brought to him** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "some people brought little children to Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Permit** - "Allow"
  * **do not forbid them to come to me** - "do not stop them from coming to me"
  * **for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such ones** - Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. This phrase is found only in the book of Matthew. If possible, keep "heaven" in your translation. AT: "for when our God in heaven establishes his rule on earth, he will be king over such as these" or "for God will allow such as these into his kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **belongs to such ones** - "belongs to those who are like children." This is a simile that means those who are humble like children will enter God's kingdom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
