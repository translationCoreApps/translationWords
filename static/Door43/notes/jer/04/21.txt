\v 21 How long will I see the standard? Will I hear the sound of the horn?
\v 22 For the foolishness of my peopleâ€”they do not know me. They are idiotic people and they have no understanding. They have skill at evil, but do not know to do good.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **How long will I see the standard? Will I hear the sound of the horn?** - These two sentences have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. AT: "I wish this war would end soon." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **idiotic people** - "stupid people"
