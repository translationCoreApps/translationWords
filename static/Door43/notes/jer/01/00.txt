====== Jeremiah 01 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:4-10, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Jeremiah appointed as prophet ==

God chose Jeremiah to be his prophet and although many powerful people would be against him, God promised to protect him. This chapter emphasizes that Jeremiah was chosen by God to be his prophet.(See: [[:en:obe:kt:appoint]], [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:elect]] and [[:en:obe:kt:promise]])

== Northern kingdoms ==
This was not a reference to the northern kingdom of Israel; it had already been conquered. It a reference to kingdom located north of Judah. Babylon would come to conquer Judah and it was located to the north.

== Opposition ==
The people were supposed to listen to God's prophet. When he prophesied, they should have repented. Instead, they persecuted Jeremiah. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:repent]])
