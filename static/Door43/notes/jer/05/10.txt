<usfm>
\q
\v 10 Go up onto her vineyards' terraces and destroy. But do not bring complete destruction to them.
\q Trim their vines, since those vines do not come from Yahweh.
\q
\v 11 For the houses of Israel and Judah have completely betrayed me—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q
\v 12 and they have denied me. They say, 'He is not real.
\q Evil will not come on us, nor will we see sword or famine.
\q
\v 13 For the prophets have become as useless as the wind and there is no one else to declare Yahweh's messages to us. Let their threats come upon themselves.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak.

  * **Go up onto her vineyards' terraces** - "Get up over her walls." Yahweh is comparing the city of Jerusalem to a vineyard that has a wall around it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Go up** - Yahweh is speaking to the enemies of people living in Jerusalem.
  * **do not bring complete destruction to them** - "do not completely destroy them"
  * **Trim their vines, since those vines do not come from Yahweh** - Yahweh compares how the enemies of Jerusalem will rid of her people to how people cut branches off of a vine. AT: "Get rid of all of the evil people because they do not come from Yahweh." 
  * **For the houses of Israel and Judah** - AT: "For the people of Israel and Judah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself as if he were another person so that Jeremiah and the people of Judah will listen carefully to what he says. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|01:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what Yahweh has said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **they have denied me** - This could also be translated as, "they have lied about me."
  * **He is not real** - "Yahweh does not exist." This could also be translated as "He will not do these things" or "He cannot do these things"
  * **Evil will not come on us, nor will we see sword or famine** - These two sentences say the same thing, the second is more specific than the first. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **Evil will not come on us** - This expression means "Bad things will not happen to us."
  * **nor will we see sword or famine** - AT: "and we will not experience war or famine." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
