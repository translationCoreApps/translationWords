====== John 08:14-16 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Jesus replied, "Even if I were the \add only one to\add* say these things about myself, what I say is true, because I know that I came from \add heaven\add*, and I know that I am going \add back to heaven\add*. But \bd you\bd* do not know where I came from or where I am going.
\v 15 \bd You\bd* judge people according to human standards. \add The reason\add* that \bd I\bd* am \add here is\add* not to condemn people\f + \ft Or: to say that I will punish people \f* \add for their sins\add*.
\v 16 But if I did judge \add people\add*, what I decided would be correct, because I am not the \add only\add* one \add who will decide those things\add*. I and the one who sent me will both decide.

\v 14 Jesus replied, "Even if I were the only one to say these things about myself, what I say is true because I know where I came from and I know where I am going. Nevertheless, you do not know where I came from and you do not know where I am going.
\v 15 You judge people according to human standards and the laws of men. I have not come at this time to judge anyone.
\v 16 When I do judge, it will be right and just because I am not the only one who will bring justice. I and the Father who sent me, we will execute justice together.

\v 14 Jesus answered and said to them, "Even if I bear witness about myself, my witness is true. I know where I came from and where I am going, but you do not know where I came from or where I am going.
\v 15 You judge according the flesh; I judge no one.
\v 16 Yet if I judge, my judgment is true because I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.

  * **my judgment is true** - Possible meanings are 1) "my judgment will be right" or 2) "my judgment is right."
  * **I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me** - Jesus, the Son of God, has authority because of his special relationship with his Father. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **I am not alone** - The implied information is that Jesus is not alone in his judgment. AT: "I am not alone in how I judge" or "I do not judge alone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I am with the Father** - The Father and the Son judge together. AT: "the Father also judges with me" or "the Father judges as I do." 
  * **the Father** - This is an important title for God. If your language must state whose Father this is, you could say "my Father" since Jesus switches to that in the following verses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
