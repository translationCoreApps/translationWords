\q
\v 12 You Cushites also will be pierced by my sword,
\q
\v 13 and God's hand will attack the north and destroy Assyria, 
\q so that Nineveh will become an abandoned devastation, as dry as the desert.
\q
\v 14 Then herds will lie down there, every animal of the nations, 
\q both the desert owl and the hedgehog will rest in the top of her columns. 
\q A call will sing out from the windows; rubble will be in the doorways; her carved cedar beams will be exposed.
