===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh is talking about Israel.

  * **You have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread over Tabor** - A snare and a net are both objects used to catch prey. In this case, the priests and the royal household had devised ways to keep the people away from Yahweh, while enticing them into idolatry. Mizpah and Tabor were places for idol worship in the land of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The rebels stand deep in slaughter** - Here "rebels" refers to all of those people who had turned away from Yahweh, and "deep in slaughter" could refer to the murder of innocent people, of to the slaughter of animals offered to pagan idols. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The rebels** - The translator can represent this as "You rebels," because God is really talking to the rebellious people of Israel. 
  * **in slaughter** - Some modern versions interpret the Hebrew expression as standing for wickedness. 
  * **I will punish all of them** - The translator can represent this as "I will punish all of you."
