===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Your wrath lies heavy on me** - This speaks about God being very angry with the writer as if God's wrath were a heavy object lying on top of the writer. AT: "I feel your great anger" or "I feel how very angry you are with me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **all your waves crash over me** - This speaks about God being very angry with the writer as if God's anger were large waves rising up from the sea then landing on the writer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Selah** - This may be a musical term that tells people how to sing or play their instruments here. Some translations write the Hebrew word, and some translations do not include it. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:003:001|3:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
