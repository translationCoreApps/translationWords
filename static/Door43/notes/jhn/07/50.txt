\v 50 Then Nicodemus spoke. (He was the one who had gone to see Jesus at night to speak with him, and he was one of the Pharisees.) He said to them,
\v 51 "Our Jewish law does not permit us to condemn a man before we have listened to him. First, we give him a hearing, and we must learn about what he has done."
\v 52 They replied to him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search carefully and read what is written in the scriptures! You will find that no prophet comes from Galilee."

\v 50 Nicodemus (one of the Pharisees, who came to him earlier), said to them,
\v 51 "Does our law judge a man before hearing from him and knowing what he does?"
\v 52 They answered and said to him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet comes from Galilee."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **one of the Pharisees, who came to him earlier** - John provides this information to remind us of who Nicodemus is. Your language may have a special way to mark background information. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **Does our law judge a man ... what he does?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "Our Jewish law does not allow us to judge a man ... what he does!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Does our law judge a man** - Here Nicodemus speaks of the law as if it were a person. If this is not natural in your language, you may translate it with a personal subject. AT: "Do we judge a man" or "we do not judge a man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) 
  * **Are you also from Galilee?** - The Jewish leaders know that Nicodemus is not from Galilee. They ask this question as a way of scoffing at him. AT: "You must also be one of those inferior persons from Galilee!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Search and see** - This is an ellipsis. You may wish to include the information that does not appear. AT: "Search carefully and read what is written in the Scriptures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **no prophet comes from Galilee** - This probably refers to the belief that Jesus was born in Galilee.
