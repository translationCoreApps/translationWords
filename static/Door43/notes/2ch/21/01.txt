\v 1 Jehoshaphat slept with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David; Jehoram, his son, became king in his place.
\v 2 Jehoram had brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel.
\v 3 Their father had given them large gifts of silver, gold, and other precious things, and also fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the throne to Jehoram, because he was his firstborn.
