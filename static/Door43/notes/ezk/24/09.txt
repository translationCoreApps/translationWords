===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to compare Jerusalem with a cooking pot.

  * **I will also enlarge the pile of wood** - It is implied that the pile of wood is under the cooking pot, which represents Jerusalem. "I will make the pile of wood on the fire under you even bigger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Stack up ... kindle ... Cook ... let the bones be charred** - Yahweh gives these commands to imaginary people who are part of the metaphor. 
  * **let the bones be charred** - "burn the bones." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
