===== translationNotes: =====

  * **you** - The word "you" refers to God.
  * **what can mere man do to me?** - Here a question is used to show that the psalmist is not afraid of people, because they cannot seriously harm him. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "mere man can do nothing to me!" or "mere man cannot harm me badly!"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **mere man** - "just humans" or "people." This implies that people are not powerful, but God is powerful.
