===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Hannah's prayer to Yahweh continues.

  * **the affliction of your servant** - This refers either 1) to Hannah being unable to become pregnant or 2) the way Peninnah always insulted her. The abstract noun "affliction" can be translated as a verb phrase. AT: "how I am suffering because I cannot become pregnant" or "how that woman is afflicting me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **call me to mind** - This is a special plea to God to take action on Hannah's behalf. God does know what is happening to Hannah; he has not forgotten.
  * **do not forget your servant** - This phrase says almost the same thing as "call me to mind." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
