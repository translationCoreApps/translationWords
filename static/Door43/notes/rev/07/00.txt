====== Revelation 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Many scholars believe the first half of this chapter is about a great revival among the Hebrew people, where 144,000 will come to believe in Jesus. The tribe of Dan is noticeably absent from this list. The second half of this chapter would then be able a great revival among the Gentiles where countless Gentiles will come to believe in Jesus. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:believe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_apocalypticwriting]])

The ULB has chosen to set apart 7:5-8 and 7:15-17 through the use of indentation. These passages are extended prophecies. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Worship ==
The people in this chapter respond to these events with repentance and worship. This is the proper response to the information contained in this book. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:reveal]], [[:en:obe:kt:repent]] and [[:en:obe:kt:worship]])

== The Great Tribulation ==
This is a period when the people of the earth will be greatly punished by God. There is some disagreement about this period but many scholars believe it is a reference to the last half of the seven years of tribulation prophesied in Revelation 4-19, and in the rest of Scripture. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== The Lamb ==
This is a reference to Jesus. In this chapter, it also functions as a title for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
