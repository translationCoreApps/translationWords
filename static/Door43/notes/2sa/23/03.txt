===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues David's last words.
 
  * **The God of Israel spoke, the Rock of Israel ... me** - Here the "God of Israel" is the same as the "Rock of Israel." The two phrases say essentially the same thing. David compares God to a rock to emphasize his power to protect his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The one who rules righteously over men, who rules in the fear of God** - These two sentences both say that the king will respect God and do what God wants him to do. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **in the fear of God** - "respecting God"
  * **He will be like the morning light ... sunshine after rain** - Here God is comparing the king to the morning light and sunshine after the rain. These are all ways of saying this king would be a delight to God and a blessing for the people. These two phrases have a similar meaning and are used for emphasis. AT: "He will be a delight to all" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
