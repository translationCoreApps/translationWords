===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Even today my complaint is bitter** - Here "Even today" emphasizes that his friends arguments have not changed Job's situation at all. AT: "In spite of what you have said, my complaint is still bitter"
  * **my complaint is bitter** - Job speaks of his unanswered complaint against God as if it was a bitter taste in his mouth. AT: "my unanswered complaint is as bad as bitter food in my mouth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my hand ... heavy because of my groaning** - Possible meanings are 1) "I can barely lift my hand because of my suffering" or 2) "his hand continues to make me suffer despite my groaning" where "hand" refers to God's power to punish. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
