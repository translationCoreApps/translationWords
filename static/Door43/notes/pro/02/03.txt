===== translationNotes: =====

  * **If you cry out for understanding and raise your voice for it** - Both of these statements have the same meaning. It is implied that the person is strongly asking Yahweh for understanding. AT:  "If you urgently ask God and plead for understanding" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **If you cry ... if you seek** - This continues the series of conditional statements started in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:02:01|2:1]]. If you translated the statements in 1:1-2 as commands, you should translate these as commands also as in the UDB.
  * **raise your voice** - This is an idiom that means to speak loudly or to shout. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **if you seek it like you would seek silver and search for understanding as you would seek hidden treasures** - Both statements have the same meaning. These similes emphasize the great effort a person should make to understand what is wise. AT:  "if you seek understanding with as much effort as you search for a valuable object" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **you seek it ... search for understanding** - Trying very hard to understand what is wise is spoken of as if understanding were an object for which a person must search. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you will find the knowledge of God** - To succeed in knowing God is spoken of as if the knowledge of God were an object that a person finds after searching. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
