\v 11 But Naaman was angry and went away and said, "Look, I thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the place and heal my leprosy.
\v 12 Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Can I not bathe in them and be clean?" So he turned and went away in a rage.
