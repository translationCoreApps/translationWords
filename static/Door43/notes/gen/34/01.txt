===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - Here this word is used to mark a new part of the story.
  * **Dinah** - This is the name of Leah's daughter. See how you translated this name in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:30:19|30:21]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **the Hivite** - This is the name of a people group. See how you translated the similar word "Hivites" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:10:15|10:17]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **the prince of the land** - This is referring to Hamor not Shechem. Also, "prince" here does not mean son of a king. It means Hamor was the leader of the people in that area.
  * **He was drawn to Dinah** - "He was very attracted to her" (UDB). This speaks about Shechem loving Dinah and wanting to be with her as if something were forcing him to come to Dinah. This can be stated in active form. AT: "He wanted very much to be with Dinah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **spoke tenderly to her** - This means he spoke affectionately to convince her that he loved her and that he wanted her to love him also.
