====== Job 35 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

According to Elihu, instead of being punished for his sins, Job is sinning in the midst of these difficulties. This is the third of Elihu's four statements and it is addressed first to Job's friends and then to Job. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and  [[:en:obe:kt:witness]])


Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. Elihu uses many of Job's statements against him.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Ironic situation ==
Elihu explains the irony of Job's claim. He claimed to be righteous and desired Yahweh to intervene. In this chapter, Elihu explains to Job that his claims of righteousness are prideful. This makes him unrighteous. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]], [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]] and [[:en:obe:kt:unrighteous]])
