\v 41 Later Jesus said to them, "I will show you that when people say that the Messiah is only a descendant of King David, they are wrong!
\v 42 David himself wrote in the Book of Psalms about the Messiah, 
\q God said to my Lord,
\q 'Sit here beside me at my right, where I will highly honor you.
\q
\v 43 Sit here while I completely defeat your enemies.'
\p
\v 44 King David calls the Messiah 'my Lord'! So the Messiah cannot be just someone descended from King David! What I just said proves that he is much greater than David, right?"

\v 41 Jesus said to them, "How do they say that the Christ is David's son?
\v 42 For David himself says in the Book of Psalms, 
\q The Lord said to my Lord,
\q 'Sit at my right hand,
\q
\v 43 until I make your enemies your footstool.'
\m
\v 44 David therefore calls the Christ 'Lord', so how is he David's son?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus asks the scribes a question.

  * **How do they say ... son?** - "Why do they say ... son?" Jesus uses a question to make the scribes think about who the Messiah is. AT: "Let's think about them saying ... son." or "I will talk about them saying ... son" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **they say** - The prophets, the religious rulers, and the Jewish people in general knew that the Messiah was the son of David. AT: "everyone says" or "people say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **David's son** - "King David's descendant." The word "son" is used here to refer to a descendant. In this case it refers to the one who would reign over God's kingdom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **The Lord said to my Lord** - This is a quotation from the book of Psalms which says "Yahweh said to my Lord." But the Jews stopped saying "Yahweh" and often said "Lord" instead. AT: "The Lord God said to my Lord" or "God said to my Lord" 
  * **my Lord** - David was referring to the Christ as "my Lord."
  * **my right hand** - The right side is the place of honor. God was honoring the Messiah by telling him to sit in the place of honor on the throne beside God.
  * **until I make your enemies your footstool** - The Messiah's enemies are spoken of as if they were furniture on which he would rest his feet. This was an image of submission. AT: "until I make your enemies like a footstool for you" or "until I conquer your enemies for you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **David therefore calls the Christ 'Lord'** - In the culture of that time, a father was more respected than a son. David's us of the title 'Lord' for the Christ implies that he was greater than David. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **so how is he David's son?** - "so how can the Christ be David's son?" This can be a statement. AT: "this shows that the Christ is not merely David's descendant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
