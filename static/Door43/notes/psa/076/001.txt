===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]

  * **For the chief musician** - "This is for the director of music to use in worship"
  * **on stringed instruments** - "people should play stringed instruments with this song."
  * **A psalm of Asaph** - "This is a psalm that Asaph wrote." See how this is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:053:001|53:1]].
  * **made himself known in Judah** - "caused the people of Judah to know who he is" or "made himself famous in Judah"
  * **his name is great in Israel** - The words "his name" are a metonym for his reputation. AT: "the people of Israel consider him good and powerful"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **his dwelling place** - "where he has chosen to live"
  * **There he broke the arrows of the bow, the shield, the sword, and the other weapons of war** - These words are probably a metaphor for God causing the people of Judah to live in peace without being afraid of enemies making war on them, but the words should be translated literally if possible. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
