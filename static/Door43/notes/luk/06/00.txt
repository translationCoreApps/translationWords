====== Luke 06 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Luke 6:20-49 contains many blessings and woes which appear to correspond to Matthew 5-7. This par of Matthew has traditionally been called the "Sermon on the Mount." In Luke, they are not as connected to a teaching on the kingdom of God as they are in Matthew's gospel. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:kingdomofgod]]) 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Eating the grain" ==
This was a culturally acceptable practice for travelers to eat small amounts of grain off of plants in field they traveled through or near. Farmers were required to allow this according to the law of Moses. The Pharisees considered this to be "gleaning" and forbade it because they would be working on the Sabbath. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]], [[:en:obe:kt:works]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sabbath|Sabbath]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
It was common for Jesus to use metaphors as a way to teach people about complex spiritual truths. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

== Rhetorical Questions ==
Jesus used rhetorical questions to teach people and to condemn them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Implicit information ==
There are many instances of Luke including information that would have been implicitly understood by someone in the ancient Near East that may not be understood by someone in a different culture today. For example, the expectation of a time of judgment in the future or possibly that people will be judged at the end of their life ([[:en:bible:notes:luk:06:37|6:37]]). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== The twelve disciples ==
The following are the lists of the twelve disciples: In Matthew: Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.

In Mark: Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot,

In Luke: Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James, the son of Alphaeus, Simon, who was called the Zealot, Judas, the son of James, and Judas Iscariot,

It is probable that Thaddaeus and Jude, the son of James, are two names of the same person.
