\v 20 Pilate addressed them again, desiring to release Jesus.
\v 21 But they shouted, saying, "Crucify him, crucify him."
\v 22 He said to them a third time, "Why, what evil has this man done? I have found nothing deserving the death penalty in him. Therefore after punishing him, I will release him."
