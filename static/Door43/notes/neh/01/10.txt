<usfm>
\v 10 We are your servants. We are the people whom you brought back here by your very great power \f + \ft metonymy, doublet \f* \add from being exiled in Babylonia\add*.
\v 11 Yahweh, please hear this prayer of mine, and the prayers of all your people who are delighted to revere you \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Now I will go to the king, to request that he do me a great favor. Please motivate him to act kindly toward me, in order that I will be successful \add in obtaining what I want\add*."
\p At that time, I was the one whose work was to taste all the food and drink before it was served to the king, \add to be sure that no one had put poison in it\add*.

\v 10 We are your servants. We are the people whom you have delivered from slavery by your very great power. You did that because you are able to do whatever you desire.
\v 11 Yahweh, please hear my prayer, I who am your servant. Please hear the prayers of all your people who have great joy when they honor you for who you are and what you do. Now I pray you would give me success when I go to the king; and protect me as I make a request of the king that could put my life in jeopardy. Give me mercy."
\p I was serving as one of the most trusted servants to the king.

\v 10 Now they are your servants and your people, whom you have rescued by your great power and by your strong hand.
\v 11 Yahweh, I beg you, listen now to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight to honor your name. Now give success to your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man."
\p I served as cupbearer to the king.

  * **Now they are your servants** - The word "they" refers to the Israelites, and "your" refers to God.
  * **Now** - This word is used here to shift from words which God spoke to Moses to words which Nehemiah is speaking to God.

  * **to honor your name** - "to revere your name" OR "to lift up your reputation"
  * **grant him** - Nehemiah is referring to himself in the third person to express his humility before God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
