  * **you are very old** - Here "you" is plural and refers to Job and his three friends. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Length of days should speak; a multitude of years should teach wisdom** - These two lines mean the same thing. Elihu emphasizes that since older people are wiser than younger people, they should be the first to speak of what they know. AT: "He who has lived many years should speak; He would is older should teach wisdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
