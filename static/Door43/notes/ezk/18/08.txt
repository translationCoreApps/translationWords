<usfm>
\v 8 Then suppose that he does not charge any interest for loans, nor gains too much profit. Suppose that he carries out justice and establishes faithfulness between people.
\v 9 Suppose that he walks in my statutes and keeps my decrees to act faithfully. Then the promise for this righteous man is this: He will surely live!â€”this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
