===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Verse 8 is a continuation of the instructions Abraham gave his servant.

  * **But if the woman is not willing to follow you** - "But if the woman refuses to come with you." Abraham was answering the servant's question from [[:en:bible:notes:gen:24:05|24:5]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **you will be free from this oath of mine** - "you will be released from the oath you made to me." Not having to fulfill an oath is spoken of as if the person is free from an object to which he was bound. AT: "you will not have to do what you swore to me that you would do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master** - This was to show that he would certainly do what he was swearing to do. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **swore to him** - "made an oath to him"
  * **concerning this matter** - "concerning Abraham's request" or "that he would do what Abraham said"
