===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then it happened** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new message. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **in the twelfth year** - Possible meanings are 1) This happened in the twelfth year after the Babylonians took the Israelites to Babylon or 2) this happened in twelfth year after the Babylonians took Jehoiachin to Babylon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **bring them down—her and the daughters of majestic nations** - God is perhaps telling Ezekiel to cause this to happen by giving a prophetic command. 
  * **her** - Once again, the land of Egypt is referred to as a woman.
  * **the daughters of majestic nations** - Possible meanings are 1) "the people of powerful nations" or 2) "other powerful nations."
  * **the lowest earth** - "to the places under the ground." When people died, they were put in the ground. So "throw them down ... to the lowest earth" means "make them die." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **with those who have gone down to the pit** - "with everyone else who had died and gone into the ground"
  * **the pit** - "The pit" refers to the grave; because the grave was thought to be the entrance to the world of the dead, the pit also represents that world. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:31:16|31:16]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
