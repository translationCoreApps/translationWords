===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Godless people \add are like plants\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* that are watered before the sun rises;
\q2 their shoots spread all over the gardens.
\q1
\v 17 The roots of those plants twist around the piles of stones
\q2 and cling tightly to the rocks.
\q1
\v 18 But if those plants are pulled out,
\q2 \add it is as though\add* the place where they were planted says 'They were never here!'
\q2 \add And that is what happens to wicked people who do not heed what God says\add*.

\q
\v 16 Under the sun he is green,
\q and his shoots go out over his entire garden.
\q
\v 17 His roots are wrapped about the heaps of stone;
\q they look for good places among the rocks.
\q
\v 18 But if this person is destroyed out of his place,
\q then that place will deny him and say, 'I never saw you.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here pronouns "he" and "his" refer to the godless person who represents godless people in general. It may be helpful to readers to use the plural pronouns "they" and "their." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])

  * **Under the sun he is green, and his shoots go out over his entire garden** - Here Bildad compares the godless person to a plant that is healthy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Under the sun he is green** - The meaning of the Hebrew text is unclear. Possible meanings are 1) he is healthy during the day or 2) he is watered before the sun rises.
  * **His roots are wrapped about the heaps of stone ... they look for good places among the rocks** - These two phrases have similar meaning, but the meaning is unclear. Possible meanings are 1) he appears to be well-rooted in the rocks, taking advantage of every opening or 2) his roots cannot find fertile ground and must try to find nutrients among the rocks. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **if this person is destroyed out of his place** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "if someone pulls him out of his place" or "if a gardener tears him out of the garden" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **his place** - "the rocky ground" or "the garden"
  * **that place will deny him and say, 'I never saw you.'** - The garden is spoken of as if it had human ability to speak. The garden immediately forgets that he existed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
