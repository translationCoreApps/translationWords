God will send him\add* as \add he sent\add* me, \add and he will be\add* from among your own people. You must listen to everything that this prophet tells you \add and obey him\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f*.
\v 23 \add Those who\add* do not listen to \add that prophet and obey\add* him will no longer belong to God's people, and \add God\add* will get rid of them'."

\v 21 Jesus will certainly stay in heaven until the time when God will cause all that he has created to become new. Long ago God promised to do that, and he chose holy prophets to tell that to people.
\v 22 For example, the prophet Moses said this about the Messiah: 'The Lord your God will send a prophet like me from among you. You must listen to everything he says to you.
\v 23 Those who do not listen to that prophet and obey him will no longer belong to God's people, and God will destroy them.'"

\v 21 He is the One heaven must receive until the time of the restoration of all things, about which God spoke long ago by the mouth of his holy prophets.
\v 22 Moses indeed said, 'The Lord God will raise up a prophet like me from among your brothers. You shall listen to everything that he will speak to you.
\v 23 It will happen that every person who does not listen to that prophet will be completely destroyed from among the people.'
