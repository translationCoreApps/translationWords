\v 17 After Jesus had left the crowd, he entered a house with the disciples. They questioned him about the parable that he had just spoken.
\v 18 He replied to them, "Did you not understand what it means? You ought to understand that nothing that enters us from outside can cause God to consider us defiled.
\v 19 Instead of entering and ruining our minds, it goes into our stomachs, and afterwards the refuse passes out of our bodies." By saying this, Jesus was declaring that people can eat any food without causing God to consider them defiled.

\v 17 Now when Jesus left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable.
\v 18 Jesus said, "Are you also still without understanding? Do you not see that whatever enters into a person from outside cannot defile him,
\v 19 because it cannot go into his heart, but it goes into his stomach and then passes out into the latrine?" With this statement Jesus made all foods clean.
