\v 7 Then I heard God \f + \ft metonymy \f* commanding me, 'Peter, rise up, kill \add some of these\add*, and \add cook and\add* eat \add their meat\add*!'
\v 8 But I replied, 'Lord, \add you\f + \ft singular \f*\add* surely do not \add really want me to do that\add*, because I have never eaten \f + \ft metonymy \f* meat \add from any animal\add* that \add our laws say\add* that we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* must not eat \f + \ft synecdoche \f*!'
\v 9 God spoke from heaven \add to me\add* a second time, '\add I am\add* God, \add so\add* if I have made something acceptable \add to eat\add*, do not say that it is not acceptable \add to eat\add*!'
\v 10 Then \add after that happened three times, the sheet with\add* all \add those animals and birds\add* was pulled up into heaven again."

\v 7 Then I heard God commanding me, 'Peter, get up, kill and eat them!'
\v 8 But I replied, 'Lord, you surely do not really want me to do that, because I have never eaten anything that our laws say that we must not eat!'
\v 9 God spoke from heaven to me a second time, 'I am God, so if I have made something acceptable to eat, do not say it is unacceptable.'
\v 10 This same thing happened two more times, and then the sheet with all those animals and birds was pulled up into heaven again.

\v 7 Then I heard a voice say to me, "Get up, Peter; kill and eat!"
\v 8 I said, "Not so, Lord: for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth."
\v 9 But the voice answered again from heaven, "What God has declared clean, do not call unclean."
\v 10 This happened three times, and then everything was taken back up into heaven again.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I heard a voice** - The person speaking is not specified. The "voice" was probably God, although it could possibly have been an angel from God. See how you translated "a voice" in [[:en:bible:notes:act:10:13|10:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Not so** - "I will not do that." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:act:10:13|10:14]].
  * **nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth** - Apparently the animals in the sheet were animals which the Jewish law in the Old Testament forbade the Jews to eat. This can be said in a positive way. AT: "I have eaten only meat from holy and clean animals" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **unclean** - In the Old Testament Jewish law, a person became ritually "unclean" in various ways, such as eating certain forbidden animals.
  * **What God has declared clean, do not call unclean** - This refers to the animals in the sheet. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **This happened three times** - It is not likely that everything was repeated three times. This probably means that "What God has cleansed, do not call it defiled" was repeated three times. However, it may be best to simply say "This happened three times" instead of trying to explain in detail. See how you translated "This happened three times" in [[:en:bible:notes:act:10:13|10:16]].
