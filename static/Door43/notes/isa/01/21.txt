===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah speaks to the people of Judah in the form of a poem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **How the faithful city** - This exclamation shows Isaiah's anger and sadness about the people of Jerusalem. AT: "See how the people of Jerusalem, who had been faithful to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **has become a prostitute** - Isaiah compared the people to a woman who is not loyal to her husband but who sleeps with other men for money. The people were no longer loyal to God but were worshiping false gods. AT: "acts like a prostitute" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **She who was full of justice** - The word "she" refers to Jerusalem and its people. Those who wrote the Bible often refer to cities as women. AT: "The people of Jerusalem were fair and did what was right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **but now she is full of murderers** - The word "she" refers to Jerusalem and its people. Those who wrote the Bible often refer to cities as women. AT: "but now the people of Jerusalem are murderers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Your silver has become impure, your wine mixed with water** - Possible meanings are that Isaiah uses silver and wine as metaphors for 1) the people of Jerusalem. AT: "You are like silver that is no longer pure, and like wine that is mixed with water," or 2) the good deeds that the people formerly did. AT: "You used to do good deeds, but now your bad deeds make your good deeds worthless." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **silver ... impure** - Someone needs to clean silver often or it will no longer shine brightly.
  * **wine ... water** - Wine with water in it has little taste and so is no better than water.
