\v 5 Now Yahweh has spoken—he who formed me from birth to be his servant,
\q1 to restore Jacob again to himself, so that Israel would be gathered to him,
\q1 for I am honored in the eyes of Yahweh, and my God has become my strength—
\q1
\v 6 and he says, "It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to reestablish the tribes of Jacob,
\q1 and to restore the survivors of Israel. I will make you a light to the Gentiles,
\q1 that you may be my salvation to the ends of the earth."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh's servant continues speaking.

  * **that Israel would be gathered to him** - This part of the sentence means the same as the part before it. This can be stated in active form. AT: "to bring the people of Israel back to himself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I am honored in the eyes of Yahweh** - Here "eyes" represents Yahweh's thoughts or opinion. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh has honored me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **my God has become my strength** - God giving the servant strength is spoken of as if God himself were his strength. AT: "my God has given me strength" or "my God has strengthened me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will make you a light to the Gentiles** - The servant bringing Yahweh's message to the Gentiles and helping them to understand it is spoken of as if Yahweh made the servant a light that shines among the Gentiles. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:42:05|42:6]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to the ends of the earth** - The places on the earth that are very far away are spoken of as if they were the places where the earth ends. This phrase also forms a merism and refers to everywhere in between the ends. AT "to all the farthest places of the earth" or "to the entire earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
