\v 19 They repeatedly struck his head with a reed and spat on him. They knelt down in front of him to pretend to honor him.
\v 20 When they had finished mocking him, they pulled off the purple robe. They put his own clothes on him, and then they led him outside of the city in order to nail him to a cross.
\p
\v 21 Now a man named Simon from Cyrene came along. He was the father of Alexander and Rufus, and he was passing by Jesus on his way to the city from somewhere else. The soldiers compelled Simon to carry the cross for Jesus.
