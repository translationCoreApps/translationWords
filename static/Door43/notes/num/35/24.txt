\v 24 That law is that the people of that city must decide whether the relative of the dead person has the right to get revenge, or whether the one who killed the other person truly did it accidentally.
\v 25 If they decide that the killer planned to kill the other person, they must not allow him to stay in their city. But if they decide that it was done accidentally, they must protect the killer from being killed by the dead person's relative. They must send the killer to one of the cities where he will be safe, and allow him to stay there until the high priest dies. After that, the killer may go back to his home, because the dead person's relative no longer has the right to get revenge.

\v 24 In that case, the community must judge between the accused and the blood avenger on the basis of these rules.
\v 25 The community must rescue the accused from the blood avenger's power. The community must return the accused to the city of refuge to which he had originally fled. He must live there until the death of the current high priest, the one who was anointed with the holy oil.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the blood avenger** - Here the word "blood" is a metonym for the murder. Translate these words in the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:num:35:19|35:19]]. AT: "The one who avenges the murder" or "The relative seeking vengeance" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The community must rescue the accused** - This means if the community judges that the death was accidental then they must save the accused man from the relative who wants to kill him. If the community judges that the death was not accidental, then the relative must execute the accused man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the one who was anointed with the holy oil** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the one you anointed with holy oil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
