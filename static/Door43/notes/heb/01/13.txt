<usfm>
\v 13 God has never said to any angel what he said to his Son:
\q "Sit in the most important place next to me and rule with me
\q while I defeat all of your enemies for you to rule over them!"
\p
\v 14 The angels are only spirits whom God has sent out to serve and care for believers whom God will soon save completely, as he has promised to do for them.

\p
\v 13 But to which of the angels has God said at any time,
\q "Sit at my right hand
\q until I make your enemies a stool for your feet"?
\p
\v 14 Are not all angels spirits who serve, and who are sent to care for those who will inherit salvation?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This quotation comes from another Psalm.

  * **But to which of the angels has God said at any time ... feet"?** - The author uses a question to emphasize that God has never said this to an angel. AT: "But God has never said to an angel at any time ... feet.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Sit at my right hand** - Here "right hand" refers to a place of honor. AT: "Sit next to me in the place of honor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **until I make your enemies a stool for your feet** - Christ's enemies are spoken of as if they will become an object on which a king rests his feet. This image represents defeat and dishonor for his enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Are not all angels spirits ... inherit salvation?** - The author uses this question to remind the readers that angels are not as powerful as Christ, but they have a different role. AT: "All angels are spirits who ... inherit salvation." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **for those who will inherit salvation** - Receiving what God has promised believers is spoken of as if it were inheriting property and wealth from a family member. AT: "for those whom God will save" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
