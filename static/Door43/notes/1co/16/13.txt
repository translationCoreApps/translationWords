===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Be watchful, stand fast in the faith, act like men, be strong** - Paul is describing what he wants the Corinthians to do as if he was giving four commands to soldiers in war. These four commands mean almost the same thing and are used for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Be watchful** - Paul speaks of people being aware of what is happening as if they were guards keeping watch over a city or vineyard. This can be stated more clearly. AT: "Be careful whom you trust" or "Watch out for danger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **stand fast in the faith** - Paul speaks of people continuing to believe in Christ according to his teaching as if they were soldiers refusing to retreat when the enemy attacks. Possible meanings are 1) "keep strongly believing what we have taught you" or 2) "keep strongly trusting in Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **act like men** - In the society in which Paul and his audience lived, men usually provided for families by doing the heavy work and fighting against invaders. This can be stated more clearly. AT: "be responsible" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Let all that you do be done in love** - "Everything you do should show people that you love them"
