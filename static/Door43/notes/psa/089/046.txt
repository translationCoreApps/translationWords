===== translationNotes: =====

  * **How long, Yahweh? Will you hide yourself, forever?** - The writer uses these questions to emphasize that he does not want God to continue to refuse the king. AT: "Please, Yahweh, do not refuse to help the king forever." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Will you hide yourself** - God not helping the king is spoken of as if God were hiding from him. AT: "Will you refuse to help the king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **How long will your anger burn like fire?** - The writer uses a question to emphasize that he does not want God to remain angry. AT: "Please do not continue being angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **your anger burn like fire** - God being very angry is spoken of as if his anger were a hot fire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **for what uselessness you have created all the children of mankind** - The abstract noun "uselessness" can be stated as "uselessly." AT: "that you have created all people to die uselessly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the children of mankind** - This refers to humans in general. AT: "humans" or "people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
  * **Who can live and not die, or rescue his own life from the hand of Sheol?** - The writer uses these questions to emphasize that all people will die. AT: "No one can live forever or bring himself back to life after dying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **rescue his own life from the hand of Sheol** - Here "hand" refers to power. The writer speaks of Sheol as if it were a person who has power over those who die. Possible meanings are 1) a person cannot bring himself back to life after dying or 2) a person cannot keep himself from dying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
