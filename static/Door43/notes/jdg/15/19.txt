  * **Lehi** - Translate this the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:15:09|15:9]]
  * **his strength returned and he revived** - These two phrase mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Samson became strong again. These two statements can be combined. AT: "he became strong again" or "he was revived" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **En Hakkore** - This is the name of a spring of water. The name means "spring of him who prayed." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **it is at Lehi to this day** - This means that the spring did not dry up but that it remained. The phrase "to this day" refers to the "present" time. AT: "the spring can still be found at Lehi, even today" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **in the days of the Philistines** - This refers to the time period that the Philistines controlled the land of Israel. AT: "during the time the Philistines controlled Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
