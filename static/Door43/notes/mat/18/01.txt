<usfm>
\v 1 About that time we disciples approached Jesus and said, "Who \add among us will be\add* the most important when God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] \add makes you\add* king?"
\v 2 Jesus called a child to come, and he placed that child in our midst.
\v 3 He said, "Think about this: If you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* do not change \add the way you\f + \ft plural \f* think\add* and become \add as humble\add* as little children, you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* will surely not go to the place where God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] rules.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is the beginning of a new part of the story that runs through [[:en:bible:notes:mat:18:34|18:35]], where Jesus teaches about life in the kingdom of heaven. Here, Jesus uses a little child to teach the disciples.

  * **Who is greatest** - "Who is the most important" or "Who among us will be the most important" (UDB)
  * **in the kingdom of heaven** - The phrase "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. This phrase is used only in the book of Matthew. If possible, keep "heaven" in your translation. AT: "in God's kingdom" or "when our God in heaven establishes his rule on earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Truly I say to you** - "I tell you the truth." This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **unless you turn ... you will in no way enter** - This can be stated in positive form. AT: "you must change ... in order to enter" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **become like little children** - Jesus uses a simile to teach the disciples that they should not be concerned with who is most important. They should be concerned with becoming humble like a child. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **enter the kingdom of heaven** - The phrase "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. This phrase is used only in the book of Matthew. If possible, keep "heaven" in your translation.
