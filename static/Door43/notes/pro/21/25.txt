===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The desire of the lazy kills him** - The writer speaks of what a person wants as if it were a person who could kill a lazy person. Here the lazy person wants to be idle and not work. AT: "A lazy person only wants to be idle, and because of that he will die" or "A lazy person will die because he does not want to work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **his hands refuse** - The hand is a synecdoche for the person. AT: "he refuses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **craves** - "wants greatly" or "desires strongly"
  * **gives and does not hold back** - The phrase "does not hold back" can be stated positively, and what he gives can be made explicit. AT: "gives everything he should" or "gives generously" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
