<usfm>
\v 13 God will not very easily stop being angry;
\q2 he defeated \f + \ft metonymy \f* those who \add tried to\add* help Rahab, \add the great sea monster\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 14 So, \add if God took me to court\add*,
\q2 what could I say \f + \ft metonymy \f* to answer him?
\q1
\v 15 Even though I would be innocent\f + \ft Or: would not have done what is wrong \f*, I would not be able to answer him.
\q2 All I could do would be to request God, my judge\f + \ft Or: accuser \f*, to act mercifully toward me.

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 God will not withdraw his anger;
\q the helpers of Rahab bow beneath him.
\q
\v 14 How much less could I answer him,
\q could I choose words to reason with him?
\q
\v 15 Even if I were righteous, I could not answer him;
\q I could only plead for mercy with my judge.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the helpers of Rahab bow beneath him** - Here "bow beneath him" symbolizes submission or defeat. AT: "he crushes the helpers of Rahab" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **Rahab** - The word "Rahab" here refers to a monster of the sea. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **How much less could I answer him, could I choose words to reason with him?** - Job poses two similar questions to emphasize his reluctance to confront God. They can be reworded as a statement. AT: "So I certainly could not answer him or choose words to reason with him."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
