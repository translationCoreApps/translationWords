===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul gives instructions to make believers strong in this battle we live for God.

  * **the strength of his might** - "his great power." See how "the strength of his power" is translated near the end of  [[:en:bible:notes:eph:01:19|1:21]].
  * **Put on the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the scheming plans of the devil** - Christians should use all the resources God gives to stand firmly against the devil just as a soldier puts on armor to protect himself from enemy attacks. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the scheming plans** - "the tricky plans"
