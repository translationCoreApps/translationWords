===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 To others, the same Spirit gives the ability to believe \add that God will work miracles\add*. To others, the Spirit gives the ability to heal \add sick people\add*.
\v 10 To others, he gives the power \add to perform\add* miracles. To others, he gives the ability to speak messages that come directly from God. To others, he gives the ability to tell \add if a message is really from God or not\add*. To others he gives the ability to speak messages in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add*. To others, he gives the ability to tell the meaning of those messages \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 11 It is the same one Spirit who gives all these abilities. He gives whatever abilities he wants to give, to whatever person he wants to give them.

\v 9 To another believer the Spirit gives the gift of trusting God for wonderful things. To still another person he gives the ability to pray to God for him to heal people.
\v 10 The Spirit makes some believers able to do powerful deeds so that people will praise God. As for certain other believers, he makes them able to speak messages from God. The Spirit makes still other believers able to tell spirits who honor God from spirits who do not. To still others, the Spirit gives various kinds of languages in which to speak messages from God, and he makes others able to interpret those messages into our language.
\v 11 Again and again we see the many different gifts, but it is the same Spirit who gives these gifts to individuals, as he chooses.

<usfm>
\v 9 To another is given faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit.
\v 10 To another is given deeds of power, and to another prophecy. To another is given the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.
\v 11 But the one and the same Spirit works in all of these, giving the gifts to each one individually, as he chooses.
