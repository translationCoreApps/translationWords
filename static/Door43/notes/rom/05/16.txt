\v 16 And \add there is another way in which God's\add* freely \add erasing the record of our sins\add* is not like \add the results of Adam's\add* sinning. One person, \add Adam, sinned\add*. As a result, God declared that all people deserve to be punished. Many people sinned. But what God did was that he erased the record of their sins without their earning it.
\v 17 All people die \f + \ft metaphor, personification \f* because of what one man, \add Adam\add*, did. But now many of us experience that God has abundantly acted towards us in ways we did not deserve, and we experience that he has erased the record of our sins without our earning it. It is also very certain that we will rule \add with Christ\add* \f + \ft Or: share \add the glory\add* of Christ's being king \f*, \add in heaven. This will happen\add* because of \add what\add* one man, Jesus Christ, \add did for us\add*.

\v 16 And there is another way in which God's gift is different from Adam's sin. Because Adam sinned, all people after him have sinned, and so God declared that all people deserve to be punished. But as a kind gift, God offers to put us right with himself.
\v 17 All people die because of what one man, Adam, did. But now many of us experience that God has kindly given us a very great giftâ€”which we do not deserve: he has put us right with himself. It is also very certain that we will rule with Christ in heaven. This will happen because of what one man, Jesus Christ, did for us.

\v 16 For the gift is not like the outcome of the one who sinned. For on the one hand, the judgment of condemnation came because of the trespass of one man. But on the other hand, the free gift resulting in justification came after many trespasses. 
\v 17 For if, by the trespass of one, death ruled through the one, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness rule through the life of the one, Jesus Christ.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For the gift is not like the outcome of the one who sinned** - Here "the gift" refers to God's freely erasing the record of our sins. AT: "The gift is not like the result of Adam's sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **For on the one hand, the judgment of condemnation came because of the trespass of one man. But on the other hand** - Here Paul gives two reasons why "the gift is not like the result of Adam's sin." The phrases "For on the one hand" and "but on the other hand" introduce two different ways of thinking about something. The "judgment of condemnation" implies that we all deserve God's punishment for our sins. AT: "Because on the one hand, God declared that all people deserve to be punished because of the sin of one man, but on the other hand" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the free gift resulting in justification** - This refers to how God makes us right with him even when we do not deserve it. AT: "God's kind gift to put us right with himself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **after many trespasses** - "after the sins of many"
  * **trespass of one** - This refers to the sin of Adam.
  * **death ruled** - Here Paul speaks of "death" as a king who ruled. The "rule" of death causes everyone to die. AT: "everyone died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **life of the one** - This refers to the life of Jesus Christ.
