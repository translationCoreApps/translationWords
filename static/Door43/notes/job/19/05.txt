===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Job continues to speak to his three friends.

  * **If indeed you will exalt yourselves above me** - "If you think you are better than I am" or "Since you act as though you are better than I am" 
  * **and use my humiliation against me** - How they would do this can be stated clearly. AT: "and claim that my humiliation is proof against me" or "and use my humiliation as evidence that I am guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **use my humiliation against me** - The abstract noun "humiliation" can be expressed with the verb humiliate. AT: "claim that what has happened to humiliate me proves that I am guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **has caught me in his net** - Job speaks as if God were a hunter that has trapped Job in his net. This metaphor represents God taking control of Job and Job's feeling of helplessness. AT: "has trapped me" or "has taken control of me" or "has control of what happens to me, so that I am helpless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
