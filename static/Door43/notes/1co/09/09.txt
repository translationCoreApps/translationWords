\v 9 Moses wrote in one of those laws, "While an ox is threshing\add grain\add*, you must not tie its mouth shut \add so that it cannot eat the grain\add*." God was not only concerned about oxen \add when he gave that law\add*.\f + \ft Or: Was God \add only\add* concerned about oxen \add when he gave that law\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 10 \add No\add*, he was \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* concerned about us, also! Yes, \add God caused Moses to\add* write those words \add because he is concerned\add* about us! Those who plow the ground confidently expect \add to eat some of\add* the crop \add that grows\add*. Those who thresh grain confidently expect \add to eat some of the grain that they thresh. Similarly, we who proclaim the message about Christ have the right to confidently expect to receive financial help for our work\add*.
\v 11 And because we have proclaimed God's message to you, we certainly have the right to receive from you the things that we need for our bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f*!\f + \ft Or: do we not have the right to receive from you the things that we need for our bodies? \f* \f + \ft metaphor, rhetorical question \f*

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 For the law of Moses says, "When an ox is treading out the grain, do not stop it from eating some of it." There is more that God is concerned about in this law.
\v 10 This law is about us. Moses is saying that those who work in any job should benefit from the fruit of that work, just like the ox eating the grain on which he is treading.
\v 11 If we have sown the seed of the good news to you, is it too much for us to receive money from you in our support?

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 For it is written in the law of Moses, "Do not put a muzzle on an ox when it is treading out the grain." Is it really the oxen that God cares about?
\v 10 Is he not speaking about us? It was written for us, because the one who plows should plow in hope, and the one who threshes should thresh in the expectation of sharing in the harvest.
\v 11 If we sowed spiritual things among you, is it too much for us to reap material things from you?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do not put** - Moses was speaking to the Israelites as if they were one person, so this command is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Is it really the oxen that God cares about?** - Paul asks a question so that the Corinthians will think of what he is saying without him having to say it. AT: "You should know without me telling you that it is not the oxen that God cares most about." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Is he not speaking about us?** - Paul asks a question to emphasize the statement he is making. AT: "Instead, God was certainly speaking about us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **about us** - Here "us" refers to Paul and Barnabas. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **is it too much for us to reap material things from you?** - Paul asks a question so that the Corinthians will think of what he is saying without him having to say it. AT: "you should know without me telling you that  it is not too much for us to receive material support from you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
