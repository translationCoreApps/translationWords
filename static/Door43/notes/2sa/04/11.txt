\v 11 So because you two evil men have murdered a man who did nothing wrongâ€”and you killed him when he was sleeping on his bed in his own house, I will do something worse to you. I will surely get revenge on you two for murdering him, and wipe you off from the earth!"

\v 11 How much more, when wicked men have killed an innocent person in his own house on his bed, should I not now require his blood from your hand, and remove you from the earth?"
\v 12 Then David gave orders to the young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hung them up beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **How much more ... should I not now require his blood from your hand, and remove you from the earth?** - This question is used to show that the men had committed an especially serious crime. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "You are even more guilty! It is my duty to require his blood from your hand and to remove you from the earth." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **require his blood from your hand** - The phrase "his blood" represents the life of Ishbosheth. Here "from your hand" represents Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, introduced in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:04:05|4:5]]. AT: "hold you responsible for the death of Ishbosheth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **cut off their hands and feet and hung them up** - These were symbolic actions to show contempt for the men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the grave** - This was a symbolic act to honor Ishbosheth. This could be stated explicitly. AT: "they honored Ishbosheth by burying his head in the grave" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
