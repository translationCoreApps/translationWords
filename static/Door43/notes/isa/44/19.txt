<usfm>
\q1
\v 19 No one thinks, nor do they comprehend and say,
\q1 "I have burned part of the wood in the fire; yes,
I have also baked bread upon its coals. I have roasted meat over its coals and eaten.
\q1 Now should I make the other part of the wood into something disgusting to worship? Should I bow down to a block of wood?"

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Now should I make ... something disgusting to worship? Should I bow down to a block of wood?** - Yahweh says that these people should be asking themselves these rhetorical questions. The questions anticipate negative answers and emphasize how foolish it would be for a person to do these things. These questions can be translated as statements. AT: "I should not now make ... something disgusting to worship. I should not bow down to a block of wood." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
