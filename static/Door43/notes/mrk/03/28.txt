\v 28 Truly I say to you, all sins of the sons of men will be forgiven, even all the blasphemies which they utter,
\v 29 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never have forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin."
\v 30 Jesus said this because they were saying, "He has an unclean spirit."
