\v 12 In these tasks I suffer, but I am not ashamed, because I know and have trusted Jesus Christ, and I am convinced that he is able to protect my faith in him until the final day.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 For this cause I also suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed. I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have entrusted to him until that day.
\v 13 Keep the example of faithful messages that you heard from me, with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
\v 14 The good thing that God committed to you, guard it through the Holy Spirit, who lives in us.
