====== Leviticus 22:14-16 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 If anyone who is not permitted to eat a sacred offering eats it without realizing that it is sacred, he must pay the priest for the offering, and pay him an extra one-fifth of its value.
\v 15 When the priests bring offerings to me, the sacred offerings that the Israelite people bring to them, they must not treat those offerings as though they are not sacred
\v 16 by allowing those who are not priests to eat any of those offerings. If they did that, they would become guilty and must make a payment. I am Yahweh, the one who causes those offerings to be sacred."

\v 16 the people must not allow anyone who is not a priest to eat any of those offerings. If they did that, they would become guilty. I am Yahweh, the one who sets the Israelite people apart from other people and makes them holy for my honor."

\v 14 If a man eats a holy food without knowing it, then he must repay the priest for it; he must add one-fifth to it and give it back to the priest.

\v 15 The people of Israel must not dishonor the holy things that they have raised high and presented to Yahweh,
\v 16 and cause themselves to carry the sin that would make them guilty of eating the holy food, for I am Yahweh who makes them holy.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he must repay the priest for it; he must add one-fifth to it** - Possible meanings are 1) that the person had to replace the food that he had eaten with the same kind of food or 2) that the person had to pay money to the priest for the food that he had eaten.
  * **one-fifth** - This is one part out of five equal parts. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]])
  * **must not dishonor the holy things** - This can be stated in positive form. AT: "must treat the holy things with honor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **that they have raised high and presented** - The phrase "raised high" refers to a symbolic gesture of respect that represents offering something to Yahweh. It means basically the same thing as "presented." AT: "that they have offered" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **cause themselves to carry the sin that would make them guilty** - Sin is spoken of as if it were an object that people can carry. Possible meanings are 1) they would be responsible for the sin and so become guilty. AT: "they would be guilty for the sin that they committed" or 2) the word "sin" is a metonym for punishment for the sin that they committed. AT: "they would receive the punishment because they are guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
