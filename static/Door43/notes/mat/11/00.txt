====== Matthew 11 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of [[:en:bible:notes:mat:11:09|11:10]], which is a quotation from the Old Testament, and [[:en:bible:notes:mat:11:16|11:17]].

Some scholars believe that [[:en:bible:notes:mat:11:20|11:20]] begins a new stage in the ministry of Christ because of Israel's rejection of him. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Hidden revelation ==

After [[:en:bible:notes:mat:11:20|11:20]], Jesus begins to reveal information about himself and about the plans of God the Father, while hiding this information from those who reject him. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:mat:11:25|11:25]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "The kingdom of heaven is near" ==

This phrase has great theological significance. Scholars often debate whether the "kingdom of heaven" was present at this time or still coming. English translations frequently use the phrase "at hand," but this can create difficulty in translating. Other translations use the phase "is coming near" and "has come near."
