\v 8 This is also what Yahweh the Lord says: "The people of Moab \add south of Ammon\add* and the people of Seir \add south of Moab despised Israel and\add* said, 'The people \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Israel have become \add as unimportant\add* as all the other nations!'
\v 9 Therefore, I will destroy the cities that protect the borders of Moab, starting at Beth-Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon, and Kiriathaim, the finest cities in Moab.
\v 10 I will enable people from the east to conquer Moab and also to conquer Ammon. As the result, just like \add I will cause that\add* Ammon will no longer be remembered by other nations,
\v 11 I will also punish the people of Moab. When that happens, people will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*."

\v 8 The Lord Yahweh says this, 'Because Moab and Seir say, "Behold! The house of Judah is like every other nation."
\v 9 Therefore, behold! I will open the slopes of Moab, starting at his cities on the border—the splendor of Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiraiathaim—
\v 10 to the people of the east who have been against the people of Ammon. I will give them up as a possession so that the people of Ammon will not be remembered among the nations.
\v 11 So I will perform judgments against Moab, and they will know that I am Yahweh.'

  * **The house of Judah is** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the descendants of Judah over many years. Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "The Judah people group are" or "The people of Judah are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **starting at his cities** - Here the city of Moab is spoken of as with the masculine pronoun "his." AT: "starting at its cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])

  * **to the people of the east who have been against the people of Ammon** - "I will send the same army from the people in the east who attacked Ammon"
  * **I will give them up as a possession** - Here Yahweh speaks of allowing the armies from the east to conquer Ammon as if Ammon were a possession that he were giving them. AT: "I will allow the armies to conquer them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
