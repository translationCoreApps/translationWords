\v 17 Moses and Aaron took these men, who were recorded by name,
\v 18 and along with these men they assembled all the men of Israel on the first day of the second month. Then each man twenty years old and older identified his ancestry. He had to name the clans and families descended from his ancestors.
\v 19 Then Moses recorded their numbers in the wilderness of Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him to do.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **took these men** - "gathered these men together"
  * **who were recorded by name** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "whose names they had recorded" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the first day of the second month** - "the 1st day of the 2nd month." This is the second month of the Hebrew calendar. The first day is near the middle of April on Western calendars. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:num:01:01|1:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **Then each man ... identified his ancestry. He had to name the clans and families descended from his ancestors** - The second sentence means basically the same thing as the first and is added for clarification. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He had to name** - Here "name" means to "say." AT: "Each man had to say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
