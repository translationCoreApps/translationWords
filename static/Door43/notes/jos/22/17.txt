====== Joshua 22:17-18 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Have you forgotten what happened at Peor, \add when some Israelites sinned by worshiping the god that the Moab people-group worship\add*? Many Israelites became very sick and died because of that sin, and we are still suffering because of their sin.
\v 18 Are you now turning away from obeying Yahweh and refusing to do what he wants? If you do not stop right now rebelling against Yahweh today, he will be angry with all of us Israelites tomorrow.'

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Have you forgotten about how Yahweh punished us at Peor, when we turned away from him and worshiped other gods? Yahweh sent a deadly sickness among the people of Israel, and many died from it.
\v 18 Have you, too, turned away from following Yahweh by building this altar? Since you have rebelled like this against him, Yahweh will be angry with all the people of Israel.'

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Was our sin at Peor not enough for us? Yet we have not even now cleansed ourselves from it. For that sin there came a plague on the assembly of Yahweh.
\v 18 Must you also turn away from following Yahweh at this present day? If you also rebel against Yahweh today, tomorrow he will be angry with the whole assembly of Israel.
