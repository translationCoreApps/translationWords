===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 When I do these things, this is to show that the people of Israel will live for a long time and not have any king ruling over them. They will have no prince, no sacrifices or pillars set up for worship, ephods or idols in their houses.
\v 5 After some time, the people of Israel will return to Yahweh; they will hope that he will receive them back. They will hope to have a descendant of David for their king again. In the later time, they will come to Yahweh to honor him and tremble before him because of his goodness to them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 For the people of Israel will live for many days without a king, prince, sacrifice, stone pillar, ephod or household idols.
\v 5 Afterward the people of Israel will return and seek Yahweh their God and David their king. And in the last days, they will come trembling before Yahweh and his goodness.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For the people of Israel will live for many days without a king, prince, sacrifice, stone pillar, ephod or household idols** - Just as Hosea lived without his wife because she committed adultery, Israel will live without a king and without worshiping God, because they committed idolatry.
  * **David their king** - Here "David" represents all the descendants of David. AT: "a descendant of David to be their king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in the last days** - "in the future"
  * **seek Yahweh their God** - Here "seek" means to ask God to accept them and their worship.
  * **they will come trembling before Yahweh and his goodness** - Here "trembling" represents feelings of awe and humility. AT: "they will come back to Yahweh and will humble themselves, honor him, and ask for his blessings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
