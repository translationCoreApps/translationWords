  * **General Information:** - There is a shift here to the second person. This may mean 1) the writer begins speaking to the people of Israel or 2) the writer is quoting another person speaking to the writer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])

  * **your foot to slip** - The slipping of a foot is associated with falling. AT: "you to fall" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he who protects ... the guardian** - These two phrases means the same thing, and emphasize God's role as a protector. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **he who protects you will not slumber** - Here to "slumber" means he would stop protecting. The negative form strengthens the statement. AT: "God will not fall asleep and stop protecting you" or "God will always protect you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
