\v 52 Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its sheath! All those who try to kill others with a swordâ€”someone else will kill them with a sword!
\v 53 Do you think that if I asked my Father, he would not immediately send more than twelve armies of angels to help me?
\v 54 But if I did that, what the prophets have written in the scriptures about what will happen to the Messiah would not be fulfilled."

\v 51 Behold, one of those who was with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
\v 52 Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.
\v 53 Do you think that I could not call upon my Father, and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels?
\v 54 But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled, that this must happen?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Behold** - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **who take up the sword** - The implied information can be stated explicitly. AT: "who pick up a sword to kill others" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **will perish by the sword** - "will die by means of the sword" or "it is with the sword that someone will kill them"
  * **Do you think that I could not call ... angels?** - Jesus uses a question to remind the person with the sword that Jesus could stop those who are arresting him. AT: "Surely you know that I could call ... angels" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do you think** - Here "you" is singular and refers to the person with the sword. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **my Father** - This is an important title for God that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **more than twelve legions of angels** - The word "legion" is a military term that refers to a group of about 6,000 soldiers. Jesus means God would send enough angels to easily stop those who are arresting Jesus. The exact number of angels is not important. AT: "more than 12 really large groups of angels" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled, that this must happen?** - Jesus uses a question to explain why he is letting these people arrest him. This can be stated in active form. AT: "But if I did that, I would not be able to fulfill what God said in the scriptures must happen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
