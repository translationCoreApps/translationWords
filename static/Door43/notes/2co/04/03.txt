====== 2 Corinthians 04:3-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 And if, \add as some of you say, some people are\add* not able to understand the message \add that we teach about Christ, it is not because we do not teach it clearly\add*. It is because those people \add do not want to believe it\add*. They are on the road to eternal death.
\v 4 \add Satan, who is\add* the one \add who rules\add* this world, controls the thoughts of those unbelievers. He prevents them from understanding the message about how wonderful Christ is. \add They are not able to understand that\add* Jesus is like God \add in every way\add*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 If the good news is hidden with a veil, it is hidden from those who are dying apart from God.
\v 4 For them, the god of this world has made them blind to the truth because they do not trust the good news about the wonderful honor of Christâ€”for it is Christ who shows us what God is like.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing.
\v 4 In their case, the god of this world has blinded their unbelieving minds. As a result, they are not able to see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing** - This refers back to [[:en:bible:notes:2co:03:14|3:14-16]], where Paul explained that there is a spiritual veil that prevents people from understanding when they read the old covenant. In the same way, people are not able to understand the gospel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "if a veil covers our gospel, that veil covers it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **our gospel** - "the gospel that we preach"
  * **the god of this world has blinded their unbelieving minds** - Paul speaks of their minds as if they had eyes, and their inability to understand as their minds being unable to see. AT: "the god of this world has prevented unbelievers from understanding" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the god of this world** - "the god who rules this world." This phrase refers to Satan.
  * **they are not able to see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ** - As the Israelites could not see God's glory that shined on Moses' face because he covered it with a veil (see [[:en:bible:notes:2co:03:12|3:13]]), unbelievers are not able to see Christ's glory that shines in the gospel. This means that they are unable to understand "the gospel of the glory of Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the light of the gospel** - "the light that comes from the gospel"
  * **the gospel of the glory of Christ** - "the gospel about the Christ's glory"
