===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He makes the deep to foam up like a pot of boiling water** - "As he passes through the water, he leaves a trail of bubbles behind him, like the bubbling of boiling water in a pot"
  * **he makes the sea like a pot of ointment** - The ointment in a pot is cloudy if someone shakes it, and the sea is muddy when Leviathan swims in it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **one would think the deep had gray hair** - because the bubbles in his wake are white
