AT: "Make me acceptable by sprinkling water on me with hyssop" or "Forgive me for my sins so that I will be acceptable to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **hyssop** - This is a plant that the priests used to sprinkle water or blood on people or things to make them ceremonially clean, that is, acceptable to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
