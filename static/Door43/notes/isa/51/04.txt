===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh speaks to the people of Israel.

  * **Be attentive to me ... listen to me** - These two phrases mean the same thing. Together they strengthen the command to listen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I will make my justice to be a light for the nations** - Here God's justice represents his law, and a light represents knowledge of what is right.

  * **my salvation will go out** - God speaks of saving people as if his salvation were a thing that could go out to them. AT: "I will save people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my arm will judge the nations** - Here God's arm represents his power, and judging represents ruling. AT: "I will rule the nations with my power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the coastlands** - This refers to the people who live on the coasts of distant lands across the sea. AT: "the people who live on the coastlands" or "the people who live in the the lands across the sea" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for my arm they will eagerly wait** - Here God's arm represents what he will do. Here it refers to him saving people. AT: "they will eagerly wait for me to do something" or "they will eagerly wait for me to save them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
