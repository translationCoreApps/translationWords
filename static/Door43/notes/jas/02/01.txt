====== James 02:1-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 My fellow believers, \add because\add* you trust our Lord Jesus Christ, the one who is glorious\f + \ft Or: wonderful \f*, stop honoring some people more than others.
\v 2 \add For example\add*, suppose that a person who wears gold rings and fine clothes enters your meeting place. Then suppose that a poor person who wears shabby\f + \ft Or: ragged \f* clothes also comes in.
\v 3 And \add suppose\add* that you show special attention to\f + \ft Or: treat better \f* the one who is dressed in fine clothes by saying, "Sit here in this good seat!" and you say to the poor one, "Stand there or sit on the floor \f + \ft metonymy \f*!"
\v 4 Then you have obviously \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* caused divisions in the congregation \f + \ft Or: you are clearly treating one better than the others, and you are using evil \add motives( Or: reasons )\add* to \add evaluate people\f + \ft Or: decide whether people are important or not\add* \f* \f*.

<usfm>
\v 1 My brothers and sisters, do not think of honoring some people more than others as you at the same time trust in our Lord Jesus Christ, the one who is greater than anything.
\v 2 For example, suppose that a person who wears gold rings and fine clothes enters your meeting place. Then suppose that a poor person who wears shabby clothes also comes in.
\v 3 And suppose that you show special attention to the one dressed in fine clothes by saying, "Please sit here in this nice seat!" and you say to the poor one, "You stand over there or sit on the floor!"
\v 4 You have then judged one another for wrong reasons.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 My brothers, do not hold to faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with favoritism toward certain people.
\v 2 Suppose that someone enters your meeting wearing gold rings and fine clothes, and there also enters a poor man in dirty clothes.
\v 3 If you look at the person wearing fine clothes and say, "Please sit here in a nice place," but you say to the poor man, "You stand over there," or, "Sit at my feet,"
\v 4 are you not judging among yourselves? Have you not become judges with evil thoughts?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - James continues to tell the scattered Jewish believers how to live by loving one another and reminds them not to favor rich people over poor brothers.

  * **My brothers** - James considers his audience to be Jewish believers. AT: "My fellow believers" or "My brothers and sisters in Christ"
  * **hold to faith in our Lord Jesus Christ** - Believing in Jesus Christ is spoken of as if it were an object that one could hold onto. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **our Lord Jesus Christ** - The word "our" includes James and his fellow believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **favoritism toward certain people** - the desire to help some people more than others
  * **Suppose that someone** - James starts to describe a situation where the believers might give more honor to a rich person than to a poor person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **wearing gold rings and fine clothes** - "dressed like a wealthy person"
  * **sit here in a nice place** - to sit in this place of honor
  * **stand over there** - to move to a place with less honor
  * **Sit at my feet** - to move to a humble place
  * **are you not judging among yourselves? Have you not become judges with evil thoughts?** - James is using rhetorical questions to teach and possibly scold his readers. AT: "You are making judgments among yourselves and becoming judges with evil thoughts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
