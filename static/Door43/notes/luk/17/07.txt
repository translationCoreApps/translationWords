\v 7 But which of you, who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come immediately and sit down to eat'?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But which of you ... will say to him ... sit down to eat'?** - Jesus asks his disciples a question to help them think about the role of a servant. This could be a statement. AT: "But any of you ... will not say to him ... sit down to eat'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **a servant plowing or keeping sheep** - "a servant that plows your field or takes care of your sheep"
  * **Will he not say to him ... eat and drink'?** - Jesus uses a second question explain how the disciples would actually treat a servant. This can be a statement. AT: "He will certainly say to him ... eat and drink'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **put a belt around your clothes and serve me** - "tie your clothes at your waist and serve me" or "dress up properly and take care of me." People would tie their clothes closely around their waist so that their clothes would not get in their way while they worked. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Then afterward** - "Then after you serve me"
