===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

  * **he searches for victims** - Here the word "he" refers to the eagle.
  * **victims** - "animals that he can kill and eat"
  * **his eyes see them** - Here "his eyes" refer to the eagle. AT: "he sees them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **His young** - "The baby eagles." It may be helpful to state that this happens after the eagle kills and animal. AT: "After an eagle kills an animal, the baby eagles"
  * **drink up blood** - "drink the blood of the animal that he killed"
  * **where killed people are** - "where there are dead people." This phrase refers to dead bodies that are lying out in the open, not to bodies that are buried in the ground.
  * **there he is** - It can be made explicit that he comes to eat the dead bodies. AT: "he is there to eat them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
