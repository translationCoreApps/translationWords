\v 3 He gave me this task because of the secret truth about which I wrote to you briefly;
\v 4 when you read what I have already written briefly about that, you will be able to understand that I clearly understand the truth about Christ.
\v 5 Formerly, God did not fully reveal the good news that was to come to anyone. It was something that no one understood, but now his Spirit has revealed the good news to his apostles and prophets whom the Spirit called to serve God.

\v 3 I am writing according to the revelation made known to me. This is the hidden truth that I wrote about briefly in another letter.
\v 4 When you read about this, you will be able to understand my insight into this hidden truth about Christ.
\v 5 In other generations this truth was not made known to the sons of men. But now it has been revealed by the Spirit to his consecrated apostles and prophets.
