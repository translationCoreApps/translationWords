\v 8 There were only ten of them whom they spared\f + \ft Or: did not kill \f*. They were not killed because they promised to Ishmael that \add if he allowed them to remain alive, they would bring him\add* lots of wheat and barley and olive oil and honey that they had hidden.
\v 9 The well where Ishmael's men had thrown the corpses of the men whom they had murdered was the deep well that King Asa's men had dug \add in order that they would have water in the city\add* if the army of King Baasha of Israel would surround the city. Ishmael's men filled that well with corpses.

\v 8 But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, "Do not kill us, for there are provisions of ours in a field: wheat and barley, oil and honey." So he did not kill them with their other companions.
\v 9 The cistern where Ishmael threw all the dead bodies that he and Gedaliah had struck down, was the same cistern that King Asa dug when he was being attacked by King Baasha of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it those who were killed.
