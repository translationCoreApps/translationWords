  * **Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting?** - Paul says this to mock the power of death that has been overcome by Christ. AT: "Death has no victory. Death has no sting." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
