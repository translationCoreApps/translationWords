\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to the king and say to him, 'This is what Yahweh, the one we Hebrews worship, says: "Allow my people to go, in order that they may worship me.
\v 2 If you still refuse to let them go,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues talking with Moses about dealing with Pharaoh and bringing the Hebrew people out of Egypt.

  * **if you refuse to let them go, if you still keep them back** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. They will emphasize to Pharaoh what will happen if Pharaoh does this. AT: "if you continue refusing to let them go" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **then Yahweh's hand will be on your cattle** - The word "hand" here represents Yahweh's power to afflict their animals with disease. AT: "then the power of Yahweh will afflict your cattle " (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **on your cattle** - The word "your" here refers to all the people of Egypt who owned cattle. 
  * **Israel's cattle** - Here "Israel" refers to the people of Israel. AT: "the cattle belonging to the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Egypt's cattle** - Here "Egypt" refers to the people of Egypt. AT: "the cattle belonging to the people of Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
