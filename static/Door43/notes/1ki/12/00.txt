====== 1 Kings 12 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

== Civil war ==
This chapter explains how the united kingdom of Israel was split into the two kingdoms: Israel and Judah. This is sometimes called a "civil war."

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Israel splits ==
God's warning to Solomon came true. In spite of his famous wealth, Solomon had over-taxed his own people and forced them to work for free. When the people requested that King Rehoboam reduce taxes and forced labor, he said that he would be harsher than his father. This caused the 10 northern tribes to revolt and appoint Jeroboam as their king. These northern tribes are now called the kingdom of Israel. Only Judah and Benjamin stayed with Rehoboam. They are called Judah. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:appoint]]) 
 
== Jeroboam introduces calf worship ==
Jeroboam made a terrible mistake. He was afraid that if the people continued to go to Jerusalem to worship in the temple, they would want to return to Rehoboam as their king. So he made two shrines with calves made of gold for the people to worship. This eventually caused the destruction of his whole family. The kingdom of Israel continued worshiping the idols until they were taken slaves by the Assyrians. The northern tribes were unable to truly worship Yahweh without going to Jerusalem in the kingdom of Judah.


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor == 
The people used the metaphor of "yoke" for oppressive government:  "Your father made our yoke difficult. Now then, make your father's hard work easier, and lighten the heavy yoke that he put on us." But Rehoboam promised to increase their oppression with three metaphors: "My little finger is thicker than my father's waist. So now, although my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scorpions." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[:en:obe:kt:oppress]] and [[:en:obe:kt:promise]])
