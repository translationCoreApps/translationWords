===== translationNotes: =====


  * **the man from whom it was bought ... the land's owner** - These two phases refer to the same person. Normally the land would be bought from its owner. 
  * **the man from whom it was bought** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the man who sold it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **All the valuations must be set** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The priests must determine the estimated values" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **by the weight of the sanctuary shekel** - There were shekels of different weights. This is the one that people had to use in the sanctuary of the sacred tent. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]])
  * **Twenty gerahs must be the equivalent of one shekel** - The purpose of this sentence is to tell how much the sanctuary shekel weighs. The gerah was the smallest unit of weight that the Israelites used. AT: "One shekel must equal twenty gerahs." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]])
  * **Twenty gerahs must be the equivalent of one shekel** - If it is necessary to use modern weight units, here is a way to do it. AT: "One shekel must weigh ten grams"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]])
