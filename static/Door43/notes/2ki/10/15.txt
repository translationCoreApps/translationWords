\v 15 When Jehu had left there, he met Jonadab son of Rechab coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said to him, "Is your heart with me, as my heart is with yours?" Jonadab answered, "It is." Jehu said, "If it is, give me your hand." So Jonadab gave him his hand, and Jehu took Jonadab up into the chariot with him.
\v 16 Jehu said, "Come with me and see my zeal for Yahweh." So he had Jonadab ride along with him in his chariot.
\v 17 When he came to Samaria, Jehu killed all who remained from Ahab's descendants in Samaria, until he had destroyed Ahab's royal line, just as was told them before by the word of Yahweh, which he had spoken to Elijah.
