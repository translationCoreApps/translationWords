====== Numbers 22 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===
The chapter begins a section on Balaam. The king of Moab wanted the prophet Balaam to come and curse Israel. God told him not to go but he wanted to go; so God told him to say only what God wanted said. Yahweh was able to used Balaam, even though he was not a prophet of Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:curse]])
