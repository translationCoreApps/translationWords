===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh finishes speaking about Oholibah and the Assyrians and starts speaking to Oholibah.

  * **whose private parts were like those of donkeys, and whose reproductive emissions were like those of horses** - Impossibly large, in order to show how wicked was Oholibah's desire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
