  * **From where, then, comes wisdom** - Wisdom is spoken of as if it were in a place and comes to people. Its coming represents people becoming wise. AT: "Then where do people get wisdom" or "Then how can people become wise" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Where is the place of understanding** - Understanding is spoken of as if it were in a place. AT: "Where do people get understanding" or "How to people learn to understand things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
