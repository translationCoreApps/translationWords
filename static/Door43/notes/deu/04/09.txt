\v 9 Only pay attention and carefully guard yourself, so that you do not forget the things that your eyes have seen, so that they do not leave your heart for all the days of your life. Instead, make them known to your children and your children's children. 
\v 10 On the day that you stood before Yahweh your God at Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, 'Assemble me the people, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel.

  * **Only pay attention ... guard yourself ... you do not forget ... your eyes ... your heart ... your life ... make them known to your children and your children's children ... you stood before Yahweh your God** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they are one person, so all instances of "you," "your," and "yourself," as well as the commands "pay attention," "guard," and "make known" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Only pay attention and carefully guard yourself** - "Pay careful attention and be sure to remember these things always" 
  * **you do not forget ... they do not leave your heart** - These phrases means the same thing and emphasize that the people of Israel must remember what they have seen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **your eyes have seen** - Here "eyes" are a synecdoche for the person. AT: "you have seen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Assemble me the people** - "Bring the people together and bring them to me"
