\v 4 Or what about the eighteen people who died when the tower at Siloam outside Jerusalem fell on them? Do you think that this happened to them because they were worse sinners than everyone else in Jerusalem?
\v 5 I assure you, that was not the reason! But instead, you need to realize that God will similarly punish you if you do not turn from your sinful behavior!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Or those** - This is Jesus' second example of people who suffered. AT: "Or consider those" or "Think about those"
  * **eighteen people** - "18 people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Siloam** - This is the name of an area in Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **do you think they were worse sinners ... Jerusalem?** - "does this prove that they were more sinful ... Jerusalem?" Jesus uses this question to challenge the understanding of the people. AT: "do not think that they were more sinful ... Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **they were worse sinners** - The crowd assumed that they died in this terrible way because they were especially sinful. This could be explicitly stated. AT: "they died because they were worse sinners" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **other men** - "other people." The word here is the general term for a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
  * **No, I say** - Here "I say" emphasizes "No." It may be helpful to state Jesus' point clearly. AT: "They certainly did not die because they were more sinful" or "You are wrong to think that their suffering proves that they were more sinful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **perish** - "lose your life" or "die"
