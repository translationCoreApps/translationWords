===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Hold your voice back from weeping and your eyes from tears** - The voice and eyes are spoken of as if they were people whom Rachel needed to keep from moving. AT: "Stop weeping aloud and stop crying tears" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Hold your voice ... your eyes ... your suffering ... your children ... your future ... your descendants** - Yahweh is speaking to the Israelites as if he were speaking to Rachel ([[:en:bible:notes:jer:31:15|31:15]]), so all instances of "your" and the commands are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
