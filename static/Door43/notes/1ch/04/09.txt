\v 9 Jabez was more respected than his brothers. His mother called him Jabez. She said, "Because I bore him in pain."
\v 10 Jabez called out to the God of Israel and said, "If only you would truly bless me, expand my territory, and your hand will be with me. When you do this you will keep me from harm, so that I may be free from pain!" And God granted him his prayer.
