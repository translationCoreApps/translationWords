====== Acts 27 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Sailing ==
In the ancient Near East, people traveled by boat powered by the wind. During different seasons, it was impossible to travel because the seas were too rough or the wind was blowing in the wrong direction.

== Trust ==
This chapter involves the concept of trust. Paul's trust of God was very great. In turn, he told the sailers and soldiers to trust that God would preserve them along with Paul. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])

== Bread ==
The author uses the imagery of bread in this chapter. Bread's significance can be traced back to the daily provision God provided to Israel in the desert for 40 years and the events of Passover. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:passover]])
