\v 13 Suppose he thinks that she has slept with another man, but neither he nor anyone else knows if it is true or not, because no one saw her doing that.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Then suppose that another man sleeps with her. In that case, she is defiled. Even if her husband does not see it or know about it, and even if no one catches her in the act and there is no one to testify against her, 
\v 14 nevertheless, a spirit of jealousy might still inform the husband that his wife is defiled. However, a spirit of jealousy might falsely come on a man when his wife is not defiled.
