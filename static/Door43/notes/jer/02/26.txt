====== Jeremiah 02:26-28 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 \add Yahweh says this:\add*
\q1 "A robber is disgraced when he is caught.
\q2 And all of you, including your kings and priests and prophets, are similarly disgraced.
\q1
\v 27 You say to \add a piece of\add* wood \add that is carved to become a sacred idol\add*, 'You are our father!'
\q2 And you say to a stone \add that you have set up\add*, 'You are our mother!'
\q1 You have rejected [IDI] me,
\q2 but when you experience troubles,
\q1 you cry out to me to rescue you.
\q1
\v 28 Why do you not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* cry out to the gods that you made?
\q1 You have as many gods as you have cities and towns in Judah.
\q2 So why do you not plead with them to rescue you
\q2 when you experience disasters?
\b
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 A robber is disgraced when he is caught.
\q2 And all of you, including your kings and priests and prophets, are similarly disgraced.
\q1
\v 27 You call a piece of wood that is carved to become a sacred idol, your 'father,'
\q2 and you call a stone that you have set up, your 'mother.'
\q1 You have rejected me
\q2 but when you experience troubles,
\q1 you call for me to rescue you!
\q1
\v 28 Why do you not shout to the gods that you made?
\q2 Why do you not plead with them to rescue you
\q2 when you experience disasters?
\q1 For you have as many gods as you have cities and towns in Judah!
\b


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 26 Like the shame of a thief when he is found, so the house of Israel will be ashamedâ€”
\q they, their kings, their princes, and their priests and prophets!
\q
\v 27 These are the ones who say to the tree, 'You are my father,' and to the stone, 'You gave birth to me.'
\q For their back faces me and not their faces. Nevertheless, they say in the time of troubles, 'Arise and save us!'
\q
\v 28 Yet where are the gods that you made for yourselves? Let them arise if they wish to save you in your time of troubles,
\q for your idols equal your cities in number, Judah!
