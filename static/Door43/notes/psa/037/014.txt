===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The wicked** - This refers to the wicked people. AT: "The wicked people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **have drawn out their swords ... have bent their bows** - Both "swords" and "bows" are weapons used to attack people. The fact that they are "drawn" and "bent" means the attacks are ready to begin. AT: "Have prepared their weapons in order to attack" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **to cast down** - This destruction of the needy people is spoken of as if they were clay pots that would break into pieces when thrown down on the ground. AT: "to destroy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the oppressed and needy** - These terms both refer to people who are powerless to defend themselves. AT: "people who are not able to resist them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Their swords will pierce their own hearts** - Swords are examples of weapons and "hearts" represent the people. To "pierce the heart" is an idiom that means "to kill." AT: "Their weapons will be turned against them and they will kill themselves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **their bows will be broken** - Bows are examples of the weapons the wicked use. AT: "The weapons they use against the righteous will be destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
