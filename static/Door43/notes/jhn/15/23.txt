\v 23 Whoever hates me also hates my Father.
\v 24 If I had not done those things among them, those things in which I showed my power, things that no one else has ever done, they would not have been guilty of sin. Yet now that they have seen me, they hate me, and they hate my Father, too.
\v 25 These words were written in their law and have now come true: 'They hated me for no reason.'
