<usfm>
\v 37-39 It will be like what happened when Noah lived. Until the flood came, \add the people\add* did not know that \add anything bad would happen\add* to them. Before the flood waters covered the earth, \add the people\add* were eating and drinking \add as usual\add*. Some men were marrying women and \add some parents\add* were giving their daughters to men to marry them. They were doing all this until the day that Noah \add and his family\add* entered the big boat. And then the flood came and drowned all \add those who were not in the boat\add*. Similarly, \add the unbelieving people will not know\add* when \add I, the one who came from heaven\add*, will return, \add and they will not\add* be \add expecting me\add*.

\v 37 As the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 38 For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered the ark,
\v 39 and they knew nothing until the flood came and took them all away—so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
