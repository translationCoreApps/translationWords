===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Reuben returned to the pit, and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit** - "Reuben returned to the pit, and was surprised to see that Joseph was not there." The word "behold" here shows that Reuben was surprised to find out Joseph was gone. 
  * **He tore his clothes** - This is an act of deep distress and grief. This can be written more clearly. AT: "He was so grieved that he tore his clothes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Where is the boy? And I, where will I go?** - Reuben uses questions for emphasis the problem that Joseph was missing. These can be written as statements. AT: "The boy is gone! I cannot go back home now!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
