===== translationNotes: =====

  * **must not present the bread of your God** - Here "bread" represents food in general. God did not actually eat the sacrifices. Priests would offer the sacrifice on God's altar, and they would eat some of the meat. AT: "must not present an animal as a food offering to your God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **from the hand of a foreigner** - The word "hand" represents the whole person. It is implied that Israelites could not use animals as a sacrifice to God if they bought it from a foreigner, because foreigners castrated their animals making them unacceptable to God. AT: "that a foreigner has given you, because they castrate their animals" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **they will not be accepted for you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will not accept them from you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
