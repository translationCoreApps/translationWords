===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he will bring down those who live proudly** - Yahweh humiliating those who are proud is spoken of as if proud people were up high and he would cause them to come down low. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the fortified city** - This means fortified cities in general not a specific city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **he will lay low ... he will level** - Yahweh causing an army to destroy fortified cities is spoken of as if Yahweh would do it himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **It will be trampled down by the feet of the poor and the treading of the needy** - Both statements mean the same thing. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The poor and oppressed people will trample on the ruins of the city" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
