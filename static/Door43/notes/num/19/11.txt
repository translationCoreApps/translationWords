====== Numbers 19:11-13 ======

<usfm>
\v 11 All those who touch a corpse will be unacceptable to me for seven days.
\v 12 On the third day and on the seventh day \add after touching a corpse\add*, in order to become acceptable to me again, \add they must sprinkle on themselves\add* some of that water for removing the guilt of their sin. If they do not do that on both of those days, they will continue to be unacceptable to me.
\v 13 All those who touch a corpse, and do not perform in the correct way the ritual to become acceptable to me again, defile Yahweh's Sacred Tent. They will no longer belong to the Israelite people. The water to remove the guilt of sin was not sprinkled on them, so they continue to be unacceptable to me.

\v 11 Whoever touches the dead body of any man will be unclean for seven days.
\v 12 Such a person must purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day. Then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself the third day, then he will not be clean on the seventh day.
\v 13 Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died, and does not purify himselfâ€”this person defiles Yahweh's tabernacle. That person must be cut off from Israel because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him. He will remain unclean; his uncleanness will remain on him.

  * **General Information:** - The ideas of "clean" and "purify" represent being acceptable to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **General Information:** - The ideas of "unclean," "defile," "impurity," and "uncleanness" represent not being acceptable to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **the dead body of any man** - "the dead body of any person"
  * **purify himself** - The person would ask someone who is clean to purify him by sprinkling on him some water mixed with the cows ashes. Asking someone to purify him is spoken of as if he were to purify himself. AT: "ask someone to purify him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **if he does not purify himself the third day, then he will not be clean on the seventh day** - This can be stated in a positive form. AT: "he will be clean on the seventh day only if he purifies himself the third day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **That person must be cut off** - Here the phrase "be cut off" means to be disowned and sent away. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:num:09:13|9:13]]. AT: "That person must be sent away" or "you must send that person away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one sprinkled the water for impurity on him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the water for impurity** - "the water that is sprinkled on impure things to make them pure" or "the water for making things pure"
  * **He will remain unclean; his uncleanness will remain on him** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
