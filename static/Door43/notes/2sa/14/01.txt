\p
\v 1 Now Joab son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart desired to see Absalom.
\v 2 So Joab sent word to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought to him. He said to her, "Please pretend you are a mourner and put on mourning clothes. Please do not anoint yourself with oil, but be like a woman who has mourned a long time for the dead.
\v 3 Then go to the king and speak to him about what I will describe." So Joab told her the words she was to say to the king.
