<usfm>
\v 14 So stand against the devil by clothing yourself with God's truth and righteousness, as if they were pieces of armor you put on to do battle.
\v 15 And firmly believe and obey the good news, which gives us peace with God, just as soldiers firmly put on their boots.
\v 16 In addition, keep trusting firmly in the Lord. That will enable you to protect yourselves from anything that Satan, the evil one, may do to harm you spiritually, just as soldiers carry shields to protect themselves against the arrows that have flaming tips that their enemies shoot at them.

<usfm>
\v 14 Therefore stand firm. Do this after you have put on the belt of truth and the breastplate of righteousness.
\v 15 Do this after you have put on your feet the readiness to proclaim the gospel of peace.
\v 16 In all circumstances pick up the shield of faith, by which you will be able to put out all the flaming arrows of the evil one.

  * **Therefore stand firm** - The words "stand firm" are an idiom meaning to "firmly resist." See how you translated "stand firm" in [[:en:bible:notes:eph:06:12|6:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

  * **truth ... righteousness** - We are to know the truth and act in ways that please God.
  * **the breastplate of righteousness** - Possible meanings are 1) the gift of righteousness covers a believer's heart just as a breastplate protects the chest of a soldier or 2) our living as God wants us, gives us a clear conscience that protects our hearts the way a breastplate protects a soldier's chest. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do this after you have put on your feet the readiness to proclaim the gospel of peace** - Just as a soldier wears shoes to give him solid footing, the believer must have solid knowledge of the gospel of peace in order to be ready to proclaim it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **In all circumstances pick up the shield of faith** - The faith God gives a believer is to be used for protection when the devil attacks like a soldier uses a shield to protect from enemy attacks. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
