\v 38 When were you a stranger in our town and we invited you to stay in our houses? When did you need clothes and we gave you some?
\v 39 When were you sick or in prison and we went to visit you? We do not remember doing any of these things for you.

\v 38 When did we see you a stranger and take you in? Or naked and clothe you?
\v 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?'
