\v 13 Gideon said to him, "Oh, my master, if Yahweh is with us, why then has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers told us about, when they said, 'Did not Yahweh bring us up from Egypt?' But now Yahweh has abandoned us and gave us into the hand of Midian."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my master** - Gideon uses the word "master" as a polite way to greet a stranger. He does not realize he is speaking to Yahweh in the form of an angel or a man.
  * **Where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers told us about, when they said, 'Did not Yahweh bring us up from Egypt?'** - Gideon uses a question to challenge the stranger's statement that Yahweh was with him. Also, the direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT:  "We have not seen any wonderful deeds like the ones our fathers told us about when Yahweh brought them up from Egypt." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **gave us into the hand of Midian** - The phrase "gave us into" means Yahweh allowed the Israelites to be defeated. AT: "allowed the Midianites to defeat us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **gave us into the hand** - Here "hand" represents power or control. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **of Midian** - Here "Midian" represents the people of Midian. AT: "of the Midianites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
