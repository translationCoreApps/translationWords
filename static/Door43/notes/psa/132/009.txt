===== translationNotes: =====

  * **May your priests be clothed with integrity** - Integrity is spoken of as if it were clothing.  AT: "May people recognize that your priests have integrity" or "I want people see how your priests always do what is right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For your servant David's sake** - "Because of what happened to your servant David." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:132:001|132:1]].
  * **do not turn away from your anointed king** - Here "turning away" means to reject someone. AT: "do not abandon the king that you anointed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
