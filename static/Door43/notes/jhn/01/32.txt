\v 32 It was John's work to tell us what he saw. He spoke like this, "I saw God's Spirit as he was descending from heaven in the form of a dove. The Spirit came down and remained on Jesus.
\v 33 At first, I myself did not know him, but God sent me to baptize people with water, people who said they wanted to turn from their sinful ways. God told me, 'The man on whom you will see my Spirit descend and remain is the one who will baptize all of you with the Holy Spirit.'
\v 34 I have seen and I bear witness to you that he is the Son of God."

\v 32 John testified, saying, "I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it stayed upon him.
\v 33 I did not recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water said to me, 'Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, he is the one baptizing in the Holy Spirit.'
\v 34 I have both seen and testified that this is the Son of God."
