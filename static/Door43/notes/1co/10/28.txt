====== 1 Corinthians 10:28-30 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 But if someone says to you, "This is food that was sacrificed \add to an idol\add*," do not eat it, for the sake of the person who told that to you, and also because someone may think that it is wrong \add to eat such food\add*.
\v 29 I do not mean that you \add should be concerned about whether it is all right to eat such food\add*. What I mean is that you should be concerned about others who may think that it is wrong to eat such food. Since I know that I am free\f + \ft Or: have the right \f* \add to eat such food without God punishing me\add*, no one should \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* say that what I am doing is wrong just because he himself thinks that it is wrong.
\v 30 If I thank \add God\add* for the food when I eat \add food that has been offered to an idol\add*, no one should criticize me for eating food for which I have thanked God \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!

\v 28 But if someone says to you, "We bought this food at the idol temple and it was sacrificed to the gods," then do not eat the food, for the good of the person who served it, and so as not to cause conflict in the sense of right and wrong.
\v 29 This is being careful about how that other person thinks about right and wrong, not how you think about it. My personal choices are not to be changed by what another person believes is right or wrong.
\v 30 If I enjoy the meal with thanksgiving, I should not permit someone else to condemn me.

\v 28 But if someone says to you, "This food was from a pagan sacrifice," do not eat it. This is for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience.
\f + \ft Some older copies add, \fqa For the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord. \fqb But the best copies do not have this. \f*
\v 29 I do not mean your own conscience, but the other person's conscience. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience?
\v 30 If I partake of the meal with gratitude, why am I being insulted for that for which I gave thanks?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But if someone ... the other person's conscience** - Some translations put these words in parentheses because 1) the form of "you" here is singular, but Paul uses the plural form immediately before and after and 2) the words "For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience?" seem to build on "eat whatever is set before you without asking questions of conscience" ([[:en:bible:notes:1co:10:25|10:27]]) rather than "the other person's conscience." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **says to you ... do not eat ... informed you ... your own conscience** - Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so the words "you" and "your" and the command "do not eat" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **For why ... conscience? If I partake ... gave thanks?** - Possible meanings are 1) the word "for" refers back to [[:en:bible:notes:1co:10:25|10:27]], "I am not to ask questions of conscience, so why ... conscience? If I partake ... gave thanks?" or 2) Paul is quoting what some Corinthians were thinking, "As some of you might be thinking, 'For why ... conscience? If I ... thanks?'"
  * **why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience?** - The speaker wants the hearer to answer the question in his mind. AT: "You should know without me telling you that no one should be able to say I am doing wrong just because that person has ideas about right and wrong that are different from mine. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If I partake of the meal with gratitude, why am I being insulted for that for which I gave thanks?** - The speaker wants the hearer to answer the question in his mind. AT: "I partake of the meal with gratitude, so no one should insult me for that for which I gave thanks." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If I partake** - If Paul is not quoting what some Corinthians might be thinking, the "I" represents those who eat meat with thankfulness. "If a person partakes" or "When a person eats"
  * **with gratitude** - "and thank God for it" or "and thank the person who gave it to me for it"
