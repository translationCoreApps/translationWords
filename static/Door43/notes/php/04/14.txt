\v 14 Nevertheless, you did very well in that you \add helped me\add* \f + \ft Or: \add gave me money\add* \f* \f + \ft euphemism \f* while I have been suffering hardship.

\v 15 \add My friends there at Philippi\add*, you yourselves know that during the time I first \add proclaimed\add* the message about Christ \add to you\add*, when I left there to go to Macedonia \add province\add*, you were the only group of believers \f + \ft litotes \f* who \add sent me\add* gifts \f + \ft euphemism \f* in order that I might \add proclaim that message\add* to others just like I did for you.
\v 16 Even \add when I was\add* in Thessalonica \add city\add*, you sent \add money\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* to me two different times \f + \ft idiom \f* in order to \add supply\add* what I needed.
\v 17 I say this, not because I desire that you give me money now. Instead, I desire that \add God\add* will abundantly bless \f + \ft metaphor \f* you as a result of \add your helping me\add*.

\v 14 Nevertheless, you did the right thing to share with me in my hardship.
\p
\v 15 My friends there at Philippi, you yourselves know that during the time I first proclaimed the good news to you, when I left there to go away from the province of Macedonia, no assembly of believers sent me funds or helped me in any way except you only!
\v 16 Even when I was in the city of Thessalonica, you sent money more than once to supply what I needed.
\v 17 I say this, not because I desire that you give me money now. Instead, I want to see you do even more things that God will praise you for.

\v 14 However, you did well to share with me in my difficulties.
\v 15 You Philippians know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church supported me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone.
\v 16 Even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent help for my needs more than once.
\v 17 It is not that I seek the gift. Instead, I seek the fruit that increases to your credit.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in my difficulties** - Paul speaks of his hardships as if they were a place that he was in. AT: "when things became difficult" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the beginning of the gospel** - Paul refers to the gospel here as meaning his preaching of the gospel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **no church supported me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only** - This can be stated in the positive. AT: "you were the only church that sent me money or helped me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **I seek the fruit that increases to your credit** - Paul is speaking of the Philippians' gift as if it were a person's bank account that increases more and more. In this case, it is God who acknowledges the good things done by the Philippian believers. Paul wants the Philippians to give gifts so they can receive spiritual blessings. AT: "I do want to see God give you more and more spiritual blessings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
