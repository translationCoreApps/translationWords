====== Revelation 10 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Seven thunders ==
It is unclear what this references, but it does seem to reference something . It is perfectly acceptable for the translator to not understand this phrase and translate it as "seven thunders." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_apocalypticwriting]])

== "The mystery of God" ==
It is uncertain what this references. It is not the "mystery" Paul describes, namely the church. It probably does share the meaning of being something that is currently hidden or unknown, which will be revealed at this time. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:reveal]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== "Coming down from heaven" ==
Heaven is frequently said to be "up." The reason for this is to emphasize that heaven is not located on the earth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

== Simile ==
There are many different similes used to describe the mighty angel. The similes are used to try to describe what John sees by relating it to everyday things. The rainbow and cloud are probably not metaphors since the simile is not used. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Scrolls ==
The scroll mentioned in this chapter is different than the scrolls which have been the subject of much of the book of Revelation to this point. It is called to "little scroll" here. The translator should ensure the reader is aware that there is more than one scroll.
