====== John 03 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Light ==
These are common images in the New Testament. Light is used here to indicate the revelation of God and his righteousness. Darkness describes sin and sin seeks to remain hidden from God. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:light]], [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]], [[:en:obe:kt:darkness]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]]) 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "We know that you are a teacher come from God" ==
Although this appears to be display of faith, it is not. This is because believing Jesus is "only a teacher" shows a lack of awareness of who he truly is. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:faith]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== "Son of Man" ==

Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man" in this passage. It may not be possible in every language to have someone speaking about himself in the third person. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sonofman]])
