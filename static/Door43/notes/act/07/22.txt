===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Moses was educated** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The Egyptians educated Moses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **all the learning of the Egyptians** - This is an exaggeration to emphasize that he had a very high level of education. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **mighty in his words and works** - "effective in his speech and actions" or "influential in what he said and did"
  * **it came into his heart** - "he thought about and decided." This is an idiom that means "he decided" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **visit his brothers, the children of Israel** - This refers to his people, and not just to his family. AT: "see how his own people, the children of Israel, were doing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Seeing an Israelite being mistreated ... the Egyptian** - This can be stated in active form by rearranging the order. AT: "Seeing an Egyptian mistreating an Israelite, Moses defended and avenged the Israelite by striking the Egyptian who was oppressing him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **striking the Egyptian** - Moses hit the Egyptian so hard that he died.
  * **he thought** - "he imagined"
  * **by his hand was rescuing them** - "was rescuing them through Moses" or "was using Moses to rescue them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
