===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah explains the parable he just told.

  * **For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel** - "For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts represents the house of Israel" or "The people of Israel are like the vineyard of Yahweh, Lord of the angel armies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the men of Judah his pleasant planting** - "the people of Judah are like the vines the farmer cared for" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing** - This can be reworded so that the abstract nouns "justice" and "killing" are expressed as the verbs "do what is fair" and "killed one another." AT: "Yahweh waited for the people to do what is fair, but instead they killed one another" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **for righteousness** - The phrase "he waited" is left out but it is understood. AT: "He waited for righteousness" or "He waited for them to do what is right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **instead, a cry for help** - "instead, there was a cry for help." The reason people cried out for help can be made explicit. AT: "instead those who were weak cried out to him for because others were attacking them" (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
