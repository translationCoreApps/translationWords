===== translationNotes: =====

  * **King Solomon made** - It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people helped Solomon do this. AT: "King Solomon's men made" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **two hundred large shields** - "200 large shields" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Six hundred shekels of gold** - A shekel is a unit of weight equal to about 11 grams. AT: "About 6.6 kilograms of gold" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]]) 
  * **Six hundred shekels** - Because the word "shekels" does not appear here in the Hebrew text, some modern versions assume instead the unit of bekah, which was equivalent to only a half shekel. Any version making this assumption would signal a metric equivalent of about three kilograms.
  * **He also made** - It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people helped Solomon do this. AT: "The king's men also made" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **three hundred shields** - "300 shields" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Three minas of gold** - A mina is a unit of weight equal to about 600 grams. AT: "About 1.8 kilograms of gold" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]])
  * **the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon** - "the house called the House of the Lebanon Forest." Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:07:01|7:2]].
