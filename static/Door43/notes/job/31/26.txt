<usfm>
\q
\v 26 If I have seen the sun when it shone,
\q or the moon walking in its brightness,
\q
\v 27 and if my heart has been secretly attracted,
\q so that my mouth has kissed my hand in worship of themâ€”
\q
\v 28 this also would be a crime to be punished by judges,
\q for I would have denied the God who is above.
