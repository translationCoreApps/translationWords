\v 8 We should not have sexual relations with someone to whom we are not married, as many of them did. As a result, God \add punished them by\add* causing twenty-three thousand people to die in \add only\add* one day.

\v 7 Do not be idolaters, as some of them were. This is as it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."
\v 8 Let us not commit sexual immorality, as many of them did. In one day, twenty-three thousand people died because of it.

  * **idolaters** - "people who worship idols"
  * **sat down to eat and drink** - "sat down to eat a meal"
  * **play** - Paul is quoting the Jewish scriptures. His readers would have understood from this one word that the people were worshiping an idol by singing and dancing and engaging in sexual activities, not simply enjoying innocent fun. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **In one day, twenty-three thousand people died** - "God killed 23,000 people in one day"
  * **because of it** - "because they committed those unlawful sexual acts"
