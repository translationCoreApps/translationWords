\v 8 And now you are planning to fight against the kingdom that Yahweh established to be governed by [IDI] David's descendants. It is true that you have a huge army, and you and your soldiers have brought with you the golden \add statues of\add* calves that Jeroboam's workers made to be your\f + \ft plural \f* gods.
\v 9 But you expelled the priests that Yahweh \add appointed\add*, men who are descendants of Aaron \add the first Supreme Priest\add*, and you expelled the descendants of Levi, and you appointed the priests that you wanted, like the people of other countries do \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. You allow anyone to become a priest of idols that are not gods if he comes to set himself apart\f + \ft Or: dedicate himself \f* to be a priest by sacrificing a young bull and seven rams.

\v 8 And now you are planning to fight against the kingdom that Yahweh established to be governed by David's descendants. It is true that you have a huge army, and you and your soldiers have brought with you the golden statues of calves that Jeroboam's workers made to be your gods.
\v 9 But you drove out the priests that Yahweh appointed, men who are descendants of Aaron the first high priest. You also drove out the descendants of Levi, and you appointed the priests that you wanted, like the people of other countries do. One comes to consecrate himself to Yahweh by bringing to be a priest a young bull and seven rams to be sacrified, that same priest would be the one who just offered sacrifices to gods that were no gods at all.

\v 8 Now you say that you can resist the ruling might of Yahweh in the hand of the descendants of David. You are a large army, and with you are the golden calves that Jeroboam made as gods for you.
\v 9 Have you not driven out Yahweh's priests, the descendants of Aaron, and the Levites? Have you not made for yourselves priests in the manner of the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams may become a priest of what are no gods.
