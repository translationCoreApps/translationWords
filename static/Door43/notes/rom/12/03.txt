<usfm>
\v 3 Because God has kindly appointed me \add to be his apostle\add*, which I did not deserve, I say this to every one of you: Do not let what you think about yourselves exceed what is right for you to think! Instead, think \add about yourselves\add* in a sensible way that \add corresponds to the abilities\add* that God has given you \add because\add* you trust \add in Christ\add*.

<usfm>
\v 3 Because God has kindly appointed me to be his apostle, which I did not deserve, I say this to every one of you: Do not think you are better than you really are. Instead, think about yourselves in a sensible way, a way that is the same as the way in which God has allowed you to trust in him.

\v 3 For I say, because of the grace that was given to me, that everyone who is among you should not think more highly of themselves than they ought to think. Instead, they should think in a wise way, just as God has given out to each one a certain amount of faith.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **because of the grace that was given to me** - Here "grace" refers to God's choosing Paul to be an apostle and leader of the church. You can make this explicit in your translation. You can also translate this in an active form. AT: "because God freely chose me to be an apostle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **that everyone who is among you should not think more highly of themselves than they ought to think** - "that no one among you should think they are better than other people"
  * **Instead, they should think in a wise way** - "But you should be wise in how you think about yourselves"
  * **just as God has given out to each one a certain amount of faith** - Paul implies here that believers have different abilities that correspond to their faith in God. AT: "since God has given each of you different abilities because of your trust in him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
