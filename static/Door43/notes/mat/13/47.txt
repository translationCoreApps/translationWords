\v 47 What God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] \add will do to people who falsely say that they are letting him\add* rule their lives is like what certain \add fishermen\add* did \add with the fish they caught\add* in a lake, using a large net. They caught all classes \add of fish, both useful and worthless fish\add*.
\v 48 When the net was full, the \add fishermen\add* pulled it up onto the shore. Then they sat there and put the useful \add fish\add* into buckets, and threw the worthless ones away.

\v 47 When God rules from heaven, it is like what certain fishermen did with the fish they caught in a lake with a large net. They caught all kinds of fish, both useful and worthless fish.
\v 48 When the net was full, the fishermen pulled it up onto the shore. Then they sat there and put the good fish into buckets, but they threw the worthless ones away.

\v 47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and that gathered creatures of every kind.
\v 48 When it was filled, the fishermen drew it up on the beach. Then they sat down and gathered the good things into containers, but the worthless things they threw away.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus describes the kingdom of heaven by telling a parable about fishermen who use a large net to catch fish. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **the kingdom of heaven is like a net** - The kingdom is not like the net, but the kingdom draws all kinds of people like a net catches all kinds of fish. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the kingdom of heaven is like** - Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used only in Matthew. If possible, use "heaven" in your translation. AT: "When our God in heaven shows himself to be king, it will be like." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:24|13:24]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **like a net that was cast into the sea** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "like a net that some fishermen cast into the sea" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **was cast into the sea** - "was thrown into the lake"
  * **gathered creatures of every kind** - "caught all kinds of fish"
  * **drew it up on the beach** - "pulled the net up onto the beach" or "pulled the net ashore"
  * **the good things** - "the good ones" 
  * **the worthless things** - "the bad fish" or "the inedible fish"
  * **threw away** - "did not keep"
