\v 3 \add Early\add* in the morning \add you say\add*, 'It will be stormy weather today, because the sky is red, and dark clouds have formed.' You understand how to predict \add the weather by looking at the sky\add*, but you cannot \add seem to look at what is happening\add* now\add and by that\add* understand \add what God is doing\add*.
\v 4 \add You\add* evil people have seen me\add perform miracles\add* but you do not faithfully worship God \f + \ft metaphor \f*. You want to see \add me perform\add* a miracle \add that would prove that God has sent me\add*. But \add God\add* will \add enable you to see\add* only one miracle. It will be \add like\add* what happened \f + \ft metaphor \f* to Jonah, \add the prophet, who was inside a huge fish for three days and then came out of it to live again\add*." Then Jesus left them and sailed away, \add along with us disciples\add*.

\v 3 But if the sky is red in the morning we say, 'It will be stormy weather today.' By looking at the sky, you can tell what the weather will be, but when you see the things that are now happening all around you, you do not understand what God is doing.
\v 4 You evil people have seen me perform miracles, but you do not faithfully worship God. So I will do no miracle for you, except the miracle that happened to Jonah the prophet, who spent three days inside a huge fish but came out again." Then Jesus left them and sailed away, along with his disciples.

\v 3 And in the morning you say, 'It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.
\v 4 An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." Then Jesus left them and went away.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues his response to the Pharisees and Sadducees.

  * **in the morning** - "when the sun is coming up"
  * **foul weather** - "cloudy, stormy weather"
  * **red and overcast** - "red and cloudy"
  * **You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky** - "You know how to look at the sky and understand what kind of weather you will have"
  * **but you cannot interpret the signs of the times** - "but you do not know how to look at what is happening right now and understand what it means"
  * **An evil and adulterous generation** - Here "adulterous" is a metaphor for people who are not faithful to God. AT: "unfaithful generation" or "godless generation." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:12:38|12:39]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **seeks for a sign** - This request angers Jesus because of the religious leaders skeptical attitude about Jesus. He had already performed many miracles, but they still did not believe him. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:12:38|12:39]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **no sign will be given to it** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will not give a sign." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:12:38|12:39]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **except the sign of Jonah** - "except the same sign God gave to Jonah the prophet." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:12:38|12:39]].
