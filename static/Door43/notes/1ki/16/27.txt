===== translationNotes: =====

  * **are they not written in the book of the events of the kings of Israel?** - This question is used to either inform or remind the readers that the information about Omri is in this other book. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:15:31|15:31]]. AT: "they are written in the book of the events of the kings of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **are they not written ... Israel?** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "someone has written about them in the book of the events of the kings of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Omri slept with his ancestors** - The euphemism "sleeping" here represents dying. AT: "Omri died as his ancestors had" or "Like his ancestors, Omri died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **became king in his place** - The phrase "in his place" is a metaphor meaning "instead of him." AT: "became king instead of Omri" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
