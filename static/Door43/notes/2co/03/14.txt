<usfm>
\v 14 But the Israelites stubbornly refused to \add understand that the old agreement would end\add*. Even now, when they read the old agreement, \add they still do not realize that it has ended. It is as if\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* that same veil \add that Moses put on his face\add* is now over their \add minds, keeping them from understanding God's true message\add*. They will \add understand that message\add* only when \add they come to trust\add* in Christ. Then \add it will be as though God\add* has removed the veil.
\v 15 \add Throughout all these years\add*, even until now, when \add the Israelites\add* read what Moses \add write, it is as though\add* a veil is covering their minds.
\v 16 But when any of them believes in the Lord \add Jesus\add*, \add God\add* removes that veil from them.

\v 14 Long ago, the children of Israel refused to believe God's message. Even today, when the old law is read, they wear that same veil. Only when we are joined with Christ does God take the veil away.
\v 15 Yes, even today, whenever they read the law of Moses, it is as if they had a veil over their minds.
\v 16 But when a person turns to the Lord, God removes that veil.

\v 14 But their minds were closed. Even until this very day the same veil remains on the reading of the old covenant. It is not opened up, because only in Christ is it done away with.
\v 15 But even today, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts.
\v 16 But when a person turns to the Lord, the veil is lifted away.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But their minds were closed** - "But their minds were hardened." Paul speaks of the minds of the Israelite people as objects that could be closed or made hard. This expression means that they were unable to understand what they saw. AT: "But the Israelites could not understand what they saw" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Even until this very day ... But even today** - These phrases refer to the time at which Paul was writing to the Corinthians.
  * **the same veil remains on the reading of the old covenant** - Just as the Israelites could not see the glory on Moses' face because he covered his face with a veil, there is a spiritual veil that prevents people from understanding when they read the old covenant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **on the reading of the old covenant** - "when someone reads the old covenant" or "when they hear someone read the old covenant"
  * **It is not opened up, because only in Christ is it done away with** - Here both occurrences of the word "it" refer to "the same veil." This can be stated in active form. AT: "No one removes the veil, because only in Christ does God remove it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **whenever Moses is read** - Here the word "Moses" refers to the Old Testament law. This can be stated in active form. AT: "whenever someone reads the Mosaic law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a veil lies over their hearts** - Here the word "hearts" refers to the mind and thoughts. A spiritual veil covers their hearts, preventing them from being able to understand the old covenant. AT: "a veil lies over their minds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the veil is lifted away** - This means they are now given the ability to understand. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God lifts the veil away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
