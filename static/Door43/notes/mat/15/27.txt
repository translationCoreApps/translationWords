===== translationNotes: =====

  * **even the little dogs eat some of the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables** - The woman responds by using the same imagery as Jesus used in the proverb he just spoke. She means non-Jews should be able to have a small amount of the good things Jews are throwing away. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **little dogs** - Use words here for dogs of any size that people keep as pets. Translate this is you did in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:15:24|15:26]].
  * **let it be done** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **At that hour** - This is an idiom. AT: "at exactly the same time" or "immediately" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **her daughter was healed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Jesus healed her daughter" or "her daughter became well" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
