<usfm>
\v 8 If Joshua had led the Israelites to enter the place of resting, God would not have spoken later about another \add time when we could rest\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add So we know God was speaking about another time when some people would enter that place of resting eternally\add*.
\v 9 So, just like \add God rested on\add* the seventh day \add after he finished making everything\add*, there remains a time when God's people will rest eternally.
\v 10 Specifically, whoever enters God's place of resting has ceased doing things\add to gain God's favor\add*, just like God ceased doing his work \add of creating everything\add*.


\p
\v 11 God severely punished the \add Israelites because they disbelieved his message\add*. So we must strive to experience entering that\add place of\add* resting \add eternally\add*, in order that he will not severely punish any of us for not believing \add his message\add*.

\v 8 If Joshua had led the Israelites to enter the only place of resting God would give them, then much later God would not have spoken again about another day of rest. But he did give them another promise of rest.
\v 9 So, just as God rested on the seventh day after he finished creating everything, there remains a time when God's people will rest eternally.
\v 10 Whoever enters God's place of resting has ceased from his work, just as God finished doing his work of creating everything.


\p
\v 11 So we eagerly enter into the rest of God by following Christ, so that the example of those who disobey will not influence us and ruin us too.

\p
\v 8 For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken about another day.
\v 9 Therefore there is still a Sabbath rest reserved for God's people.
\v 10 For he who enters into God's rest has himself also rested from his deeds, just as God did from his.
\v 11 Therefore let us be eager to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the kind of disobedience that they did.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here the writer warns believers not to disobey but to enter into the rest God offers. He reminds them that God's word will convict them and that they can come in prayer with the confidence that God will help them.

  * **if Joshua had given them rest** - The peace and security provided by God are spoken of as if they were rest that Joshua could give. AT: "if Joshua had brought the Israelites to the place where God would give them rest" or "if the Israelites during the time of Joshua had experienced God's blessings of rest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **there is still a Sabbath rest reserved for God's people** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "there is still a Sabbath rest that God has reserved for his people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Sabbath rest** - Eternal peace and security are spoken of as if they were the Sabbath day, the Jewish day of worship and rest from working. AT: "eternal rest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

AT: "will disobey in the same way as they did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
