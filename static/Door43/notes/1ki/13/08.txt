\v 9 because Yahweh commanded me not to eat or drink anything here. He also commanded me not to return home on the road on which I came here."

\v 8 The man of God said to the king, "Even if you give me half your possessions, I will not go with you, nor will I eat food or drink water in this place,
\v 9 because Yahweh commanded me by his word, 'You will eat no bread nor drink water, nor return by the way that you came.'"
\v 10 So the man of God left another way and did not return to his home by the way that he had come to Bethel.
