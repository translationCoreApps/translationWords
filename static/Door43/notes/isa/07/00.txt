====== Isaiah 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 7:7-9, 18-25, which are important quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Young woman" ==
Some translations choose to translate this as "virgin" and believe it is a reference to the messiah being born of a virgin woman. This is only one possible translation, therefore most translations have avoided forcing this specific connotation into the meaning of the term. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:christ]]) 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Israel ==
In this chapter, Israel is a reference to the northern kingdom of Israel and not the nation as a whole. They are also called Ephraim in this chapter after its most prominent tribe.
