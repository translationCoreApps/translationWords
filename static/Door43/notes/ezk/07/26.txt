\v 26 Disaster upon disaster will come, and there will be rumor after rumor. 
\q Then they will seek a vision from the prophet, but the law will perish from the priest and advice from the elders.
\q
\v 27 The king will mourn and the prince will dress in despair, 
\q while the hands of the people of the land will tremble in fear. According to their own ways I will do this to them! 
\q And I will judge them with their own standards until they know that I am Yahweh.'"
