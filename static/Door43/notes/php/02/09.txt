\v 9 Because of Christ's obedience to him, God honored him very much;
\q he honored him more than anyone else who has ever lived,
\q
\v 10 so that when everyone hears the name "Jesus"
\q everyone will bow down to honor him,
\q people who are in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth;
\q

\q
\v 9 Therefore God also highly exalted him.

\q
\v 11 He did this so that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
\q to the glory of God the Father.
