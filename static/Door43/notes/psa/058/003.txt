\q
\v 3 The wicked go astray even when they were in the womb;
\q they go astray from birth, speaking lies.
\q
\v 4 Their poison is like a snake's poison;
\q they are like a deaf adder that stops up its ears,
\q
\v 5 that pays no attention to the voice of charmers,
\q no matter how skillful they are.
