\v 36 Yahweh said to me, "Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? So present to them their disgusting actions,
\v 37 since they have committed adultery, and since there is blood on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols, and they have even put their sons into the fire, as food for their idols.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah?** - Yahweh uses this rhetorical question as a command for Ezekiel. This question can be written as a statement. The cities of Jerusalem and Samaria are represented by Oholah and Oholibah. AT: "Son of man, you will judge Oholah and Oholibah!" or "Son of man, judge the people of those two cities represented by Oholah and Oholibah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **there is blood on their hands** - This is an idiom. AT: "they have murdered people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
