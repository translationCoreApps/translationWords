===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will give to you** - Here "you" is singular and refers to Peter. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **the keys of the kingdom of heaven** - Here "keys" represent Jesus giving Peter authority. This does not make Peter the owner of the kingdom, but he has authority to decide who will enter God's kingdom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the kingdom of heaven** - This refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used only in the book of Matthew. If possible, use "heaven" in your translation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **keys** - objects used to lock or unlock doors
  * **bind on earth shall be bound in heaven ... loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven** - This metaphor means that God in heaven will approve of what Peter allows or forbids on earth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **shall be bound ... shall be loosed** - These can be stated in active form. AT: "God will bind ... God will loose" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
