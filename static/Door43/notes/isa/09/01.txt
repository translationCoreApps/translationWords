===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The gloom will be dispelled from her who was in anguish** - Isaiah speaks of people who are spiritually lost as if they were walking around in total darkness. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will remove the darkness from her who was in anguish" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **The gloom** - This word means "partial or total darkness." Translate as you translated "gloom" in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:08:21|08:22]].
  * **her who was in anguish** - "her who was suffering great pain and sadness." This is probably a metaphor for the people of Judah (see UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **In an earlier time he humiliated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali** - "Land" refers to the people who live in an area. AT: "In the past, the Lord humbled those living in Zebulun and Naphtali" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **but in the later time he will make it glorious, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations** - Here "it" refers to Galilee which represents the people who live there. AT: "but in the future, the Lord will honor the people of Galilee of the nations, which is on the road between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Galilee of the nations** - Here "nations" represents the people from other nations that live in Galilee. AT: "Galilee, where many foreigners live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **walked in darkness ... lived in the land of the shadow of death** - Isaiah speaks of the people living sinful lives and suffering because of it as if they had been walking in a dark or living in a land of shadow of death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a great light ... light has shone** - Here "light" represents hope and deliverance. (See  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the land of the shadow of death** - The phrase "shadow of death" is an idiom that means absolute darkness. AT: "the land of deepest darkness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
