====== Hosea 07:1-2 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 "and when I wanted to heal them again,
\q2 \add I did not do it\add*
\q1 because I saw the wicked things that \add the people of\add* Samaria \add city\add* and \add other places in\add* Israel \f + \ft doublet \f* have done.
\q1 They constantly deceive others;
\q2 bandits rob people in the streets.
\q1
\v 2 But they do not realize that I do not forget all the evil deeds that they do.
\q2 \add It is as though\add* they are surrounded by all the sins that they commit;
\q2 and \add it is though\add* those sins are always right in front of me \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 As often as I try to heal Israel,
\q2 the people openly show that they are sinning,
\q1 and the people in the city of Samaria show the same thing.
\q2 They lie and cheat in their buying and selling;
\q1 they are like lawless men who attack people who are walking in the streets.
\q1
\v 2 But they do not take a moment to think that I, Yahweh, see everything they do.
\q2 Everywhere they go, they commit evil,
\q1 and I see it all.


\q1

\c 7
\m
\q
\v 1 Whenever I want to heal Israel,
\q the sin of Ephraim is exposed,
\q as well as the evil deeds of Samaria,
\q for they practice deceit;
\q a thief comes in,
\q and a marauding band attacks in the street.
\q
\v 2 They do not realize in their hearts
\q that I remember all their evil deeds.
\q Now their deeds surround them;
\q they are before my face.
