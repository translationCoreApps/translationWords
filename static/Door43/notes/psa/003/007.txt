===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Rise up** - David speaks of starting to do something as getting up. AT: "Take action" or "Do something" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **hit all my enemies ... break the teeth of the wicked** - These phrases say very similar things. The phrases "my enemies" and "the wicked" refer to the same group of people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **For you will hit all my enemies on the jaw** - This was a way of insulting people. David speaks as if Yahweh would come and physically hit his enemies. AT: "For you will insult all my enemies like someone hitting them on the jaw" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you will break the teeth of the wicked** - Animals attack with their teeth. Breaking their teeth takes away their power to attack. David speaks as if Yahweh would come and physically fight against the wicked. AT: "you will make the wicked unable to harm me like someone breaking the teeth of a ferocious animal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Salvation comes from Yahweh** - The abstract noun "salvation" can be expressed with the verb "save." AT: "Yahweh saves his people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
