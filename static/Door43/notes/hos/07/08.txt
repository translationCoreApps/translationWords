===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking.

  * **Ephraim mixes himself among the peoples** - This is probably a reference to the efforts made by the northern kingdom's kings to ally themselves with other nations for protection against attack.
  * **Ephraim is a flat cake that has not been turned over** - This can be stated in active form. Here "Ephraim" refers to the northern kingdom of Israel. The nation is weak, as flat bread that has not been doubled over in the oven by the baker for more strength. AT: "The people of Ephraim are like a cake that no one has turned over" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Gray hairs are sprinkled on him** - Here "gray hairs" represent old age. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **but he does not know it** - However, this "old age" is clearly a way of saying that the northern kingdom is getting weaker and weaker, because the nation does not know it is "old." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
