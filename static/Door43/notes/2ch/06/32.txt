\v 32 There will be some foreigners who do not belong to your Israelite people who have come here from countries far away because they have heard that you are very great and that you \f + \ft metonymy \f* perform great miracles \f + \ft metonymy \f*. It they turn toward this temple and pray,
\v 33 from your home in heaven listen to his prayer, and do for them what they request you to do. Do that in order that all the people-groups in the world will know about you \f + \ft metonymy \f* and revere you, like we, your own Israelite people do. And then they will know that I have caused this temple to be built for you \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

\v 32 There will be some foreigners who do not belong to your Israelite people who have come here from countries far away because they have heard that you are very great and powerful. If they turn toward this temple and pray,
\v 33 then from your home in heaven please listen to their prayer and do for them what they request you to do. Do that in order that all the people groups in the world will honor and obey you, as your people of Israel do. And do this so that they will know that you are present in this temple that I have built.

\p
\v 32 As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel, but who—because of your great name, your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm—comes and prays toward this house,
\v 33 then please listen from heaven, the place where you live, and do all that the foreigner asks of you, so that all the people of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and that they might know that this house I have built is called by your name.
