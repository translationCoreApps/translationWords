===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my bones were wasting away** - Here "my bones" refers to the writer. AT: "I was wasting away" or "I was getting weaker" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **all day long** - This idiom means "continually." AT: "all the time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **day and night** - These extremes include everything in between. AT: "all the time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **your hand was heavy upon me** - Here "hand" refers to Yahweh. The entire phrase is an idiom that means "you afflicted me." AT: "you made me suffer greatly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **My strength withered as in summer drought** - David's strength is compared to a small, green plant that turns brown and crumbles in the dry season. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Selah** - This may be a musical term that tells people how to sing or play their instruments here. Some translations write the Hebrew word, and some translations do not include it. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:003:001|3:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
