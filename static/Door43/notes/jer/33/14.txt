\v 14 'Look! Days are coming—this is Yahweh's declaration—when I will do what I have promised for the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
\v 15 In those days and in that time I will make a righteous branch to grow for David, and he will carry out justice and righteousness in the land.
\v 16 In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will live in security, for this is what she will be called, "Yahweh is our righteousness."'
