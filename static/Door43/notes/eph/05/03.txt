===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Do not suggest any kind of immoral act and do not desire what others have or wrong things others do. Such sins can cause people to say bad things about God's people, who are together set apart for God, not for sin.
\v 4 Do not tell obscene stories to others or say foolish things or joke about committing sins. Such things are not what people who belong to God talk about. Instead, thank God for his love when you talk to others.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 3 But there must not be even a suggestion among you of sexual immorality or any kind of impurity or of greed, for these are improper for God's holy people.
\v 4 Let there be no filthiness, no foolish talk, and no crude jokesâ€”all of which are improper. Instead there should be thanksgiving.
