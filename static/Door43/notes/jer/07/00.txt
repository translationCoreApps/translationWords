====== Jeremiah 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 7:29-34, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Justice in society ==
Jeremiah commanded the people of Jerusalem to live justly. Without justice, they did not truly have faith in Yahweh. Without this faith in Yahweh, the temple and its rituals were useless. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:justice]], [[:en:obe:kt:faith]] and [[:en:obe:kt:temple]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Do not pray for this people" ==
Yahweh wanted the people to repent. This statement, the others that follow, may be taken in another way. They are intended to show that it is too late for the people, and their punishment will come regardless of their response. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:repent]])
