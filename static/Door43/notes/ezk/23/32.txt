===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues his metaphor in which he speaks of the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. This metaphor continues through [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:23:33|23:34]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **You will drink your sister's cup** - Here Yahweh speaks of punishment as if it were a cup of wine the woman drank. AT: "You will drink the same cup of punishment as your sister"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **your sister's cup that is** - Here the "cup" represents what is in the cup. AT: "from your sister's cup that is" or "what is in your sister's cup, her cup is" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a laughingstock ... a subject for derision** - Both of these phrases refer to a person who is laughed at and criticized because of their foolish behavior. A derision is something or someone that is mocked or ridiculed.(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **this cup contains a great amount** - This sentence does not say what is in the cup because it is understood by reading [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:23:30|23:31]]. AT: "this cup contains a great amount of punishment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
