\v 9 The message \add that Moses taught them was wonderful, but when people heard\add* that message, \add they realized that they were sinners and that God\add* would punish them. But God's message that we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* teach is a\add* much more wonderful message. We teach people that God will erase the record of\f + \ft Or: declare people no longer guilty for \f* \add the sinful things that they have done\add*.
\v 10 \add The truth is that, although the work of teaching the people to obey God's laws\add* was once important, it is not as important now, because \add the work of teaching people that God will forgive them and\add* enable them to live to please him is far more important.
\v 11 Furthermore, \add the message that Moses taught was not a lasting message, just like\add* the brightness on his face was not lasting and soon faded away. But \add when God gives his Spirit to people\add*, the wonderful work that \add God's Spirit does in their lives\add* is much greater \add because\add* it lasts forever.

\v 9 Even the law shined with God's brilliant light. But that brilliant light of the law can only bring death to everyone. So how very much more does his brilliant light shine in us when God makes us right with himself!
\v 10 When the brilliant light of the law is compared with God's work of putting us right with himself, it is as if the law is not wonderful at all, because what replaced it is so much more wonderful!
\v 11 So you can see that the law, which is passing away, was wonderful, but you can also see that what is replacing it will be even more wonderful; and it will last forever.

\v 9 For if the service of condemnation had glory, how much more does the service of righteousness abound in glory!
\v 10 For indeed, that which was once made glorious is no longer glorious in this respect, because of the glory that exceeds it.
\v 11 For if that which was passing away had glory, how much more will what is permanent have glory!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the service of condemnation** - "the ministry of condemnation." This refers to the Old Testament law. AT: "the ministry that condemns people because it is based on the law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **how much more does the service of righteousness abound in glory!** - Here the word "how" marks this phrase as an exclamation, not as a question. AT: "then the service of righteousness must abound in so much more glory!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclamations]])
  * **the service of righteousness abound in glory** - Paul speaks of "the service of righteousness" as if it were an object that could produce or multiply another object. He means that "the service of righteousness" is far more glorious than the law, which also had glory. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the service of righteousness** - "the ministry of righteousness." This refers to the new covenant, of which Paul is a minister. AT: "the ministry that makes people righteous because it is based on the Spirit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **that which was once made glorious is no longer glorious ... because of the glory that exceeds it** - The Old Testament law no longer appears glorious when compared with the New Covenant, which is much more glorious.
  * **that which was once made glorious** - This can be stated in active form. AT "the law which God once made glorious" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **in this respect** - "in this way"
  * **that which was passing away** - This refers to "the service of condemnation," which Paul speaks of as if it were an object capable of disappearing. AT: "that which was becoming useless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
