<usfm>
\v 17 Then some of his disciples said to one another, "What is this that he says to us, 'A short amount of time you will no longer see me and after another short amount of time you will see me,' and, 'Because I go to the Father'?"
\v 18 Therefore they said, "What is this that he says, 'A short amount of time'? We do not know what he is talking about."
