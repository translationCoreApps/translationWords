===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the foreigner who is among you in your camp, from him who cuts your wood to him who draws** - There were many foreigners among the Israelites. AT: "the foreigners who are among you in your camp, from those who cut your wood to those who get your water" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
