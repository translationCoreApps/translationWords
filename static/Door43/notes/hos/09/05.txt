===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Hosea the prophet is speaking.

  * **What will you do on the day of an appointed festival, on the day of a festival for Yahweh?** - Hosea uses this question to emphasize that the people will no longer be able to observe their festivals when their enemies defeat them and take them captive. AT: "You will not be able to celebrate the festivals that Yahweh appointed for you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the day of an appointed festival ... the day of a festival for Yahweh** - Both of these mean the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **if they escape** - Here "they" still refers to the people of Israel. You can continue stating this is second person. AT: "if you escape" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Egypt will gather them, and Memphis will bury them** - Egypt and Memphis refer to the people who live there. AT: "the army of Egypt will capture you. You will die there, and the people in the city of Memphis will bury you" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **As for their treasures of silver—sharp briers will possess them** - Briers growing in the places where Israelites stored their silver is spoken of as if the briers were human enemies that would take the Israelite's precious possessions for themselves. AT: "Sharp briers will grow where they store their treasures of silver" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **sharp briers will possess them, and thorns will fill their tents** - Here "sharp briers" and "thorns" mean the same thing. To have briers and thorns growing represents a land that has become desolate and like a wilderness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **their tents** - Here "tents" represents the Israelites' homes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
