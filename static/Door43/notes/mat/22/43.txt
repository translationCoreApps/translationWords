  * **General Information:** - Jesus quotes from the Psalms to show that the Christ is more than just "the son of David."

  * **How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord** - Jesus uses a question to make the religious leaders think deeply about the Psalm he is about to quote. AT: "Then, tell me why David in the Spirit calls him Lord" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **David in the Spirit** - "David, whom the Holy Spirit is inspiring." This means the Holy Spirit is influencing what David says.

  * **The Lord said** - Here "Lord" refers to God the Father.
  * **to my Lord** - Here "Lord" refers to the Christ. Also, "my" refers to David. This means the Christ is superior to David.
