\v 3 An Ammonite or a Moabite may not belong to the assembly of Yahweh; as far as to the tenth generation of his descendants, none of them may belong to the assembly of Yahweh.
\v 4 This is because they did not meet you with bread and with water on the road when you had come out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram Naharaim, to curse you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **may not belong to the assembly of Yahweh** - This is an idiom. AT: "may not be a full member of the Israelite community" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **as far as to the tenth generation of his descendants** - This "tenth"is the ordinal number for ten. AT: "even after ten generations of his descendants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **they did not meet you with bread and with water** - The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "they did not welcome you by bringing you food and drink" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **against you ... curse you** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "you" here is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
