====== Job 24:24-25 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 They prosper for a little while,
\q2 and then \add suddenly\add* they are gone;
\q2 they disappear like weeds wither and die;
\q2 they are like \f + \ft simile \f* stalks of grain that have been cut off.
\q1
\v 25 If this is not true, is there \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* anyone who will show that I am a liar
\q2 and prove that what I have said is not true?"
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 They prosper for a little while,
\q2 and then suddenly they are gone;
\q2 God will make them die like all the other people;
\q2 they will be like stalks of grain that the farmers have cut off.
\q1
\v 25 If this is not true, is there anyone who will show that I am a liar
\q2 and prove me wrong?"
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 24 These people are exalted; still, in only a little while, they will be gone;
\q indeed, they will be brought low; they will be gathered up like all the others;
\q they will be cut off like the tops of ears of grain.
\q
\v 25 If it is not so, who can prove me to be a liar;
\q who can make my speech worth nothing?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This concludes Job's speech.

  * **they will be brought low** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will bring them low" or "God will destroy them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they will be gathered up like all the others** - Some translations are based on a different early text, which says "they wither and fade like weeds." (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_textvariants]])
  * **they will be gathered up like all the others** - This can be stated in active form. What "the others" refers to can be stated clearly. AT: "God will gather them up as he gathered up the other wicked people" See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **they will be cut off like the tops of ears of grain** - These wicked people will be cut off in the same way heads of grain are cut off during harvest. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will cut them off like a farmer cuts off the top of a stalk of grain" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **If it is not so, who can prove me to be a liar; who can make my speech worth nothing?** - Job uses this question to express the certainty of his argument. The implicit answer is: "no one." AT: "This is true, and no one can prove that I am a liar; no one can prove me wrong." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **make my speech worth nothing** - "prove what I say is wrong"
