\v 27 See! I will strike you with my hand and cut off your food. I will hand your life over to your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your obscene behavior.
\v 28 You have acted like a prostitute with the Assyrians because you could not be satisfied. You acted like a prostitute and still were not satisfied.
\v 29 You performed many more acts of prostitution in the land of the merchants of Chaldea, and even this did not satisfy you.
