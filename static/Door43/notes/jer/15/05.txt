===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh has just told them he will assign them to four groups to kill them—the sword, dogs, birds, and beasts.

  * **For who will have compassion for you, Jerusalem? Who will grieve for you? Who will turn to ask about your welfare?** - AT: "No one should have compassion on you, the people who live in Jerusalem. No one should mourn for your destruction. No one should ask why you became such a miserable people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **You have forsaken me ... you have gone back from me** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the people have, indeed, forsaken Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself as if he were another person so that Jeremiah and the people of Judah will listen carefully to what he says. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|01:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what Yahweh has said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **pitchfork** - a farm tool with a long handle and sharp metal prongs, used especially for lifting and tossing grain in the air for winnowing.
  * **I will bereave them** - "I will cause their children to die" or "I will let their enemies kill their children"
