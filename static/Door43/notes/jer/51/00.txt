====== Jeremiah 51 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 51:1-64, which is an extended quotation.

The prophesied destruction of Babylon continues in this chapter. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== Babylon destroyed ==

Babylon will be conquered and the Jews will return to their homeland. At this time, Babylon control almost the entire Near East. The fulfillment of this prophecy would have been unthinkable. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]] )

== Covenant with Abraham ==
Babylon is destroyed because it drove the people of Judah from their homeland. This is in line with the promises of the covenant Yahweh made with Abraham to curse those who curse Abraham's descendants. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:promise]], [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]] and [[:en:obe:kt:curse]])
