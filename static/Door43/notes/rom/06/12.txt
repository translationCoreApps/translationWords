\v 12 So, do not let the \add desire to\add* sin \f + \ft personification \f* control your bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f* with the result that you do the sinful things that you desire to do. \add Remember that\add* your bodies will surely die, \add but your spirits will never die\add*.
\v 13 Do not let any of your body parts do wicked things, as \add you did\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add when you were spiritually\add* dead. Instead, present yourselves to God as people who are alive \add spiritually\add*. Present all your body parts to God, \add to allow him\add* to use them to \add do\add* righteous things.
\v 14 Do not let a \add desire to\add* sin control you \f + \ft personification \f*. The laws \add that God gave Moses\add* did not enable you\add to stop sinning\add*. But \add now\add* God controls you and kindly helps you \add not to sin\add*.

\v 12 So when you want to sin, do not allow yourselves to do what you want. Remember that your body will die one day.
\v 13 Do not use any part of your body to do anything wicked. Instead, present yourselves to God as people who are now alive after belonging to the realm of the dead. Use every part of your body for God. Allow him to use you to do righteous things.
\v 14 When you desire to sin, do not do it! The laws that God gave Moses did not enable you to stop sinning. But now God controls you and kindly helps you not to sin.

\v 12 Therefore do not let sin rule in your mortal body in order that you may obey its lusts.
\v 13 Do not present the parts of your body to sin, to be tools used for unrighteousness. But present yourselves to God, as dead ones who are now living. And present the parts of your body to God as tools to be used for righteousness.
\v 14 Do not allow sin to rule over you. For you are not under law, but under grace.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul reminds us that grace rules over us, not the law; we are not sin's slaves, but God's slaves.

  * **do not let sin rule ... Do not allow sin to rule** - Paul describes sin as a person's king or master. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **your mortal body** - This phrase refers to the physical part of a person, which will die. AT: "you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **in order that you may obey its lusts** - As master, "sin" wants the sinner to obey its commands to do evil things.
  * **Do not present the parts of your body to sin, to be tools used for unrighteousness** - The picture is of the sinner offering the "parts of his body" to his master or king. One's "body parts" are a synecdoche for the whole person. AT: "Do not offer yourselves to sin so that you do what is not right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **But present yourselves to God, as dead ones who are now living** - Here "now living" refers to the believer's new spiritual life. AT: "But offer yourselves to God, because he has given you new spiritual life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **present the parts of your body to God as tools to be used for righteousness** - Here "parts of your body" is a synecdoche that refers to the whole person. AT: "let God use you for what is pleasing to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Do not allow sin to rule over you** - Paul speaks of "sin" here as if it were a king who rules over people. AT: "Do not let sinful desires control what you do" or "Do not allow yourselves to do the sinful things you want to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **For you are not under law** - To be "under law" means to be subject to its limitations and weaknesses. You can make the full meaning explicit in your translation. AT: "For you are no longer bound to the law of Moses, which could not give you the power to stop sinning" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **but under grace** - To be "under grace" means that God's free gift provides the power to keep from sinning. You can make the full meaning explicit in your translation. AT: "but you are bound to God's grace, which does give you the power to stop sinning" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
