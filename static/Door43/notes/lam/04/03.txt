===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the jackals offer the breast to nurse their cubs** - This means that mother jackals freely allow their babies to nurse.
  * **jackals** - fierce wild dogs, the worst of unclean animals
  * **the daughter of my people** - This is a poetic name for Jerusalem, which is spoken of here as if it were a woman. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lam:02:11|2:11]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
