===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will walk in the way of integrity** - Here David speaks about "living" as if it were "walking." AT: "I will live in a way that is honest and right" or "I will live a life full of integrity" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will walk with integrity within my house** - Here David speaks about "living" as if it were walking." Also, David speaks of overseeing his house with integrity, as if integrity were a physical object residing in his house. AT: "I will oversee my house with integrity" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will not put wrongdoing before my eyes** - "Wrongdoing" is an abstract noun that can be written as a phrase. The idiom, "put evil before my eyes," means to approve of it. AT: "I will not approve of anyone doing anything that is wrong in my presence" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **it will not cling to me** - David describes "evil" as if it were something unable to cling to him. This means that he would avoid evil things and people doing evil things. AT: "I will completely avoid evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **cling** - hold on to something or someone very tightly
