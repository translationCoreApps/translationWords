\v 12 So \add it is clear that\add* it is God who will decide \add whether or not he approves of\add* what each of us has done.


\p
\v 13 Since \add it is God who will judge everyone\add*, we must stop saying that \add God should\add* punish some of our fellow believers! Instead, you\f + \ft Or: we \f* should decide that you\f + \ft Or: we \f* will not do anything that would \add be an example that might cause\add* fellow believers to stop trusting in God \f + \ft doublet \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 So we will each have to tell God what we have done and let him decide whether or not he approves of it.


\p
\v 13 Since it is God who will judge everyone, we must stop saying that God should punish some of our fellow believers! Instead, you must be determined to never cause another brother or sister to sin or to stop trusting Christ.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 So then, each one of us will give an account of himself to God.
\p
\v 13 Therefore, let us no longer judge one another, but instead decide this, that no one will place a stumbling block or a snare for his brother.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **will give an account of himself to God** - "will have to explain our actions to God"
  * **but instead decide this, that no one will place a stumbling block or a snare for his brother** - Here "stumbling block" and "snare" mean basically the same thing. AT: "but instead make it your goal not to do or say anything that might cause a fellow believer to sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **brother** - Here this means a fellow Christian, male or female.
