\v 3 So I made a chest. I used wood from an acacia tree to make it. Then I cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I went up the mountain carrying the tablets.
\v 4 There Yahweh wrote on the tablets the \add same\add* ten commandments \add that he had written on the first tablet\add*. They are the commandments that he told to your ancestors from the midst of the fire on the mountain, when they were gathered \add at the bottom of the mountain\add*. Then Yahweh gave the tablets to me,

\v 3 So I made an ark of acacia wood, and I carved two tablets of stone like the first, and I went up the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand.
\v 4 He wrote on the tablets, like the first writing, the Ten Commandments which Yahweh had spoken to you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire on the day of the assembly; then Yahweh gave them to me.
