===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For Zion's sake I will not be silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not be quiet** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. Here "Zion" and "Jerusalem" both represent the people who live in Jerusalem. AT: "For the sake of the people of Jerusalem I will not be silent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will not be silent** - It is most likely that "I" refers to Isaiah.
  * **until her righteousness proceeds brightly, and her salvation as a burning torch** - Both clauses reassure the people that God will eventually come and save the people of Israel and that it will be as apparent as light is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
