====== Mark 13 General Notes ======

=== Structure and format ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 13:24-25, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

There is a large section in this chapter which explains the circumstances surrounding the return of Christ (see: [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:13:05|13:6-37]]). It would have been natural for people to worry about this timing coming because of the judgment associated with it. Jesus assures them that the time of judgment has not yet come. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "I am he" ==
There will be many people who claim to be the return of Christ before he returns. Jesus' return will be undeniable so any other claim to be the returned Christ will be wrong.
