====== Ephesians 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

== "I pray" ==

This chapter is structured loosely as a prayer, but it is not a typical prayer. This is a unique "prayer" where Paul is not just talking to God. He is also giving written instructions to the church in Ephesus. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Predestination ==
Many scholars believe this chapter teaches on a subject known as "predestination." This is related to the biblical concept of "predestine" and some scholars take this to indicate that God has chosen some to be eternally saved before the foundation of the world. Since this is a source of theological diversity, extra care should be taken in translation, especially with regards to elements of causation in this chapter. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:predestine]])
