\v 34 \add Someone in\add* the crowd answered him, "We understand from the Scriptures that the Messiah will live forever.

What kind of man who came from heaven are you\add talking about\add*? \f + \ft Or: That's not the \add kind\add* of Messiah \add we are expecting\add*! \f*"
\v 35 Then Jesus said to them, "\add My message is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a light for you. \add I\add* will be with you for only a little while longer. Live and act \add as you should\add* while I am still with you\add , because suddenly you will have no more opportunity to hear my message! You do not want to be like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add someone\add* who cannot see where he is going anymore\add when it suddenly\add* becomes dark!
\v 36 Believe in my message \f + \ft metaphor \f* while you still have an opportunity to do it, in order that you may become people who have my truth \f + \ft metaphor \f* within you!"


\p After he said those things, Jesus left them and hid from them.

\v 34 Someone in the crowd answered him, "We understand from the scriptures that the Messiah will live forever. So why do you say that the Son of Man will die? Who is this 'Son of Man'?"
\v 35 Jesus answered, "My light will shine on you for just a little longer. Walk in the light while you have my light, or the darkness will overtake you. Those who walk in the darkness cannot see where they are going!
\v 36 Trust in that light while you have the light; then you will belong to the light.
\p After he said those things, Jesus left them and hid from them.

\v 34 The crowd answered him, "We have heard from the law that the Christ will stay forever. How can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?"
\v 35 Jesus then said to them, "The light will still be with you for a short amount of time. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.
\v 36 While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may be sons of light."
\p Jesus said these things and then departed and hid from them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The Son of Man must be lifted up** - The phrase "lifted up" means crucified. You may translate this in a way that includes the implied words "on a cross." AT: "The Son of Man must be lifted up on a cross?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Who is this Son of Man?** - Possible meanings are 1) "What is the identity of this Son of Man? or 2) "What kind of Son of Man are you talking about?"
  * **The light will still be with you for a short amount of time. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going** - Here "light" is a metaphor for Jesus' teachings which reveal the truth of God. To "walk in darkness" is a metaphor that means to live without God's truth. AT: "My words are like a light to you, to help you understand how to live as God wants you to. I will not be with you much longer. You need to follow my instructions while I am still with you. If you reject my words, it will be like walking in darkness and you cannot see where you are going" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may be sons of light** - The "light" is a metaphor for the teachings of Jesus which reveal the truth of God. "sons of light" is a metaphor for those who accept the message of Jesus and live according to God's truth. AT: "While I am with you, accept my words so that God's truth will be in you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
