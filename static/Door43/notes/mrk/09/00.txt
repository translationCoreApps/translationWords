====== Mark 09 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Transfiguration ==

The glory of God is seen as a great, brilliant light in scripture. God's grandeur always produces fear in the person who sees it. Such an event is presented in this chapter. It is called the "transfiguration" because Jesus is changed or transfigured and he shows some of his divine glory. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fear]] and [[:en:obe:kt:glory]]). 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== "It would be better" ==

This phrase introduces teachings, which are intended to be taken as hyperbole. Otherwise, the church would be full of people without any hands. It is best to ensure your readers know these instructions are general principles not to be taken "literally." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:09:42|9:42-48]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Elijah and Moses ==
Elijah and Moses suddenly appear and disappear to Jesus, James, John and Peter. The translator may ask: is this a vision or did they actually appear to these men in physical form? It is best to translate this passage as if they appeared physically because thy were talking with Jesus.

== "Son of Man" ==
Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man" in this passage. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== Paradox ==

This is a statement that seems absurd or appears to contradict itself. For example, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all." (See: [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:09:33|9:35]])
