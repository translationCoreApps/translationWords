===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The Ephraimites ... day of battle** - This is possibly a metaphor for not keeping the covenant (verse 10), but it is best to translate literally.
  * **The Ephraimites** - "The Ephraimite soldiers"
  * **were armed with bows** - The soldiers probably also had arrows. AT: "had bows and arrows for weapons" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
