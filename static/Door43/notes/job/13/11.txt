  * **Would not his majesty make you afraid? Would not his dread fall upon you?** - Job speaks of God's Position and His behavior are to be deeply respected. "I am absolutely certain that his majesty would make you afraid and that his dread would fall on you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **proverbs made of ashes ... defenses made of clay** - Job compares their useless proverbs to ashes and their resistance to the truth to clay. Both statements mean the same for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
