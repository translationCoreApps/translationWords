  * **General Information:** - The angel clothed in linen continues speaking to Daniel.

  * **Many will be purified, cleansed, and refined** - Yahweh does the purifying. These three terms mean basically the same thing. AT: "Yahweh will purify, cleanse, and refine many people"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **refined** - purified by removing anything that does not belong in them
  * **but the wicked will act wickedly** - The evil people will do evil or sinful things.
  * **None of the wicked will understand** - The evil people can not understand spiritual knowledge.
  * **but those who are wise will understand** - "but those who obey Yahweh are wise and will understand"
  * **the regular burnt offering is ... is set up** - The king of the north is the one who stops the temple sacrifices. AT: "the king of the North takes away the regular burnt offering and sets up the abomination that causes complete desolation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the abomination that causes complete desolation** - This refers to an idol that will make the temple desolate, that is, that will cause God to leave his temple. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:11:31|11:31]]. AT: "the disgusting idol that will cause God to abandon the temple" or "the disgusting thing that will make the temple unclean" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **1,290 days** - Here "days" refers to a period of time. Most commonly rendered as days, but can also imply years. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
