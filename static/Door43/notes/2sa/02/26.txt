===== translationNotes: =====

  * **called** - "shouted" or "yelled"
  * **Must the sword devour forever?** - This rhetorical question emphasizes that the battle had already continued too long. Here "sword" refers to the fighting. The killing in the battle is spoken of as if a wild animal was eating the soldiers. AT: "We do not need to keep using our swords to fight and kill each other." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do you not know it will be bitter in the end?** - This rhetorical question is used to force Joab to acknowledge that continued fighting could only result in more suffering. Here "bitter" is a euphemism for the terrible suffering that would occur. AT: "You know very well that there will be a terrible result if this continues!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]]) 
  * **How long will it be before you tell your men to stop pursuing their brothers?** - This rhetorical question is intended to convince Joab to stop fighting their fellow Israelites.  Here "brother" is used to represent the members of the nation of Israel. AT: "Stop this now so that Israelites will not have to kill each other!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **Just as God lives** - This is a very strong vow. AT: "With God as my witness" or "God will affirm that I mean what I say"
  * **if you had not said that ... pursued their brothers until the morning** - This hypothetical statement tells what might have happened if Abner had not spoken wisely to Joab. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
