\v 9 Because Abraham trusted God, he lived as though he were a foreigner in a land that God had promised to give his descendants. Abraham lived in tents, and his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob did also. God promised to give to Isaac and Jacob the same things that he promised to give Abraham.

\v 8 It was by faith that Abraham, when he was called, obeyed and went out to the place that he was to receive as an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he was going.
\v 9 It was by faith that he lived in the land of promise as a foreigner. He lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise.
\v 10 For he was looking forward to the city which has foundations, the city of which the architect and builder would be God.

  * **that he was to receive as an inheritance** - The land that God promised to give Abraham's descendants is spoken of as if it were an inheritance that Abraham was to receive. AT: "that God would give him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
