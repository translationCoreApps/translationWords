===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I hate, I despise your festivals** - The word "despise" is a strong word for "hate." Together the two words emphasize the intensity of Yahweh's hatred for their religious festivals. AT: "I hate your festivals very much." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
