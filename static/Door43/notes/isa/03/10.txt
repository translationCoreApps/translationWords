===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues speaking.

  * **Tell the righteous person that it will be well with him** - "Tell him who is doing what is right that I will make things good for him"
  * **for he will eat the fruit of his deeds** - "for he will receive his reward for his good deeds" or "for he will receive his reward for the good things he has done"
  * **for what his hands have dealt out he will receive** - "for what the wicked person has done to others will be done to him"
  * **My people ... My people** - Possible meanings are 1) Isaiah is talking or 2) Yahweh is talking.
  * **children are their oppressors** - Possible meanings are 1) "young people have become their leaders and they oppress the people" or 2) "their leaders are immature like children and oppress the people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **women rule over them** - Possible meanings are 1) "women rule over the people" or 2) "their leaders are weak like women."
  * **your leaders lead you astray and confuse the direction of your path** - This compares Judah's leaders to shepherds. As shepherds lead the sheep along good paths to safety, leaders should teach the people the truth and help them do what is right. Judah's leaders were not doing this. AT: "your leaders are like bad shepherds who lead you away from good paths and do not show you where to go" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
