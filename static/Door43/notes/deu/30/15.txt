  * **I have placed before you** - Putting something where another person can see it is a metaphor for telling someone about something. AT: "I have told you about" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **life and good, death and evil** - You can make clear the implicit information. AT: "what is good and will cause you to live, and what is evil and will cause you to die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **and multiply** - "and have many descendants"
