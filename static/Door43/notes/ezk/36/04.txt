\v 4-6 Therefore, you mountains of Israel, listen to this message from me.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4-6 Therefore, you mountains of Israel, listen to this message from me. I, Yahweh the Lord, have something to say to you, the hills and mountains, and to you, the ravines and valleys, and to you, the towns and cities which the enemy burned down, where no one is living any longer, from where the enemy has taken everything valuable, and whose people the people groups all around are mocking. "This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare: I am very angry with the people of Edom and the other people groups; they have insulted your Israelite people and happily taken all their land as pastures. So Ezekiel must speak for me to you, the land of Israel, mountains and hills, valleys and ravines: I, Yahweh the Lord, am very angry because the enemy has insulted you.

<usfm>
\v 4 Therefore, mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord Yahweh: The Lord Yahweh says this to the mountains and the high hills, to the streambeds and valleys, to the uninhabited desolations and the forsaken cities that have become plunder and a subject of mocking for the other nations that surround themâ€”
\v 5 therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: I have certainly spoken in the fire of my fury against the other nations, against Edom and all who took my land for themselves as a possession, against all those who had both joy in their heart and disdain in their spirit, as they seized my land that they might claim its pasturelands for themselves.'
\v 6 Therefore, prophesy to the land of Israel and say to the mountains and to the high hills, to the streambeds and to the valleys, 'the Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! In my fury and in my anger I am declaring this because you have borne the insults of nations.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues the message that Yahweh tells Ezekiel to speak to the mountains of Israel. The message is for all of the people of Israel.
  * **General Information:** - It may be helpful to use a verse bridge here, as the UDB does, to arrange the text in a more logical order. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])

  * **listen to the word of the Lord Yahweh** - "listen to the message of the Lord Yahweh"
  * **the uninhabited desolations** - The abstract noun "desolations" can be stated as "desolate cities." AT: "the desolate cities which have no people living in them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the forsaken cities** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the cities that people have left behind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **that have become plunder** - "that enemies have stolen from"
  * **a subject of mocking for the other nations that surround them** - "that the other, surrounding nations mock"
  * **in the fire of my fury** - This speaks of Yahweh's fury as if it were a fire. Yahweh loves Israel very much, so he becomes jealous and angry when other nations mock it. AT: "because of my intense jealousy" or "because of my very strong anger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **against Edom and all** - "and against all of Edom"
  * **had both joy in their heart and disdain in their spirit, as they seized my land** - Here "heart" and "spirit" represent a person's inner being. The UDB reverses the order of these phrases. AT: "insulted my people and joyfully took my land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Behold!** - The word "Behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: "Indeed!"
  * **In my fury and in my anger** - The words "fury" and "anger" mean basically the same thing. Together they emphasize the intensity of his anger. AT: "Because I am extremely angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **you have borne the insults of nations** - "other nations have insulted you" or "other nations have mocked you"
