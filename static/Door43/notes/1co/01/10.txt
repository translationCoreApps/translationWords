====== 1 Corinthians 01:10-11 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 My fellow believers, by the authority of \f + \ft metonymy \f* our Lord Jesus Christ, I urgently appeal to all of you to agree with one another. What I mean is, stop dividing into groups. Instead, be united \f + \ft metaphor \f* concerning what you understand \add about spiritual matters\add* and be united in what you decide.
\v 11 My fellow believers, \add I urge this\add* because some members of Chloe's household have told me that you are quarreling among yourselves.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 My brothers and sisters, I beg you by the authority of Jesus, that you come to an agreement and that you settle your disagreements, and that you no longer divide yourselves into groups. Learn to see things from the same point of view and to work together to accomplish the same task.
\v 11 Those in Chloe's house have reported to me that there are divisions and disagreements among some of you.

\p
\v 10 Now I urge you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree, and that there be no divisions among you. I urge that you be joined together with the same mind and by the same purpose.
\v 11 For it has been made clear to me, my brothers, by Chloe's people that there are factions among you.
