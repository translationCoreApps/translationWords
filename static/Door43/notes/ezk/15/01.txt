\v 1 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 2 "Son of man, how is a vine better than any tree with branches that is among the trees in a forest?
\v 3 Do people take wood from a vine to make anything? Or do they make a peg from it to hang anything on it?
\v 4 See! If it is thrown into a fire as fuel, and if the fire has burned both of its ends and also the middle, is it good for anything?
