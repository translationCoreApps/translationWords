===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You must prepare** - This is spoken to Ezekiel and so the word "You" is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **it will come about that** - This phrase is used here to mark an important part of the instructions. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **your burnt offerings ... your peace offerings ... accept you** - The words "yours" and "you" are second person plural and refer to the people of Israel in general. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **will accept you** - "will gladly receive you"
