  * **The waters you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages** - Here "are" stands for "represents." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The waters** - If you need to, you can use a more specific word for the kind of water. AT: "The rivers." See how you translated "many waters" in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:17:01|17:1]].
  * **multitudes** - "large groups of people" or "great numbers of people"
  * **languages** - This refers to people who speak the languages. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:10:10|10:11]] (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
