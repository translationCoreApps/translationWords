\v 25 But think about this: There were many widows in Israel during the time when \add the prophet\add* Elijah \add lived. During that time\add*, because of there being no rain \f + \ft metonymy \f* for three years and six months, there was a great famine throughout the country.
\v 26 But \add God\add* did not send Elijah to \add help\add* any of those \add Jewish\add* widows. \add God sent him\add* to Zarepath \add town\add* near Sidon \add city\add*, to \add help\add* a \add non-Jewish\add* widow.
\v 27 There were also many \add Jewish\add* lepers in Israel during the time when the prophet Elisha \add lived\add*. But \add Elisha\add* did not heal any of them. He healed only Naaman, a \add non-Jewish\add* man from Syria."

\v 25 But think about this: There were many widows in Israel during the time when the prophet Elijah lived, when there was a great famine throughout the country because there had been no rain for three and half years.
\v 26 But God did not send Elijah to help any of those Israelite widows. God sent him to the town of Zarephath near the city of Sidon, to help a widow.
\v 27 There were also many Israelite lepers in Israel during the time when the prophet Elisha lived. But Elisha did not heal any of them. He healed only Naaman, a man from Syria."

\v 25 But in truth I tell you that there were many widows in Israel during the time of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, and a great famine came upon all the land. 
\v 26 But Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath in Sidon, to a widow living there. 
\v 27 And there were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, but none of them were healed except Naaman the Syrian."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus reminds the people, who are listening to him in the synagogue, about Elijah and Elisha who were prophets about whom they knew. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

  * **But in truth I tell you** - "I tell you truthfully." This phrase was used to emphasize the importance, truth, and accuracy of the statement that follows.
  * **widows** - A widow is a woman whose husband has died.
  * **during the time of Elijah** - The people to whom Jesus was speaking would have known that Elijah was one of God's prophets. If your readers would not know that, you can make this implicit information explicit as in the UDB. AT: "when Elijah was prophesying in Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **when the sky was shut up** - This is a metaphor. The sky is pictured as a ceiling that was closed, and so no rain would fall from it. AT: "when no rain fell down from the sky" or "when there was no rain at all" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a great famine** - "a serious lack of food." A famine is a long period of time when the crops do not produce enough food for the people.
  * **to Zarephath ... to a widow living there** - The people living in the town of Zarephath were Gentiles, not Jews. The people listening to Jesus would have understood that the people of Zarephath were Gentiles. AT: "a Gentile widow living in Zarephath" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Naaman the Syrian** - A Syrian is a person from the country of Syria. The people of Syria were Gentiles, not Jews. AT: "the Gentile Naaman from Syria" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
