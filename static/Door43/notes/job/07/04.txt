===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 4 When I lie down, I say to myself,
\q 'When will I get up and when will the night be gone?'
\q I am full of tossing to and fro until the day's dawning.
\q
\v 5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust;
\q the sores in my skin harden up and then dissolve and run afresh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **When will I get up and when will the night be gone?** - Job poses this question to emphasize his intense suffering during the hours he should be sleeping. AT: "I wish I could get up, but night continues." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **I am full of tossing to and fro** - This indicates that Job has moved in his bed all night without any rest. "I so tired of tossing and turning restlessly."
  * **clods of dust** - lumps of dirt
