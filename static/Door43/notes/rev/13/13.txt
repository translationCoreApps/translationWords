\v 13 The second beast also did awesome miracles, even causing fire from the sky to fall to earth while people watched.
\v 14 He did these miracles on behalf of the first beast. By doing that, he deceived the people on the earth so that they thought they should worship the first beast. But this happened only because God allowed it to happen. The second beast told the people living on earth to make an idol to represent the first beast, the one that was alive, even though someone had killed him with a sword.

<usfm>
\v 13 It performed mighty miracles. It even made fire come down on the earth from heaven in front of people.
\v 14 By the signs it was permitted to do, it deceived those who lived on the earth. It told them to make an image in honor of the beast that had the sword wound but lived.
