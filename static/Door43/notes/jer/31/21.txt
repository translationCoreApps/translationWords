\v 21 Place road signs for yourself. Set up guideposts for yourself. Set your mind on the right path,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - God continues to speak from verse 7.

  * **Place road signs for yourself ... Set up guideposts for yourself ... Set your mind ... you should take ... Come back** - These commands and instances of "yourself" and "your" and "you" are addressed to "virgin Israel" and so are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **Come back, virgin Israel!** - God is referring to a changed Israel. (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **How long will you waver, faithless daughter?** - Yahweh is telling his people that he is becoming impatient with them because they are not obeying him. AT: "Do not hesitate to start obeying me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **waver** - Possible meanings are 1) be unable to decide what to do or 2) often go off the correct path, a metaphor for disobeying Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **new on earth—a woman surrounds a strong man** - Possible meanings are 1) the people will be so safe that women will not need anyone to protect them (see UDB) or 2) this is an idiom for something no one would ever expect AT: "new on earth—as strange as a woman protecting a man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
