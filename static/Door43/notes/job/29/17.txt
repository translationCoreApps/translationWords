<usfm>
\q
\v 17 I broke the jaws of the unrighteous man;
\q I plucked the victim out from between his teeth.
\q
\v 18 Then I said, 'I will die in my nest;
\q I will multiply my days like the grains of sand.
\q
\v 19 My roots are spread out to the waters,
\q and dew lies all night on my branches.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verses 18-20 Job tells about the things he used to say before bad things happened to him.

  * **I broke the jaws of ... I plucked the victim** - Job speaks of unrighteous people who persecute others as if they were wild animals that attack their victims by picking them up between their teeth. AT: "I made unrighteous people stop persecuting people, like someone who breaks the jaw of a wild animal and rescues its victim from between its teeth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will die in my nest** - Here "nest" represents Job's home and family. Job used to speak as if he were a bird that lived in a nest with his baby birds. AT: "I will die at home with my family" (UDB) or "I will die in the safety of my home" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will multiply my days like the grains of sand** - Job used to speak as if the days of his life would be as many as the grains of sand on the shore. This is an exaggeration to express that he would live a very long time. AT: "I will live a very long time" or "I will live many years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **My roots ... my branches** - Job used to speak speak of his strength as if he were strong like a well-watered tree. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
