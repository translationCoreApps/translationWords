  * **Laban gave his female servant Zilpah ... her servant** - Here the author gives background information about Laban giving Zilpah to Leah. Most likely he gave Zilpah to Leah before the wedding. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **Zilpah** - This is the name of Leah's female servant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **behold, it was Leah** - "Jacob was surprised to see it was Leah in bed with him." The word "behold" here shows that Jacob was surprised by what he saw. 
  * **What is this you have done to me?** - Jacob uses a question to express his anger and surprise. AT: "I cannot believe you did this to me!" This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Did I not serve you for Rachel?** - Jacob uses these questions to express his hurt that Laban had tricked him. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "I served you for seven years to marry Rachel!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
