\v 8 Instead, they must be ones who welcome and take care of guests. They must be devoted to\f + \ft Or: like to do \f* what is good. They must do \add what God considers\add* to be right. They must be holy\f + \ft Or: completely dedicated to God \f*. They must be men who do what their minds tell them is right to do \add and not what their emotions, Or: desires urge them to do\add*.
\v 9 They must firmly believe in the message \add about Jesus Christ\add* exactly as \add I\f + \ft Or: we \f*\f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* taught it, in order that they might be able to teach \add the believers\add* what is correct and to urge \add them to follow it well. If they firmly accept our message\add*, they will be able to convince those who oppose \add what is correct that they are wrong\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Rather than that, he must welcome strangers and love the things that are good. He must always control himself and be honest, always tell the truth, and treat other people in a fair manner. He must always think about God when he thinks or does anything, and he must avoid sinning.
\v 9 He must always believe the true things we have taught him, and he must live according to them. He must do this in order to persuade people to live like this too, and in order to correct people if they do not want to live like this.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Instead, he should be hospitable, a friend of what is good. He must be sensible, righteous, godly, and self-controlled.
\v 9 He should hold tightly to the trustworthy message that was taught, so that he may be able to encourage others with good teaching and correct those who oppose him.

  * **a friend of what is good** - To embrace good things and good behavior.
  * **hold tightly to** - Paul speaks of devotion to the Christian faith as if it were grasping the faith with one's hands. AT: "be devoted to" or "know well"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
