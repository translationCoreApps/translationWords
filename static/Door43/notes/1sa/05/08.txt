\v 8 They summoned the five kings of the Philistia people-group, and asked them, "What should we do with the sacred chest of the god of the Israelites?"
\p The kings replied, "Take the sacred chest to Gath \add city\add*." So they moved it to Gath.
\v 9 But after they took it to Gath, Yahweh powerfully struck the people of that city also, with the result that many men, including young men and old men, got tumors on their skins. Then the people became very afraid.

\v 8 So they sent for and gathered together all of the rulers of the Philistines; they said to them, "What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?" They answered, "Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath." So they carried the ark of the God of Israel there.
\v 9 But after they brought it around, Yahweh's hand was against the city, causing a very great confusion. He afflicted the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors broke out on them.
