\v 9 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, "All that belonged to Saul and his family I have given to your master's grandson.
\v 10 You, your sons, and your servants must till the land for him and you must harvest the crops so that your master's grandson will have food to eat. For Mephibosheth, your master's grandson, must always eat at my table." Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **must always eat at my table** - Here "my table" represents being together with David or in his presence. Eating with the king at his table was a great honor. AT: "must always eat with me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Now Ziba ... servants** - Here "now" makes a break in the main storyline. The narrator gives background information about Ziba. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **fifteen sons and twenty servants** - "15 sons and 20 servants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
