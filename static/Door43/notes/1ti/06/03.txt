<usfm>
\v 3 If anyone teaches false doctrines that do not agree with the reliable and true teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ,
\v 4 that person is very proud and does not understand anything. They want to argue about unimportant matters and about certain words, and people who listen to them envy others. They quarrel with others and with one another. They say bad things about others. They suspect that others have evil motives.
\v 5 Their whole way of thinking has become completely wrong because they have rejected true things. As a result, they make the mistake of thinking that by doing religious things they will get a lot of money.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 3 Suppose that someone teaches differently and does not accept our faithful instruction, that is, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ. Suppose that they do not accept the teaching that leads to godliness.
\v 4 That person is proud and knows nothing. Instead, he is sick with controversies and arguments about words. These words result in envy, strife, insults, evil suspicions, and
\v 5 the constant conflict between people with depraved minds. They turn away from truth. They think that godliness is a way to become rich.
\f + \ft Some old copies add, \fqa Withdraw from such things, \fqb but the best ancient copies do not. \f*
