  * **Woe to him who says to a father, ... 'What are you giving birth to?'** - Yahweh speaks of those who would argue him as if they were unborn children who argue with their own parents. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **What are you fathering? ... What are you giving birth to?** - The unborn child asks these rhetorical questions to scold his parents for giving birth to him. These can be translated as statements. AT: "You should not be my father ... You should give birth to me." or "You are not fathering me correctly ... You are not giving birth to me correctly."
