====== Isaiah 36 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The previous chapters have been constructed as prophecy and contain many poetic elements. This chapter switches to a narrative and is a discussion between the officials from Assyria and Judah. To make the meaning clear here, it may be helpful to set apart the extended quotations through the use of indentation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

The people of Judah were to trust in Yahweh because only he could provide them with protection. The people of Jerusalem were protected because they trusted in Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
The Assyrian commanders use rhetorical questions in this chapter to mock or insult Judah and their God, Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
