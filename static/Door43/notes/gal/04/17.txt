====== Galatians 04:17-18 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Those \add who are insisting on obeying Jewish rules\add* are eagerly \add showing interest in\add* you, but \add what they are doing is\add* not good. They even want you not to associate with \add me and other true\add* believers, because they want you to eagerly show \add interest in\add* them, \add not in us\add*.
\v 18 But \add just like\add* it always feels good to have others show that they appreciate you, \add I would like you\add* always \add to appreciate me\add*, and not only when I am with you.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Those who are insisting on obeying the Jewish laws are trying to get you to follow them, but they are not doing it for your good. They want to keep you away from me, because they want you to follow them, not me.
\v 18 Well, it is good to insist on doing the right things; you should do this always, and not only when I am with you. But make sure it is the right people who are teaching you what to do!
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 They passionately seek you, but for no good. They want to separate you from me so you will follow them.
\v 18 It is always good to be passionate for good reasons, and not only when I am present with you.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **passionately seek you ... follow them ... be passionate for good reasons** - The translator should try to capture Paul's use of the same verb in all three phrases. "follow after you ... follow after them ... follow after good things for good reasons"
  * **separate** - Here this means in loyalty, not physical distance.
  * **follow them** - "do what they tell you to do"
