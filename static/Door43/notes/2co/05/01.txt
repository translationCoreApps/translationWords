<usfm>
\v 1 We know that these bodies are only temporary dwelling places, like tents that do not last very long. But we know that when we die, God gives us a permanent place in which we will live, a body that lasts forever, a body that God has made.
\v 2 While we live in our physical bodies, we groan with longing for the bodies we will have when we will live with Godâ€”
\v 3 because when God clothes us in our new bodies, that will be our covering, like clothing.

\p
\v 1 We know that if the earthly dwelling that we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God. It is a house not made by human hands, but an eternal house, in heaven.
\v 2 For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling.
\v 3 We long for this because by putting it on we will not be found to be naked.

  * **if the earthly dwelling that we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God** - Paul speaks of his physical body as if it were a temporary "earthly dwelling" and of the resurrection body that God will give as if it were a permanent "building" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **if the earthly dwelling that we live in is destroyed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "if people destroy the earthly dwelling that we live in" or "if people kill our bodies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **It is a house not made by human hands** - This refers to the "building from God." This can be stated in active form. AT: "It is a house that humans have not made" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
