\v 20 And you even took your sons and daughters who were supposed to be committed to me and sacrificed and killed them as though they were less important than your becoming a prostitute.
\v 21 You slaughtered those who were like my children, and offered them to be sacrifices to these false gods!
\v 22 All during the time when you were acting like a prostitute and doing other detestable things, you did not think about the time when it was as though you were very young, naked, lying in your own blood and kicking in the field.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 Then you took your sons and daughters whom you bore for me, and you sacrificed them to the images to be devoured as food. Are your acts of prostitution a small matter?
\v 21 You slaughtered my children and put them into the fire.
\v 22 In all your abominations and your acts of prostitution you have not thought about the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare as you thrashed about in your blood.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem as if the city were his unfaithful wife. The city represents the people who live there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **whom you bore for me** - "who were my children"
  * **you sacrificed them to the images to be devoured as food ... put them into the fire** - Here Yahweh does not use a metaphor, but speaks of something that the people of Israel had actually done. They sacrificed their children to pagan idols.
  * **you sacrificed them to the images to be devoured as food** - In these ancient pagan sacrifices, the people believed that the gods would eat the food that they offered to them. This can be stated in active form. AT: "you sacrificed them to the images so that the images could devour them as food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Are your acts of prostitution a small matter? You slaughtered** - Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that the woman is acting as if her prostitution was not bad enough and so decided to sacrifice her children, as well. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "You must think that your acts of prostitution are a small matter, and so you slaughtered" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **put them into the fire** - It is implicit that she put them into the fire in order to offer them as burnt offerings to her images. AT: "sacrificed them as burnt offerings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **naked and bare** - These two words mean the same thing. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:16:06|16:7]]. AT: "completely naked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
