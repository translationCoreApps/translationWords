  * **The rushing waters of worthlessness** - This is a picture of fast-flowing flood waters that destroy everything in their path.
  * **The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death trapped me** - David speaks about death and Sheol as if they are people who are trying to trap him as a hunter traps an animal.
