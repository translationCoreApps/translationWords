\v 12 Then the group of soldiers, along with their captain and some of the temple guards, seized Jesus and tied him to prevent him from escaping.
\v 13 Then they took him to Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.
\v 14 It was Caiaphas who had advised other leaders that it would be better that one man should die for the people than that all the people should perish.

\v 12 So the group of soldiers and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and tied him up.
\v 13 They led him first to Annas, for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
\v 14 Now Caiaphas was the one who had given the advice to the Jews that it was better that one man dies for the people.
