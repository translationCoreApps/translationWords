=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Outward ornaments" ==
These were signs of a beautiful woman in ancient Israel. They are contrasted with "inner" beauty or godly character. Many cultures have different standards of external beauty for women. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:godly]])

== Unity ==
The apostles placed a great value on unity in the local church. This chapter encourages unity and peace in the church.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Synecdoche ==
In the referenced verses, the psalmist uses several synecdoches to describe God. This is because God is indescribable and often requires images and other figures of speech for us to understand him. It is also common in poetry to use different figures of speech. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Wives, submit to your husbands ==

Scholars are divided over how to understand this passage in light of its historical and cultural context. Some scholars believe men and women are perfectly equal in all things (known as egalitarianism). Other scholars believe men and women were created to serve in distinctly different roles in marriage and the church (known as complementarianism). How one understands this issue will likely affect how this passage is translated.
