  * **about the sixth hour** - "about noon." This reflects the custom at the time of counting hours beginning with daybreak at 6 a.m.
  * **darkness came over the whole land** - "the entire land became dark"
  * **until the ninth hour** - "until 3 p.m." This reflects the custom at the time of counting hours beginning with daybreak at 6 a.m.
  * **as the sun's light failed** - This does not refer to sundown. Rather, the light of the sun darkened during the middle of the day. Use a term to describe the sun becoming dark rather than the sun going down.
  * **the curtain of the temple** - "the curtain inside the temple." This was the curtain that separated the most holy place from the rest of the temple.
  * **the curtain of the temple was split down the middle** - "the curtain of the temple was torn from top to bottom into two pieces." This can be stated in active form. AT: "God tore the temple curtain into two pieces from the top to the bottom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
