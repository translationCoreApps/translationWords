====== Luke 17:1-2 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 \add One day Jesus\add* said to his disciples, "Things that will tempt \add people\add* to sin are certain to happen, but it will be terrible for anyone who causes them to happen!
\v 2 Suppose you caused one of these people who \add do not believe in me very strongly\add* to sin. If a huge stone was fastened \f + \ft Or:someone fastened a huge stone \f* around your neck and you were thrown \f + \ft Or:and threw you \f* into the sea, \add you would consider that a severe punishment, but God will punish\add* you even more severely \add if you cause someone to sin!\add*

\v 1 Jesus said to his disciples, "Things that tempt people to sin will certainly happen, but how terrible it will be for anyone who causes those things to happen!
\v 2 It would be better for that person if someone fastened a huge stone around his neck and threw him into the sea, than if he were to cause to sin someone who is weak in his faith.

\v 1 Jesus said to his disciples, "It is certain there will be things that can cause us to sin, but woe to that person through whom they come!
\v 2 It would be better for him if a millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues teaching, but he directs his attention back to his disciples. This is still the same part of the story and the same day that began in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:15:03|15:3]].

  * **to that person through whom they come** - "to anyone who causes the temptations to come" or "to any person who causes people to be tempted"
  * **It would be better for him if** - This introduces a hypothetical situation. It means that this person's punishment for causing people to sin will be worse than if they had drowned in the sea. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
