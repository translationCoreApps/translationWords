===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The Jews continue to speak to the man who had been blind.

  * **Why do you want to hear it again?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to express the man's amazement that the Jewish leaders have asked him to tell them again what happened. AT: "I am surprised that you want to hear again what happened to me!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **You do not want to become his disciples too, do you?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to add irony to the man's statement. He knows that the Jewish leaders do not want to follow Jesus. Here he ridicules them. AT: "It sounds like you also want to become his disciples!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]]).
