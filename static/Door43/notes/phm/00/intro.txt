====== Introduction to Philemon ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of Philemon ===

  - Paul greets Philemon (1:1-3)
  - Paul makes requests of Philemon about Onesimus (1:4-21)
  - Conclusion (1:22-25)

=== What is the Book of Philemon about? ===

Paul wrote this letter to a man named Philemon. Philemon was a Christian who lived in the city of Colossae. He owned a slave named Onesimus. Onesimus had run away from his owner and in some way was able to visit Paul in prison. 

In this letter, Paul writes to Philemon. He tells him that he is sending Onesimus back to him, and says that Philemon should welcome him back as a brother in Christ. By Roman law, Philemon had the right to put Onesimus to death. But Paul argues that Philemon should accept Onesimus back as a Christian brother and even suggests that Onesimus should be allowed to come back to Paul and help him in prison.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Philemon." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "Paul's Letter to Philemon," or "The Letter Paul wrote to Philemon." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Does this letter approve of the practice of slavery? ===

While Paul instructs Onesimus to return to his former master, this does not mean that he regarded slavery as an acceptable practice. Instead, Paul lessons focuses on the importance of serving God no matter the circumstances in which one finds themselves.

=== What does Paul mean by the expression "in Christ," "in the Lord," etc.? ===

Paul means to express the idea of very close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

== Singular and plural "you" ==
In this book, the word "I" refers to Paul. Also, the word "you" is almost always singular and refers to Philemon. The two exceptions to this are 3:22 and 3:25. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
