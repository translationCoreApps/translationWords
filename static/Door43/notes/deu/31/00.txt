====== Deuteronomy 31 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Final instructions ==
In the Ancient Near East, it was common for an important leader to give instructions for his people to follow after his death. In this chapter, Moses begins his final words to the people of Israel. These are words that he wants them to remember long after he is gone. This section also helped to make a smooth transition to Joshua's leadership.
