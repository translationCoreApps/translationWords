\v 15-16 Some people proclaim \add the message about Christ as I do\add* because they are happy \add with my work\add*. They proclaim \add the message about\add* Christ because they love \add me and because\add* they know that \add God\add* has placed me \add here\add* in order that I defend the message about Christ \f + \ft chiasmus \f*.
\v 17 Others proclaim \add the message about\add* Christ because they envy \add me\add* and oppose \add me\add*. Those people want to exalt themselves \add above me. They proclaim the message about Christ because they have\add* wrong motives. They \add wrongly\add* assume \add that because they are causing many people to follow them, I will be jealous, and as a result\add*, I will feel more miserable while I am a prisoner \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add here\add*.

\v 15 Some people are proclaiming the good news because they are jealous and they want believers to honor them rather than me. But others are proclaiming the good news because they love Christ and they want people who have not heard the good news to hear it.
\v 16 Those who proclaim the good news because they love Christ know that God appointed me to speak in public and explain why the good news is true.
\v 17 But those who are proclaiming the good news about Christ for selfish reasons do not have good reasons for doing so. They believe they are causing me more suffering while I am here in prison.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Some indeed even proclaim Christ out of envy and strife, and also others out of good will.
\v 16 The ones who proclaim Christ out of love know that I have been put here for the defense of the gospel.
\v 17 But the others proclaim Christ out of selfish and insincere motives. They think they are making trouble for me in my chains.
