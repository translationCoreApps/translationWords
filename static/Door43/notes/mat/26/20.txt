===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he sat down to eat** - Use the word for the position people in your culture usually are in when they eat.
  * **Truly I say to you** - "I tell you the truth." This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **Surely not I, Lord?** - "I am surely not the one, am I, Lord?" Possible meanings are 1) this is a rhetorical question since the apostles were sure they would not betray Jesus. AT: "Lord, I would never betray you!" or 2) this was a sincere question since Jesus' statement probably troubled and confused them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
