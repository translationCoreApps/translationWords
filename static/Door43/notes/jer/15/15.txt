\q
\v 15 You yourself know, Yahweh! Call me to mind and help me. Bring vengeance for me against my pursuers.
\q In your patience do not take me away. Acknowledge that I have suffered reproach for you.
\q
\v 16 Your words have been found, and I consumed them. Your words were a joy to me,
\q a joy to my heart, for your name is proclaimed on me, Yahweh God of hosts.
