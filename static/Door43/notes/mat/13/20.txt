<usfm>
\v 20 \add Some people are like the\add* shallow soil on top of rock. When they hear God's message, they immediately accept it joyfully.
\v 21 \add But because it does not penetrate deeply into their hearts, they believe it for only\add* a \add short\add* time\add . They are like the plants that\add* did not have\add deep\add* roots. When they are treated badly and caused to suffer because they believe \add God's message\add*, they soon stop believing \add it\add*.

\v 20 Some people hear God's message and immediately accept it joyfully. They are like the rocky places where some seeds fell.
\v 21 But because it does not penetrate deeply into their hearts, they believe it for only a short time. They are like the plants that did not have deep roots. When others treat them badly and make them suffer because they believe in what I have told them, they sin by refusing to believe in it any longer.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 What was sown on rocky ground is the person who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,
\v 21 yet he has no root in himself and he endures for a while. When tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, he quickly falls away.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to explain to his disciples the parable about a person who sows seeds.

 is the person who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, 

  * **What was sown on rocky ground** - If a literal translation makes no sense, try to translate so the reader understands that Jesus is the sower, the message is the seed, and the hearer is the rocky ground. AT: "This is how it is with the seed that the sower scattered on the rocky ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **yet he has no root in himself but endures for a while.** - "Yet he has shallow roots and only lasts for a little while." This is a metaphor that means the person was excited at first about the message, but he was not completely devoted to it. AT: "But like a plant that sprouts quickly but does not grow deep roots, he only endures for a little while" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **because of the word** - Here "word" refers to a message. AT: "because of the message" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he quickly falls away** - Here "falls away" means to stop believing. AT: "immediately he falls away" or "he proves his faith was not a true faith" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
