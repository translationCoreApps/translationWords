====== James 02 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Favoritism ==
It is improper to show favoritism in the church. There were people who showed special favor or favoritism towards the rich and powerful. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:favor]])

== Justification ==
Since justification means to "declare righteous." There are two types of justification. One is to be declared to be righteous in the opinion of God and one is to be declared to be righteous in the opinion of other people. Abraham was declared to be righteous, according to God, by his faith. He was declared to be righteous, according to other people, when he showed his faith by being willing to offer up son Isaac as a sacrifice. A person is not justified, according to God, by their actions. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:justify]], [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== "Go in peace, be warmed and eat well" ==
It is possible this phrase is reflexive. James would be telling the people in need to warm themselves and feed themselves.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Quotation marks ==
There is some controversy regarding where to place the quotation marks in James 2:18. The ULB states "Yet someone will say, 'You have faith, and I have works.' Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works." It is also possible, to translate as "Yet someone will say, 'You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works.'" The length of this hypothetical statement can have significant theological implications. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
