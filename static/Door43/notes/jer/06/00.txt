====== Jeremiah 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 6:1-30, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Gods and battle ==
In the ancient Near East, it was commonly believed that a nation's gods were responsible for military victory. It may have been believed that a god would not defend an evil city. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]] and [[:en:obe:kt:evil]])
