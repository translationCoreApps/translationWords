====== Isaiah 52 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

The prophecies of this chapter occur after the exile in Babylon and are not in reference to the people contemporary to Isaiah. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

There is an important teaching or prophecy about the messiah beginning in this chapter and continues through the next chapter. This prophesy begins in 52:13 and scholars usually note that it portrays the messiah as a "suffering servant." (See: [[:en:obe:kt:christ]])
