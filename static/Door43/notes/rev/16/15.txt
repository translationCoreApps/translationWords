===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Verse 15 is a break from the main storyline of John's vision. These are words spoken by Jesus. The storyline continues in verse 16. 

  * **Look! I am coming** - It can be stated clearly that the Lord Jesus was saying this as in the UDB. The parentheses are used here to show that this is not part of the storyline in the vision. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I am coming as a thief** - Jesus will come at a time when people do not expect him, just as a thief comes when not expected. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:03:03|3:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **keeping his garments on** - Living the right way is spoken of as keeping one's clothes on. AT: "doing what is right like people keeping their clothes on"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **keeping his garments on** - Some versions translate, "keeping his garments with him."
  * **they see his shameful condition** - Here the word "they" refers to other people.
  * **They brought them together** - "The spirits of the demons brought the kings and their armies together"
  * **the place that is called** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the place that people call" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Armageddon** - This is the name of a place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
