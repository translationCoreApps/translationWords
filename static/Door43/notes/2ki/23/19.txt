===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Josiah removed ... He did ... He slaughtered ... he burned** - It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people, perhaps Hilkiah and "the priests under him" ([[:en:bible:notes:2ki:23:04|23:4]]), might have helped Josiah do these things. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **what had been done** - "what he had done"
  * **he burned human bones on them** - "he burned human bones on them so no one would use them again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
