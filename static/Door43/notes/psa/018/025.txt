===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer speaks to Yahweh.

  * **To anyone who is faithful** - Here "faithful" means to do what God commands one to do. You can clearly state this in the translation. AT: "to those who faithfully do your covenant" (UDB) or "to those who faithfully obey your commandments" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **to a man who is blameless ... you show yourself pure** - Both of these clauses have similar meanings. The writer repeats these ideas for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **you are clever toward anyone who is twisted** - "you outwit anyone who is not honest"
