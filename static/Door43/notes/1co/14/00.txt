====== 1 Corinthians 14 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 14:21, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

Paul returns to his discussion on the  gifts of the Holy Spirit.


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Tongues ==

The gift of tongues is described as an inferior gift because it primarily serves an individual or a few people within the church; it does not serve the church as a whole. It is also very important that this gift be used in the proper way. The use of tongues is also described as a sign for unbelievers. The exact meaning of this phrase is debated among scholars. 


== Prophecy ==

Prophecy is described as a superior gift because it can be used in service of the entire church, unlike the gifts that are primarily helpful to an individual. Prophecy is described as a gift for believers, but the exact meaning of this phrase is debated among scholars. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])
