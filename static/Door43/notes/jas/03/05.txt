\v 5 Similarly, \add although\add* our tongues are very small, \add if we do not control them\add*, we can \add harm\add* many people by what we proudly say \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Think \add also\add* about how \add just\add* a small \add flame of\add* fire can cause a large forest \f + \ft Or: a large area of brushwood \f* to burn.

\v 6 \add Just like a fire damages a forest\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, when we say things that are evil, \add we harm many people\add*. What we say \f + \ft metonymy \f* reveals that there is much evil within us. What we say contaminates\f + \ft Or: defiles \f* all that we think and do \f + \ft personification, metaphor \f*. \add Just like a flame of fire easily\add* causes \add the whole surrounding area\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* to burn, what we say \f + \ft metonymy \f* can cause \add others\add* to want to do evil. It is the devil himself \f + \ft metonymy \f* who causes us to speak what is evil.

\v 5 In the same way, although our tongues are very small, if we do not control them, we can harm people by talking big. Think also about how just a small flame of fire can cause a large forest to burn.
\p
\v 6 Just like a fire burns a forest, when we say things that are evil, we can destroy many people. What we say reveals that there is much evil within us. What we say contaminates all that we think and do. Just like a flame of fire easily causes the whole surrounding area to burn, what we say can cause sons and daughters and their descendants to want to do evil for the rest of their lives. It is the devil himself who influences us to speak what is evil.

\v 5 Likewise the tongue is a small body part, yet it boasts great things. Notice also how small a fire sets on fire a large forest.
\v 6 The tongue is also a fire, a world of sinfulness set among our body parts. It stains the whole body and sets on fire the course of life. It is itself set on fire by hell.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Likewise** - This word signals the analogy of the tongue to the horses' bits and the ships' rudders mentioned in the previous verses. AT: "In the same way"
  * **boasts great things** - Here "things" is a general word for everything about which these people are proud.
  * **Notice also** - "Think about"
  * **how small a fire sets on fire a large forest** - James draws an analogy between the spark and the tongue. AT: "how a small flame can start a fire that burns many trees" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **tongue is also a fire** - The tongue is spoken of metaphorically as if it were fire. At the same time, the tongue is used as a metonym for a person's ability to speak. AT: "tongue is like a fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a world of sinfulness set among our body parts** - The enormous effects of sinful speaking are spoken of as if they were a world by themselves. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **It stains the whole body** - Sinful speaking is spoken of metaphorically as if it stained one's body. And becoming unacceptable to God is spoken of as if it were dirt on the body.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and sets on fire the course of life** - The phrase "course of life" refers to a person's entire life. AT: ", and it can ruin a person's entire life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **life. It is itself set on fire by hell** - The word "itself" refers to the tongue. Also, here "hell" refers to the powers of evil or to the devil. This can be stated in active form. AT: "life because the devil uses it for evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
