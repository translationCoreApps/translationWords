\v 10 God gives seed to the one who sows, and he gives bread to one who bakes it. He will also supply your seed and increase what you are able to give away to others.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He who supplies** - "God who supplies"
  * **He who supplies seed to the sower ... the harvest of your righteousness** - Paul speaks of the Corinthians' resources as if they are seeds. Just as God provides seeds to the farmer and causes his crop to grow so that people can make bread, he will also provide for the needs of the Corinthians, both to give to others and to provide for themselves. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **bread for food** - Here the word "bread" refers to food in general. AT: "food to eat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He will increase the harvest of your righteousness** - Paul compares the benefits that the Corinthians will receive from their generosity to that of a harvest. AT: "God will bless you even more for your righteousness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the harvest of your righteousness** - "the harvest that comes from your righteous actions." Here the word "righteousness" refers to the righteous actions of the Corinthians in giving their resources to the believers in Jerusalem.
  * **You will be enriched** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will enrich you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **This will bring about thanksgiving to God through us** - Paul speaks as if it were the gifts not the people receiving the gifts as thanking God. AT: "and when we give your gifts to those who need them, they will give thanks to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
