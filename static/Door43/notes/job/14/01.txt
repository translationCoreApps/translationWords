===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This chapter continues Job's speech, which started in [[:en:bible:notes:job:12:01|12:1]]. Job is speaking to God.

  * **Man, who is born of woman** - This refers to all people, both men and women; all are born into this world. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
  * **lives only a few days** - This is an exaggeration to emphasize that people live only a short time. AT: "lives only a very short time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **is full of trouble** - Being "full of trouble" represents experiencing much trouble. AT: "has many troubles" or "suffers much" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He sprouts from the ground like a flower and is cut down** - Like the life of a flower, a person's life is short and is easily killed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **he flees like a shadow and does not last** - A person's short life is compared to a shadow that disappears quickly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Do you look at any of these?** - Job implies that he does not want God to pay so much attention to him. AT: "You do not look at any of these" or "You do not pay so much attention to these. Please do not pay so much attention to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **look at** - Here looking at some one represents paying attention to him in order to judge him. AT: "pay attention to" or "look for faults in" 
  * **Do you bring me into judgment with you?** - Job uses this question to show his surprise that God judges him even though Job is so insignificant like the flowers. AT: "But you judge me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
