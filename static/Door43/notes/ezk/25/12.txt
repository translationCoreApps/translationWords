  * **Edom has taken** - Here "Edom" refers to the people who live there. AT: "The people of Edom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the house of Judah** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the descendants of Judah over many years. Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Judah people group" or "the people of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will strike Edom with my hand** - Here Yahweh speaks of punishing the people as if he were literally hitting them with his hand. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:25:06|25:7]]. AT: "I will punish Edom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will make them ... from Teman to Dedan** - "I will make all of Edom ... from Teman to Dedan." These are two cities at opposite ends of Edom. This means that Yahweh will destroy all of Edom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
