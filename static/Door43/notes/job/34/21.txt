===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For God's eyes are upon a person's ways** - God's "eyes" represent his sight. The phrase "a person's ways" is an idiom for what he does and how he lives. AT: "For God watches everything a person does" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **he sees all his steps** - This means that he always knows where the person is and where he is going. AT: "he sees him wherever he goes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **no darkness, no thick gloom** - The words "thick gloom" mean basically the same thing as, and intensify the word "darkness." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **in judgment** - "so he may judge him" or "to be judged"
