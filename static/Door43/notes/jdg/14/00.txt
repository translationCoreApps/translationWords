====== Judges 14 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The account of Samson continues in this chapter.

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 14:14, 18, which are important quotations.

== Special concepts in this chapter ==

== Intermarriage ==
It was considered sinful for an Israel to marry a Canaanite or anyone from a different people group. This is why Samson's parents did not want him to marry a Philistine woman. They use rhetorical questions to convince him that he is sinning. This woman caused Samson many problems. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
