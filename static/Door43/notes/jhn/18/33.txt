\v 34 Jesus replied, "Are you asking because you yourself want to know, or did others tell you to ask me this question?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I am not a Jew, am I?** - This remark appears in the form of a question so Pilate can emphasize his complete lack of interest in the cultural affairs of the Jewish people. AT: "Well I am certainly not a Jew, and I have no interest in these matters!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **Your own people** - "Your fellow Jews"
