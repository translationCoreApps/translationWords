\v 7 As a result, while you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to return, within your group you truly possess \f + \ft litotes \f* every ability that \add God's\add* Spirit gives \add to believers\add*.
\v 8 God will also cause you to steadfastly \add trust Christ to the very end of your lives\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*. The result will be that God will not consider you guilty \add of any sin\add* when our Lord Jesus Christ returns to earth \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 9 You can depend on God to do that. He is the one who chose you to become intimately associated with his Son, Jesus Christ, who is our Lord.

\v 7 That is the reason you do not lack any gift from the Spirit of God while you wait for the day when God will make the Lord Jesus Christ known and will show him to everyone.
\v 8 God will also make you strong so you can serve him to the very end, so you will bring no shame upon yourselves on the day that our Lord Jesus Christ returns to earth.
\v 9 God is keeping his promise to do that. God called you, so you can know and love his Son, Jesus Christ, who is our Lord.
