\v 14 The armies of heaven were following him. They were riding on white horses. They were wearing clothes made of clean white linen.
\v 15 A sharp sword extends from his mouth; with it he will strike the rebellious people groups. He himself will rule them powerfully as though he had an iron rod. He will crush his enemies as a person crushes grapes in a winepress. He will do this for God, who rules over everything and who is furiously angry with them because of their sins.
\v 16 On his cloak over his thigh a name had been written: "King who rules over all other kings and Lord who rules over all other lords."

\v 14 The armies of heaven were following him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and clean.
\v 15 Out of his mouth goes a sharp sword with which he strikes down the nations, and he will rule them with an iron rod. He tramples in the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.
\v 16 He has a name written on his robe and on his thigh: "King of kings and Lord of lords."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Out of his mouth goes a sharp sword** - The sword blade was sticking out of his mouth. The sword itself was not in motion. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:01:14|1:16]].
  * **strikes down the nations** - "destroys the nations" or "brings the nations under his control"
  * **rule them with an iron rod** - John speaks of the rider's power as if he were ruling with an iron rod. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:12:05|12:5]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He tramples in the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty** - John speaks of the rider's destroying his enemies as if they were grapes that a person tramples in a winepress. Here "wrath" refers to God's punishment of evil persons. AT: "He will crush his enemies according to the judgment of God Almighty, just as a person crushes grapes in a winepress" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])  
  * **He has a name written on his robe and on his thigh:** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Someone has written a name on his robe and thigh:" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
