===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It is because we have no bread** - In this statement, it may be helpful to state that "it" refers to what Jesus had said. AT: "He must have said that because we have no bread" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **no bread** - The disciples had only one loaf of bread, which was not much different than having no bread at all. AT: "very little bread" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Why are you reasoning about not having bread?** - Here Jesus is mildly rebuking his disciples because they should have understood what he had been talking about. This can be written as a statement. AT: "You should not be thinking that I am talking about actual bread." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do you not yet perceive? Do you not understand?** - These questions have the same meaning and are used together to emphasize that they do not understand. This can be written as one question or as a statement. AT: "Do you not yet understand?" or "You should perceive and understand by now the things I say and do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Have your hearts become so dull?** - This metaphor refers to them not being open or willing to understand what Jesus meant. This can also be written as a statement. AT: "How are your hearts not open to understanding what I say?" or "Your hearts are not willing to understand." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
