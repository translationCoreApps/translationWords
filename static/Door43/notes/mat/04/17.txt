===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near** - The phrase "kingdom of heaven" refers to God ruling as king. This phrase is only in the book of Matthew. If possible, use the word "heaven" in your translation. AT: "our God in heaven will soon show himself to be king." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:03:01|3:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
