===== translationNotes: =====

  * **So the young son left and came toward his father** - "So he left that country and started going back to his father." The word "so" marks an event that happened because of something else that happened first. In this case, the young man was in need and had decided to go home.
  * **While he was still far away** - "While he was still far away from his home" or "While he was still far away from his father's house"
  * **was moved with compassion** - "had pity on him" or "loved him deeply from his heart"
  * **hugged and kissed** - The father did this to show his son that he loved him and was glad that the son was coming home. If people think that it is strange or wrong for a man to hug and kiss his son, you can substitute a way that men in your culture show affection to their sons. AT: "welcomed him affectionately"
  * **sinned against heaven** - Jewish people sometimes avoided saying the word "God" and used the word "heaven" instead. AT: "I have sinned against God." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:15:17|15:18]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in your sight** - This idiom means "in your presence" or "against you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I am not worthy to be called your son** - "I am not worthy to be called your son." This can be stated in active form. AT: "I am not worthy for you to call me son." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:15:17|15:18]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
