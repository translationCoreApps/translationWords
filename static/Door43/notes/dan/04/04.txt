<usfm>
\v 4 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living in my palace. I was living luxuriantly, and everything was going very well for me.
\v 5 But one night I had a dream that caused me to be very afraid. I saw visions that terrified me as I lay on my bed.
\v 6 So I summoned all the wise men in Babylon, in order that they would come and tell me what it meant.

\v 4 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living happily in my house, and I was enjoying prosperity in my palace.
\v 5 But a dream I had made me afraid. As I lay there, the images I saw and the visions in my mind troubled me.
\v 6 So I gave a decree to bring before me all the men of Babylon who had wisdom so they could interpret the dream for me.
