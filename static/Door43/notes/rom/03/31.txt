Instead, we truly fulfill the laws \add that God gave Moses\add*."

\v 31 If you say that God makes us right with himself because we trust in Christ, does that mean that the law is now useless? Certainly not. Instead, that law is truly valid.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul confirms the law though faith.

  * **Do we then nullify the law through faith?** - Paul asks this question to add emphasis. AT: "Should we ignore the law because we have faith?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **May it never be** - This expression gives the strongest possible negative answer to the preceding rhetorical question. You may have a similar express in your language that you could use here. AT: "This is certainly not true!" or "Certainly not!" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **we uphold the law** - "we obey the law"
  * **we** - This pronoun refers to Paul, other believers, and the readers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
