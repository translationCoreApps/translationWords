\v 11 The word of Yahweh came again to me and said,
\v 12 "Son of man, lift up a lament for the king of Tyre and say to him, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: You were the model of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
\v 13 You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone covered you:  ruby, topaz, emerald, chrysolite, onyx, jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and beryl. Your settings and mountings were made from gold. It was on the day you were created that they were prepared.
