\v 25 There was a woman in the crowd who had a bleeding disorder. She had been bleeding every day for twelve years.
\v 26 She had suffered much over the years while doctors treated her. She had spent all her money to pay the doctors and after all they did to her, she got worse instead of better.
\v 27 When she heard that Jesus healed people, she came to where he was and pushed in the crowd close behind Jesus.

\p
\v 25 Now there was a woman who's blood had flowed for twelve years.
\v 26 She had suffered a lot under many doctors and had spent everything that she had. Yet she was helped by nothing, but instead got worse.
\v 27 She had heard reports about Jesus. So she came up behind him when he was walking in the crowd, and she touched his cloak.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Connecting Statement:** - While Jesus is on his way to heal the man's little 12-year-old girl, a woman who has been sick for 12 years interrupts by touching Jesus for her healing.

  * **Now there was a woman** - "Now" indicates that this woman is being introduced to the story. Consider how new characters are introduced into a story in your language. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **who's blood had flowed for twelve years** - The woman did not have an open wound; rather, her monthly flow of blood would not stop. Your language may have a polite way to refer to this condition.(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]]) 
  * **for twelve years** - "for 12 years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **she was helped by nothing** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "nothing had helped her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **but instead got worse** - It may be helpful to add the missing information. AT: "but instead her sickness got worse" or "but instead her bleeding increased" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **reports about Jesus** - She had heard reports about Jesus of how he healed people. AT: "that Jesus healed people" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **cloak** - outer garment or coat
