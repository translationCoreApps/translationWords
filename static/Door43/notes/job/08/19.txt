===== translationNotes: =====

  * **this is the "joy" of such a person's behavior** - Bildad is speaking with irony to express that there is not any real joy for the godless person. AT: "this is all the joy they will receive from their godless actions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **other plants will sprout out of the same soil in his place** - Bildad continues the metaphor from [[:en:bible:notes:job:08:16|08:16-18]]. Other godless people are spoken of as plants who take the place of the first godless man when he dies. AT: "when one wicked man dies, another will take his place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **sprout** - "grow"
  * **the same soil** - "the rocky ground" or "the garden"
  * **in his place** - "in the place of the godless man"
  * **God will not cast away an innocent man** - This can be stated in positive form. AT: "God will accept an innocent man"
  * **neither will he take the hand of evildoers** - Here "take the hand" refers to help or support. AT: "God will not support people who do evil things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
