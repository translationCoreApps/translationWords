====== 1 John 01:8-10 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Those who never behave sinfully are deceiving themselves, and refusing \add to accept as\add* true \add what God says about them\add*.
\v 9 But God will do what he says that he will do, and what he does is\add always\add* right. So, if we confess to him that we \add have behaved\add* sinfully, he will forgive \add us for\add* our sins and will free us from\f + \ft Or: remove \f* \add the guilt of\add* all our sins. \add Because of that\add*, \add we should confess to him that we have behaved sinfully\add*.
\v 10 \add Because God says that everyone has sinned\add*, those who say\f + \ft Or: claim \f* that they have never behaved sinfully talk \add as though\add* God lies! They reject what God says \add about us!\add*

\v 8 Those who say that they have never sinned are deceiving themselves and are refusing to believe what God says about them.
\v 9 But God always does what he says he will do, and what he does is always right. So if we admit to him that we have sinned, he will forgive us for our sins and will free us from the guilt of everything we have done wrong. Because of that, we should admit to him that we have sinned.
\v 10 Because God says that everyone has sinned, those who say that they have never sinned talk as though God lies! They reject what God says about us!

<usfm>
\v 8 If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
\v 9 But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
\v 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar, and his word is not in us.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here the words "he," "him," and "his" refer to God. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:01:05|1:5]])

  * **have no sin** - "never sin"
  * **are deceiving** - "are tricking" or "lying to"
  * **the truth is not in us** - The truth is spoken of as if it were an object that could be inside believers. AT: "we do not believe what is true" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. John uses them to emphasize that God will surely forgive our sins. AT: "and will completely forgive us of what we have done wrong" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **we make him out to be a liar** - we claim that he is a liar AT: "it is the same as calling him a liar, because he said we have all sinned" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **his word is not in us** - Obeying and honoring God's word is spoken of as if his word were inside the believers. AT: "we do not understand God's word nor obey what he says" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
