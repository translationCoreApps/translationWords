<usfm>
\v 25 But Omri did many things that Yahweh said were evil. He did more evil deeds than any of the kings who ruled Israel before he did.
\v 26 When Jeroboam \add was previously the king\add*, he had induced the Israelite people to sin, and Omri committed the same kind of sins that Jeroboam did. The Israelite people caused Yahweh, the God the Israelite people had worshiped, to become very angry, because they worshiped worthless idols.

\v 25 Omri did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh and acted more wickedly than all who had been before him.
\v 26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat and in his sins by which he led Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to be angry with their worthless idols.
