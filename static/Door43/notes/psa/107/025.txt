===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he commanded and aroused the windstorm that stirs up the seas** - "he commanded the wind and caused it become a great windstorm that stirred up the sea" 
  * **windstorm** - a strong wind, like the wind that accompanies a strong rain storm
  * **that stirs up the seas** - Here David describes the winds causing the waves to become high as if the wind was an object fiercely stirring something. AT: "that caused the waves of the sea to become very high" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They reached up to the sky; they went down to the depths** - This describes the ships rising and falling with the waves. The extremes of rising to the sky and falling to the depths are an exaggeration to express how horrible the windstorm was. AT: "their ships would rise very high on the waves and then they would fall very low between the waves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Their lives melted away in distress** - This idiom describes the sailors' great fear. AT: "The men were terrified and greatly distressed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **were at their wits' end** - The phrase "at their wit's end" means that they did not know what to do. AT: "and they did not know what to do" or "they had no idea what to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
