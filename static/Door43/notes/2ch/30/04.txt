\v 4 The king and all the other people who had gathered thought that was a good plan.
\v 5 So they decided to send messages to all the towns in Judah and in Israel, from Beersheba \add in the far south\add* to Dan \add in the far north\add*, including towns in the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, to invite people to come to the temple in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover to \add honor\add* Yahweh, the God whom the Israelite people \add worshiped\add*. Many of the people had not previously celebrated that festival, even though it had been written \add in the laws of Moses that they should do that\add*.

\v 4 The king and all the other people who had gathered thought that this was a good plan.
\v 5 So they decided to send messages to all the cities and villages in Judah and in Israel, from Beersheba in the far south to Dan in the far north, including places in the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, to invite people to come to the temple in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover to honor Yahweh, the God whom the Israelite people worshiped. Many of the people had not previously celebrated that festival, even though it had been written in the law of Moses that they should do that.

\v 4 This proposal seemed right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.
\v 5 So they agreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that the people should come to celebrate the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem. For they had not observed it with large numbers of people, according to what was written.
