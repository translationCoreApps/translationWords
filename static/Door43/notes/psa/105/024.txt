===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh made his people fruitful** - The writer speaks of the increase of Israel as if they were a plant that produced a lot of fruit. "God increased the number of his people greatly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to hate his people, to mistreat his servants** - "to hate his people and to mistreat his servants"
  * **They performed his signs ... his wonders in the land of Ham** - These two phrases have basically the same meaning and are used together for emphasis. AT: "Moses and Aaron performed God's miracles in Egypt among the descendants of Ham" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **his wonders** - The missing words may be added. AT: "and they performed his wonders" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
