\v 36 But Yahweh, who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and a raised arm, is the one you must honor; it is to him that you will prostrate yourselves, and it is to him that you will sacrifice.
\v 37 The statutes and the decrees, the law and the commandments that he wrote for you, you will keep them forever. So you must not fear other gods,
\v 38 and the covenant that I have made with you, you will not forget; neither will you honor other gods.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The summary comes toward the end with an appeal to worship only Yahweh.

  * **with great power and a raised arm** - The phrase "raised arm" is metonymy for displaying power and means basically the same thing as "great power." AT: "with very great power" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **keep them** - "obey them"
