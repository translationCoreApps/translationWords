====== Philippians 04 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "My joy and my crown" ==
Paul considered the Philippians' spiritually maturity an important achievement that he helped to achieve. He takes pride in discipling other Christians and encouraging spirtual growth as an important part of the Christian life. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]] and [[:en:obe:kt:disciple]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Euodia and Syntyche ==
Apparently, there was a disagreement between these two women and Paul was encouraging unity and harmony between them. The exact details of their disagreement is insignificant (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
