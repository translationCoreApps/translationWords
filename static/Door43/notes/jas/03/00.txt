====== James 03 General Notes ======


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
The author uses many different metaphors to convict his readers and to encourage them to display godliness by the way they speak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:godly]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Implicit information ==
What a person says can reveal his spiritual state. This is because his speech can be heard by other people. If a person is unable to control his actions when he is seen by others, he will not be able to control his actions when no one is looking. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
