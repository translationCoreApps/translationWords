===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to remind the people of Israel what Yahweh said to them.

  * **I spoke to you at that time** - Here "I" refers to Moses. The phrase "at that time" refers to when the Israelites were at Horeb, which is the same as Mount Sinai. AT: "When we were at Horeb, I spoke to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I am not able to carry you myself alone** - Here "to carry you" means "to lead you" or "to govern you." AT: "It is too much for me to lead you by myself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **as the multitude of the stars of heaven** - This is an exaggeration that means God has greatly increased the number of Israelites. AT: "a great crowd of many people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **a thousand times** - The phrase "a thousand" is a metaphor for "very many." AT: "very many times" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a thousand** - 1000 (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
