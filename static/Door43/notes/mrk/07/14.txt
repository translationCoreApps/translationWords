  * **Listen to me, all of you, and understand** - The words "Listen" and "understand" are related. Jesus uses them together to emphasize that his hearers should pay close attention to what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])

  * **nothing from outside of a person** - Jesus is speaking about what a person eats. This is in contrast to "what come out of the person." AT: "nothing from outside a person that he can eat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **It is what comes out of the person** - This refers to the things a person does or says. This is in contrast to "what is outside a person that enters into him." AT: "It is what comes out of a person that he says or does" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
