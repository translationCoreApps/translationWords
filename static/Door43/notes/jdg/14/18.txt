\v 18 So before sunset on the seventh day, the young men came to Samson and said to him,
\q1 "Nothing is sweeter than honey;
\q2 Nothing is as strong as a lion."
\p Samson replied, "People use their own animals to plow their fields. My bride is like a young heifer that you have used, but she does not belong to you!
\q1 If you had not forced her to ask me,
\q2 you would not have learned the answer!"
