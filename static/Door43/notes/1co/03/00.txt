====== 1 Corinthians 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 3:19 and 20, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Fleshly people==
The Corinthian believers were immature because of their unrighteous actions. He calls them "fleshly," meaning thinking as a nonbeliever. This term is used in opposition to those who are "spiritual." Christians following their "flesh" are foolish and they are following the wisdom of the world. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:unrighteous]], [[:en:obe:kt:flesh]], [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]], [[:en:obe:kt:foolish]] and [[:en:obe:kt:wise]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
There are many metaphors in this chapter. He uses "babies" and "milk" as illustrations of spiritual immaturity. Paul uses the metaphors of planting and watering, to describe the roles he and Apollos played in growing the church in Corinth. Paul also uses many other metaphors to help teach spiritual truths to the Corinthians to help them to understand his teachings. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
