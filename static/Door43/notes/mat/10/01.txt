===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This begins an account of Jesus sending out his twelve disciples to do his work.

  * **called his twelve disciples together** - "summoned his 12 disciples" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **gave them authority** - Be sure that the text clearly communicates that this authority was 1) to drive out unclean spirits and 2) to heal disease and sickness.
  * **to drive them out** - "to make the unclean spirits leave"
  * **all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness** - "every disease and every sickness." The words "disease" and "sickness" are closely related but should be translated as two different words if possible. "Disease" is what causes a person to be sick. "Sickness" is the physical weakness or affliction that results from having a disease.
