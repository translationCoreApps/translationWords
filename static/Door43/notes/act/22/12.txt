  * **General Information:** - The words "He" and "him" refer to Ananias.

  * **Ananias** - Though this is not the same Ananias who died earlier in Acts [[:en:bible:notes:act:05:03|5:3]], you may translate it the same way though as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:act:05:01|5:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **devout man according to the law** - Ananias was very serious about following God's law.
  * **well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Jews who lived there spoke well of him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Brother Saul** - Here "Brother" is a polite way to address someone. AT: "My friend Saul" (UDB)
  * **receive your sight** - The word"sight" can be translated with the verb "see." AT: "see again" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
