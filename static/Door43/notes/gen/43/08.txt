\v 8 Then Judah said to his father Jacob, "Send the boy with me, and we will go immediately, in order that we and you and our children may get grain and not die from hunger.
\v 9 I myself will guarantee that he will return. You can require me to do what I am promising [IDI]. If I do not bring him back to you safely, you can say forever that I am to blame\f + \ft Or: it was my fault that he did not return to you \f*.
\v 10 If we had not wasted so much time\f + \ft Or: waited so long \f*, by now we could have gone there and returned two times!"

\v 8 Judah said to Israel his father, "Send the boy with me. We will rise and go that we may live and not die, both we, you, and also our children.
\v 9 I will be a guarantee for him. You will hold me responsible. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever.
\v 10 For if we had not delayed, surely by now we would have come back here a second time."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **We will rise and go that we may live and not die, both we, you, and also our children** - The phrases "we may live" and "not die" mean the same thing. Judah is emphasizing that they have to buy food in Egypt in order to survive. AT: "We will go now to Egypt and get grain so our whole family will live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **We will rise** - Here "We" refers to the brothers who will travel to Egypt. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **we may live** - Here "we" refers to the brothers, Israel, and the whole family. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **both we** - Here "we" refers to the brothers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **we, you** - Here "you" is singular and refers to Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **also our children** - Here "our" refers to the brothers. This refers to the small children who were most likely to die during a famine. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **I will be a guarantee for him** - The abstract noun "guarantee" can be stated as the verb "promise." AT: "I will promise to bring him back" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **You will hold me responsible** - How Jacob will hold Judah responsible can be stated clearly. AT: "You will make me answer to you about what happens to Benjamin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **let me bear the blame** - This speaks about "blame" as if it were an object that a person has to carry. AT: "you may blame me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For if we had not delayed** - Judah is describing something that could have happened in the past but did not. Judah is scolding his father for waiting so long to send his sons to Egypt to get more food. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **we would have come back here a second time** - "we would have returned twice"
