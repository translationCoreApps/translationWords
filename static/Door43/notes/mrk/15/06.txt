===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Pilate, hoping the crowd would choose Jesus, offered to release a prisoner, but the crowd asked for Barabbas instead.

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline as the author shifts to telling background information about Pilate's tradition of releasing a prisoner at feasts and about Barabbas. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **There with the rebels in prison ... in the rebellion, was a man named Barabbas** - "At that time there was a man called Barabbas, who was in prison with some other men. They had committed murder when they rebelled against the Roman government" (UDB)
  * **to do for them as he had done in the past** - This refers to Pilate releasing a prisoner at feasts. This can be made clear. AT: "to release a prisoner to them as he had done in the past" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
