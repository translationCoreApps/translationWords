===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The Levites must place their hands on the heads of the bulls** - This is a symbolic action that identifies the Levites with the animals being offered. In this way the person is offering himself through the animal to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **lift them up as a wave offering to me** - Aaron was to present the Levites to Yahweh as if he were lifting up an offering to Yahweh. AT: "dedicate them to me, as if you were lifting them up a wave offering to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
