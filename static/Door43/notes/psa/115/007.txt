===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Idols have hands** - The idols do not have real hands, feet, or mouths. Rather, people made them with the likeness of hands, feet, and mouths. The writer is emphasizing that these idols are not really alive. AT: "People have given hands to those idols" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Those who make them are like them, as is everyone who trusts in them** - Those who make and worship idols become lifeless and powerless, just like those idols. AT: "Those who make them become lifeless like they are, as does everyone who trusts in them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
