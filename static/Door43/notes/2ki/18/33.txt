Did any god rescue Samaria from my power?
\v 35 No, none of the gods of the countries \add that my army attacked\add* rescued their people \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* from me! So why do you think that Yahweh will rescue you people of Jerusalem from my power \f + \ft metonymy \f*?'~"

\v 35 None of these gods kept their people from being destroyed by the king of Assyria. Do you think your God Yahweh, can do any better?
