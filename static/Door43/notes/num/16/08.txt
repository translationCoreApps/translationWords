\v 8 Then Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* spoke again to Korah. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* said, "You men who are descendants of Levi, listen to me!
\v 9 The God of us Israelites has chosen all of you to be close to him in order that you can work for him at his Sacred Tent and serve the people. Does that seem to be unimportant\f + \ft Or: mean nothing \f* to you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\v 10 Yahweh has brought you, \add Korah\add*, and your fellow descendants of Levi, near to himself. Now are you demanding to become priests also?
\v 11 It is really Yahweh against whom you and your fellow descendants of Levi are rebelling. Aaron is not the one about whom you are really complaining \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*."

\v 8 Then Moses spoke again to Korah. He said, "You men who are descendants of Levi, listen to me!
\v 9 You know that Yahweh, the God of Israel has chosen you Levites from the community of Israel so you can work for him at his sacred tent and serve the people. Does that seem to you like a small thing for you to do?
\v 10 Yahweh has brought you, Korah, and your fellow descendants of Levi, near to himself. Now are you demanding to become priests also?
\v 11 It is really Yahweh against whom you and your fellow descendants of Levi are rebelling. Aaron is not the one about whom you are really complaining."

\v 8 Again, Moses said to Korah, "Now listen, you descendants of Levi:
\v 9 is it a small thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the community of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do work in Yahweh's tabernacle, and to stand before the community to serve them?
\v 10 He has brought you near, and all your kinfolk, the descendants of Levi, with you, yet you are seeking the priesthood also!
\v 11 That is why you and all your group have gathered together against Yahweh. So why are you complaining about Aaron, who obeys Yahweh?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **is it a small thing for you ... to serve them?** - Moses uses this question to rebuke Korah and the men with him. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "You behave as though it it is a small thing for you ... to serve them" or "You should not consider it a small thing ... to serve them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **a small thing for you** - "not enough for you" or "unimportant to you"
  * **you are seeking the priesthood also** - Wanting to have the priesthood is spoken of as if they were looking for it.  AT:  "you want to have the priesthood too" or "you want to be priests also" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **So why are you complaining about Aaron, who obeys Yahweh?** - Moses uses this question to show them that when they complain about what Aaron does, they are really complaining against Yahweh, because Aaron was doing what Yahweh told him to do. AT: "You are not really complaining about Aaron, but about Yahweh, whom Aaron obeys." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
