====== 2 Corinthians 01:19-20 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 \add I follow the example of\add* God's Son, Jesus Christ. When I, along with Silas and Timothy, taught you \add about Christ\add*, we told you that he was not \add someone who said that he\add* would do \add something\add* and \add then\add* did not \add do it\add*. Jesus Christ never \add said to anyone\add*, "Yes, \add I will do what you desire\add*," and \add then did\add* not \add do it\add*.
\v 20 \add We\f + \ft inclusive \f* know that is true\add*, because everything that God promised to do \add for his people\add*, he has done completely by \add sending\add* Christ \add to save us\add*. That is why we say, "Yes, it is true! \add God has done everything that he promised to do!\add*" And we praise him!

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 Our "Yes" comes from the Son of God, Jesus Christ—the one we proclaimed to you; and there has never been any confusion in him—with him there is no "Yes and then No." Instead, it has always been simply "Yes" in him.
\v 20 For the promises of God are "Yes" because they come from him. And we add our confirmation to his "Yes." And we say about God's honor: "It is True! Yes!"
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom Silvanus, Timothy and I proclaimed among you, is not "Yes" and "No." Instead, he is always "Yes."
\v 20 For all the promises of God are "Yes" in him.  So also through him we say "Amen" to the glory of God.
