\v 12 If he is a poor man, you must not sleep with his pledge in your possession.
\v 13 You must surely restore to him the pledge by the time the sun goes down, so that he may sleep in his cloak and bless you; it will be righteousness for you before Yahweh your God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **you must not sleep with his pledge in your possession** - "you must not keep his coat overnight"
  * **his pledge** - This is a metonym for "what he has promised that he would give you if he did not pay back the loan" Translate as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:24:10|24:10]] (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **restore to him the pledge** - "give him back what he has given you to show that he will pay back the loan"
  * **so that he may sleep in his cloak and bless you** - The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "so that he will have his coat to keep himself warm when he sleeps, and he will be grateful to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **cloak** - a coat or other clothing that keeps a person warm at night. This was probably the "pledge" Moses was speaking of in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:24:10|24:10-12]]
  * **it will be righteousness for you before Yahweh your God** - "Yahweh your God will approve of the way you handled this matter"
