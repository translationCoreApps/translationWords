====== Ecclesiastes 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:10-26, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Pleasures ==
When the author thought about the pointlessness of life, he decided to full it with pointless pleasures. He believed that this type of living would have no effect on the world. Therefore, he indulged in every type of pleasure.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Assumed knowledge ==
It is assumed that the author is going to reject the way of living in this chapter. He is certainly not encouraging this way of living even though he does not say this explicitly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
