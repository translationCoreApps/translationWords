====== Deuteronomy 12 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Covenant with Moses ==

This chapter is a continuation of the covenant Yahweh made with Moses. The reasons for these food restrictions are not always known.(See: [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== Israel and Yahweh ==

In the ancient Near East, when nations conquered other nations, they often added the gods of the conquered nation into their collection of gods they worshiped. It was rare to worship only one God. Israel was to be know for worshiping Yahweh and Yahweh alone. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]])
