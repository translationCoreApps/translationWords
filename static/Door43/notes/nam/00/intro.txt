=== What is Book of Nahum about? ===

The Book of Nahum was about the coming destruction of Nineveh, the capital city of the Assyrian Empire. The prophecy ends with a celebration by the prophet Nahum and the enemies of Assyria. The book's purpose was to give hope to Judah.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may decided to translate this traditional title "The book of Nahum" in a way that is more clear to the readers. They may decide to call it, "The sayings of Nahum." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Nahum? ===

It is probable that Nahum wrote this book. He was a prophet from Elkosh, an unknown city which was probably in Judah. The book was written before the fall of Nineveh in about 612 BC. The prophet also mentions the destruction of Thebes, a city in Egypt, which occurred about 663 BC. This fact allow us to have an approximate date for the Book of Nahum. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is the importance of the descriptions of locusts in 3:15–17? ===

Locust attacks occurred all too frequently in the Ancient Near East. Certain kinds of grasshoppers would come in countless numbers, darkening the distant sky like a black cloud that blotted out the sunlight. They often came after a prolonged period of no rain. They came down on whatever crops were surviving in the fields and stripped them bare of their leaves. The locusts were irresistible and always brought catastrophe with them. For this reason locust attacks served as a very powerful image of military attacks in the Old Testament.

Locust attacks are frequently mentioned in the Old Testament, sometimes as threatened punishment from God, as, for example, one of the ten plagues that he inflicted on Egypt. 

There are various names for locusts in the original language of the Old Testament. It is uncertain whether these refer to different kinds of locusts or to the same kind of locust in different stages of growth. For this reason, versions of the Bible differ in how they translate these terms.
===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What emotions are present in the various speakers in the Book of Nahum? ===

Nahum's message presents the prophet speaking to the people of Israel and both the prophet and Yahweh speaking to the city of Nineveh. In speaking to the Israelites, the prophet wants to comfort them. However, when speaking to the people of Nineveh, the prophet and Yahweh bring harsh judgment that is often mixed with mockery. This is similar to the custom in the ancient Near East, where it was usual for conquerors to laugh at their victims. It is important for translators to represent well both the emotion of comfort and of mockery in translation.
