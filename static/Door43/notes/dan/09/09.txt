\v 9 Although we have rebelled against you, you act mercifully toward us and you are willing to forgive us.
\v 10 When you gave your laws to your prophets who served you, and they told us to live our lives according to those laws, we did not listen to the voice of Yahweh our God.
\v 11 All Israel has disobeyed your law, and we have turned away from it and have refused to do what you told us to do. Because we have sinned against you, you have sent to us the terrible things that your servant Moses said would happen to us if we sinned against you.

<usfm>
\v 9 To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him.
\v 10 We have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God by walking in his laws he gave us through his servants the prophets.
\v 11 All Israel has transgressed your law and turned aside, refusing to obey your voice. The curse and oath that are written in the law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, for we have sinned against him.
