\v 32 The people of Egypt considered that it was disgraceful for them to eat with Hebrews, so the servants served food to Joseph by himself, and served the other people of Egypt who ate with him by themselves, and they served Joseph's older brothers and younger brother by themselves.
\v 33 His brothers were astonished to see that their seats were arranged according to their ages, from the youngest to the oldest!
\v 34 And when their portions of food were served to them from Joseph's table, Benjamin's portion was five times as much as anyone else's portion! So they ate food and drank wine with Joseph until they became very cheerful.

\v 32 The servants served Joseph by himself and the brothers by themselves. The Egyptians there ate with him by themselves because the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is detestable to the Egyptians.
\v 33 The brothers sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth. The men were astonished together.
\v 34 Joseph sent portions to them from the food in front of him. But Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of his brothers. They drank and were merry with him.

  * **The servants served Joseph by himself and the brothers by themselves. The Egyptians there ate with him by themselves** - This means that Joseph, the brothers, and the other Egyptians are eating in three different places within the same room. AT: "The servants served Joseph by himself and the brothers by themselves and the Egyptians, who were eating with him, by themselves"
  * **The Egyptians there ate with him by themselves** - These are probably other Egyptian officials who ate with Joseph, but they still sat separately from him and the Hebrew brothers.
  * **because the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is detestable to the Egyptians** - This can be translated as a new sentence: "They did this because the Egyptians thought it was shameful to eat with the Hebrews"
  * **could not eat bread** - Here "bread" stands for food in general. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **The brothers sat before him** - It is implied that Joseph had arranged where each brother would sit. You can make clear the implied information. AT: "The brothers sat across from the man, according to how he arranged their places" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth** - The "firstborn" and the "youngest" are used together to mean all the brothers were sitting in order according to their age. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **The men were astonished together** - "The men were very surprised when they realized this"
  * **But Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of his brothers** - The phrase "five times" can be stated more generally. AT: "But Benjamin received a portion that was much bigger than what his brothers received"
