<usfm>
\v 17 After Jehoiada died, the leaders of Judah went to Joash, bowed in front of him, and persuaded him to do what they wanted.
\v 18 So they and the other people stopped worshiping at the temple, and they started worshiping the poles dedicated to \add the goddess\add* Asherah and other idols. Because of their doing those sinful things, God was very angry with the people of Jerusalem and \add with the people in other places in\add* Judah.
\v 19 Although Yahweh sent prophets to persuade them to return to him, and although the prophets testified about the \add evil things that they had done\add*, the people would not pay attention.

\v 17 Now after the death of Jehoiada, the leaders of Judah came and did honor to the king. Then the king listened to them.
\v 18 They forsook the house of Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, and worshiped the Asherah gods and the idols. God's anger came on Judah and Jerusalem for this wrongdoing of theirs.
\v 19 Yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again to himself, Yahweh; the prophets testified against the people, but they refused to listen.
