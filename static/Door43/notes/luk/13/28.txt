\v 28 Then Jesus continued by saying, "\add From where God will send you\add*, you will see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the distance. All the prophets \add who lived long ago will also be there\add*, in the kingdom where God \add is ruling\add*. But you will be outside, crying and grinding your teeth \add because you will have severe pain!\add*
\v 29 Furthermore, many \add non-Jewish\add* people will \add be inside\add*. There will be ones who have come from \add lands to\add* the north, east, south, and west. They will be feasting in that place where God is ruling\f + \ft Or: God's kingdom \f*.
\v 30 Think about this: Some people whom others do not \add consider\add* important \add now, God will make\add* them very important \add then\add*, and some people whom \add others consider\add* very important \add now, God will make\add* to be not important \add then\add*."

\v 28 Then Jesus continued by saying, "You will see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the distance. All the prophets who lived long ago will also be there, where God will rule everything as king. But you will be outside, crying and grinding your teeth in pain!
\v 29 Furthermore, many non-Jewish people will be inside. There will be ones who have come from lands to the north, east, south, and west. They will be feasting to celebrate that God is ruling everything.
\v 30 Think about this: Some people who seem the least important now will be the most important then, and others who seem important now, will be the least important then."

\v 28 There will be crying and the grinding of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in God's kingdom, but you are thrown out.
\v 29 They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and be seated at a table in the kingdom of God.
\v 30 Know this, those who are least important will be first, and those who are most important will be last."
