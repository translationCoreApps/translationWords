===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues telling the people what Yahweh wants them to do.

  * **before Yahweh** - "in the presence of Yahweh" or "to Yahweh"
  * **lay his hand on the head** - This is a symbolic action that identifies the person with the animal he is offering. In this way the person is offering himself to Yahweh through the animal. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:01:03|1:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **Aaron's sons the priests will sprinkle its blood** - It is implied that before they sprinkle the blood, they catch blood in a bowl as the it drains from the animal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
