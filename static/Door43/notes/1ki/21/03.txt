\v 3 Naboth replied to Ahab, "May Yahweh forbid that I should give the inheritance of my ancestors to you."
\v 4 So Ahab went into his palace resentful and angry because of the answer Naboth the Jezreelite gave him when he said, "I will not give you the inheritance of my ancestors." He lay down on his bed, turned away his face, and refused to eat any food.
