\v 3 God wants you to do no sin, living in a way that will show that you completely belong to him. He wants you to avoid doing any sexually immoral acts.
\v 4 That is, he wants each one of you to know how to live with your wife, in a way that honors her and you do not sin against her.
\v 5 You must not use her to satisfy your lustful desires (as non-Jews do because they do not know God).
\v 6 God wants each one of you to control your sexual desires, in order that no one of you sin against your fellow believer and take advantage of him or her by doing things like that. Remember that we strongly warned you previously that the Lord Jesus will punish all people who commit sexually immoral acts.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 For this is the will of God, your sanctification, that you avoid sexual immorality,
\v 4 that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in holiness and honor,
\v 5 not in the passion of lust (as the Gentiles who do not know God).
\v 6 Let no man transgress and wrong his brother in this matter. For the Lord is an avenger in all these things, just as we forewarned you and testified.
