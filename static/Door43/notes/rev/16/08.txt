<usfm>
\v 8 Then the fourth angel poured out on the sun what was contained in his bowl. He was given permission to make the sun so hot that it would scorch people with fire.
\v 9 So the people were severely burned, and they said evil things about God because he had the power to make them suffer in these ways. But they still refused to turn away from their evil behavior and refused to praise him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **poured out his bowl** - The word "bowl" refers to what is in it. AT: "poured out the wine from his bowl" or "poured out God's wrath from his bowl." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:16:02|16:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **it was given permission to scorch the people** - John speaks about the sun as if it were a person. This can be stated in active form. AT: "and caused the sun to severely burn the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **They were scorched by the terrible heat** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The extreme heat burned them badly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they blasphemed the name of God** - Here the name of God represents God. AT: "they blasphemed God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **who has the power over these plagues** - This phrase reminds readers of something they already know about God. It helps to explain why the people were blaspheming God. AT: "because he has the power over these plagues" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])
  * **the power over these plagues** - This refers to the power to inflict these plagues on people, and the power to stop the plagues. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
