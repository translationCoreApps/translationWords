\v 20 Almost eleven years after the Babylonians took us Israelites to their country, Yahweh gave me another message on the seventh day of the first month of that year. He said,
\v 21 "Son of man, I have enabled the army of Nebuchadnezzar to defeat the army of the king of Egypt. It is as though I have broken one of the arms of the king of Egypt, and it has not been bandaged in order that it could be healed, and it has not been put in splints in order that after it heals the arm will be strong enough to hold a sword.

\v 20 Then it came about in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 21 "Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Behold! It has not been bound up, or set to heal with a bandage, so that it will become strong enough to grasp a sword.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - God speaks of making Pharaoh's army weak as if he were to break Pharaoh's arm, and of the army not being able to become strong again as if Pharaoh's arm could not be healed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **Then it came about** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])
  * **in the eleventh year** - This is the eleventh year after King Jehoiachin was taken into exile in Babylon. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:26:01|26:1]]. 
  * **in the first month, in the seventh day of the month** - "in the seventh day of the first month." This is the first month of the Hebrew calendar. The seventh day is near the beginning of April on Western calendars. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **I have broken the arm of Pharaoh** - Here "arm" represents the powerful army of a king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **Behold** - "Look" or "Listen." This word adds emphasis to what is said next. AT: "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you."
  * **It has not been bound up** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "No one has bound up his arm" or "No one has wrapped us his arm" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **or set to heal with a bandage** - Here "set to heal with a bandage" refers to the arm being wrapped tightly in a bandage so that the parts of the bone will stay together and heal.
