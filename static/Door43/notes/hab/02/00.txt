====== Habakkuk 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:1-20, which are extended quotations.

This chapter is arranged in a series of questions and answers between Yahweh and Habakkuk.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "The righteous will live by his faith" ==
This is an important phrase in Scripture. Paul also uses it to explain that man is justified by his faith. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]], [[:en:obe:kt:justify]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])
