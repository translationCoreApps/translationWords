\v 13 I have written this letter to you who believe that Jesus is the Son of God, in order that you may know that you will live forever.
\v 14 Because we are joined with him, we are very confident that he hears us when we ask him to do anything he approves of.
\v 15 Also, if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—then we can be sure that we will receive whatever we asked from him.
