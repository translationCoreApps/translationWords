====== Genesis 35 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Name change ==

In Scripture, a change in name always occurs at a highly significant point in a person's life. The return of Jacob to Canaan was a significant event in the history of the Hebrew people.

== Covenant ==
The covenant God made with Abraham is repeated here. It indicates that all of Jacob's descendants will inherit the promises of this covenant. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]], [[:en:obe:kt:inherit]] and [[:en:obe:kt:promise]])
