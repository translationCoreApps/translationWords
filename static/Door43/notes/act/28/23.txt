\v 23 So they decided that they would come back on another day to hear Paul speak to them. When that day arrived, even more people than before came to where Paul was staying. Paul told them about how God would rule everyone; he talked about how the law of Moses and the prophets foretold Jesus. Paul talked with all who would listen from morning until evening.
\v 24 Some of those Jews were persuaded to believe what Paul said about Jesus was true, but others did not believe that it was true.
