\v 28 The girl ran and told everyone in her mother's household about what had happened.
\v 29 Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban. Laban went quickly to the servant, who was outside by the well.
\v 30 He was surprised to have seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms and to have heard Rebekah tell what the man had said to her. So he went out and saw the man standing near the camels, close to the well.

\v 28 Then the young woman ran and told her mother's household about all of these things.
\v 29 Now Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran to the man who was out at the road by the spring.
\v 30 When he had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister, "This is what the man said to me," he went to the man, and, behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **ran and told her mother's household** - Here "household" stands for all the people living in her mother's house. AT: "ran to the house and told her mother and everyone there" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **all of these things** - "everything that had just happened"
  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here the author tells background information about Rebekah. The author introduces her brother, Laban, to the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **When he had seen the nose ring ... and when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister** - These things happened before he ran out to the man. This tells why Laban ran out to the man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_events]])
  * **when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister, "This is what the man said to me,"** - This can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "when he had heard his sister Rebekah tell what the man had said to her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
