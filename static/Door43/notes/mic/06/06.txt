\v 6 What should I bring to Yahweh,
\q as I bow down to the high God?
\q Should I come to him with burnt offerings,
\q with calves a year old?
\q
\v 7 Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams,
\q or with ten thousand rivers of oil?
\q Should I give my firstborn for my transgression,
\q the fruit of my body for my own sin?
\q
\v 8 He has told you, man,
\q what is good,
\q and what Yahweh requires from you:
\q Act justly,
\q love kindness,
\q and walk humbly with your God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **What should I bring to Yahweh, as I bow down to the high God? Should I come to him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousand rivers of oil? Should I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for my own sin?** - Micah uses questions to teach the people of Israel about what is really pleasing to God. AT: "Surely you do not think that you can please God by bringing him a year-old calf, 1,000 rams, 10,000 rivers of oil, or even your firstborn child as a sacrifice for your sins." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for my own sin** - These two phrases mean the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He has told you** - "Yahweh has told you"
