  * **General Information:** - The writer continues to describe what God did for the people of Israel.

  * **He handed his people over to the sword** - Asaph speaks of God's people as if they were a small object God would give as a gift, and of the sword, a metonym for death in war, as if it were a person who could receive a gift. AT: "He allowed people to kill all his people in war" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he was angry with his heritage** - "he was angry with the people he had said would be his forever"
  * **Fire devoured their young men** - Possible meanings are 1) "The enemy used fire to kill all their young men" or 2) "Their young men died quickly in battle like a fire burns dry grass." Do not communicate that these people used guns. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **devoured** - To "devour" is to eat everything very quickly.
  * **wedding** - the celebration when people marry
