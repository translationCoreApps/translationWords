===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues speaking to the crowd and now also to the Jewish leaders.

  * **draws** - This can mean 1) "pulls" or 2) "attracts."
  * **It is written in the prophets** - This is a passive statement that can be translated in an active form. AT: "The prophets wrote" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me** - The Jews thought Jesus was the "son of Joseph" (see [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:41|John 6:42]]), but he is the Son of God because his Father is God, not Joseph. Those who truly learn from God the Father believe in Jesus, who is God the Son.
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
