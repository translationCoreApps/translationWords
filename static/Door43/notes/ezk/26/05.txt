<usfm>
\v 5 Out in the sea, the part of your city that is on an island will become a place where men spread their fishing nets to dry them. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh the Lord, have predicted it: People from many nations will carry off everything of value in your city.
\v 6 The people in small villages on the coast near Tyre—your enemies will kill them with their swords. Then people will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.'

  * **a place for nets to dry out in the midst of the sea** - Part of Tyre was an island. This expression is a metonym for the results of Tyre's destruction.

  * **she will become plunder for the nations** - "Plunder" means things that people steal or take by force. Here Tyre becoming plunder represents its wealth being carried off by other nations.

AT: "Her daughter communities who are on the mainland" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **know that I am Yahweh** - When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power.
