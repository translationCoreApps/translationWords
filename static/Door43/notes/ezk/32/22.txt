===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel about nations in Sheol. Because what God is showing Ezekiel may be for future time, either the present tense (as in the ULB), or the future tense (as in the UDB) is suitable for these verses and the following verses.

  * **Assyria is there with all her assembly** - The land of Assyria is represented as a woman. AT: "The people of Assyria and all its army are there in Sheol" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **her assembly** - "all her people together"
  * **all of them were killed by the sword** - This can be put in active form. AT: "The sword killed them all" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **all of them were killed by the sword** - The sword represents battle. AT: "all of them died by the sword" or "all of them had died in battle." See how you translated "who had been killed by the sword" in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:31:17|31:17]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **are set in the recesses of the pit** - "The pit" refers to the grave; because the grave was thought to be the entrance to the world of the dead, the pit also represents that world. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:32:17|32:18]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **all of those who were killed, who fell by the sword** - This can be put in active form. AT: "all those whom enemies killed in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **those who brought terror on the land of the living** - Terror or fear is spoken of as if it were an object that someone could carry to another place. AT: "those who, when they were still alive, caused people to be extremely afraid" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the land of the living** - This represents the people who were alive. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
