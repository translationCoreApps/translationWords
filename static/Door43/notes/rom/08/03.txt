\v 3 What \add we\add* could not do \add by trying to obey\add* the laws \add of God\add* \f + \ft personification \f*, because our self-directed nature was too weak \add to obey them\add*, God did. He sent his own Son \add into the world in order that his Son might atone\add* for our sin. His Son came having a body \f + \ft Or: human nature \f* that was like \add the body\add* \f + \ft Or: the \add human nature\add* \f* of us people who sin. \add By sending his Son in this way\add*, he condemned and punished \add his Son, who never sinned, instead of punishing us, who\add* sinned \f + \ft metonymy \f*. He did that \add by making his Son's\add* body \add a sacrifice\add* \f + \ft Or: \add by causing his Son's\add* body \add to suffer\f + \ft Or: die \f*\add* \f* for \add all our\add* sin.
\v 4 So we can \add now\add* fulfill all that God required in his laws. We do this, not by our acting the way our sinful human nature \add desires\add*, but instead by living as \add God's\add* Spirit \add desires us to live\add*.
\v 5 People who live according to what their self-directed nature \add desires\add* think about and are concerned about what their self-directed nature \add desires\add*. But people who \add live\add* according to what \add God's\add* Spirit \add desires think about and are concerned about\add* what \add God's\add* Spirit \add desires\add*.

\v 3 We tried to obey God's law in order to live with God, but it was useless to think that we couldâ€”we could not stop sinning. So God helped us instead: he sent his own Son into the world in order that his Son might atone for our sin. His Son came having a body that was like the body of us who sin. His Son came to offer himself as a sacrifice for our sin. When he did this, he also showed that our sins are truly wicked, and that anyone who sins deserves to be punished.
\v 4 So we can now fulfill all that God required in his law. We do this, not by our acting the way our old evil attitude desires, but instead by living as God's Spirit desires us to live.
\v 5 People who live by their evil attitudes think about pay attention to those attitudes. But people who live by what God's Spirit wants think about the things of the Spirit instead.

\v 3 For what the law was unable to do because it was weak through the flesh, God did. He sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be an offering for sin, and he condemned sin in the flesh.
\v 4 He did this in order that the requirements of the law might be fulfilled in us, we who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
\v 5 Those who live according to the flesh pay attention to the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit pay attention to the things of the Spirit.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For what the law was unable to do because it was weak through the flesh, God did** - Here the law is described as a person who could not break the power of sin.

But God did stop us from sinning" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **through the flesh** - "because of people's sinful nature"
  * **He ... sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh ... an offering for sin ... he condemned sin** - The Son of God forever satisfied God's holy anger against our sin by giving his own body and human life as the eternal sacrifice for sin.
  * **Son** - This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **in the likeness of sinful flesh** - "who looked like any other sinful human being"
  * **to be an offering for sin** - "so that he could die as a sacrifice for our sins"
