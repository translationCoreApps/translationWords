\q2 Do not correct\f + \ft Or: punish \f* us when you are angry,

<usfm>
\q
\v 23 I know, Yahweh, that a man's path does not come from himself. No person walking directs his own steps.
\q
\v 24 Discipline me, Yahweh, with justice, not in your anger or you would destroy me.
\q
\v 25 Pour your fury on the nations that do not know you and on the families that do not call on your name.
\q For they have devoured Jacob and consumed him so as to completely destroy him and demolish his habitation.
</usfm>

  * [[:en:obe:other:family]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:call]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:devour]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Pour your fury on the nations** - AT: "Punish the people of the nations severely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **devoured Jacob and consumed him so as to completely destroy him** - Here the words "devour" and "consume" both mean the same thing as "completely destroy." Jeremiah repeats this idea three times to emphasize the utter destruction of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **demolish his habitation** - "demolish the land where he lives"
