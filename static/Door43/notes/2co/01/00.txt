====== 2 Corinthians 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The first paragraph is a reflection of a common way to begin a letter in the ancient Near East. 

This chapter begins with a much softer tone than any of the chapters in Paul's earlier letter to the Corinthian church, known as First Corinthians. 

== Paul's integrity ==
People have been criticizing Paul and saying he is not sincere. He refutes them by explaining his motives for what he is doing.  

=== Special Concepts ===

== Comfort ==
This is a major theme of this chapter. Comforting Christians is a work of the Holy Spirit. It is probable that there was some affliction and the Corinthians needed to be comforted.  

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical question ==

Paul uses two rhetorical questions for the purpose of defending himself against a charge of insincerity. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== We ==
It is likely that Paul's usage of the pronoun "we" represents at least Timothy and himself. It is possible that it may also include other people. 

== Guarantee ==

The Holy Spirit is said to be the guarantee, pledge or down-payment of a Christian's eternal life. While a Christian's salvation is secure, they do not get to experience the promises given to them until after their death. It is only then that they will experience their receiving of the gift of eternal life. The Holy Spirit is shown here to be a personal guarantee that this will happen. This concept comes from a business term whereby a person would give some valuable item to another person as a "guarantee" that they would repay money. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:eternity]] and [[:en:obe:kt:save]])
