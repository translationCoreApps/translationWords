====== 1 John 04 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Spirit ==
This single word is used in many different ways in this chapter. It is used to reference non-physical things, specifically "spirits" who bears witness in some way in "spiritual" or religious matters. The "Spirit of God" is God. The "spirit" of the antichrist is that which is typical of the Antichrist. This is the same way it is used in the phrases the "spirit of truth" and the "spirit of error." (See: [[:en:obe:kt:antichrist]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Loving God ==
If a person loves God, this should be displayed in the way they live their life and the way they treat other people. It is not necessary to conclude the christian's salvation is dependent upon these behaviors. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:save]])
