\v 5 Saul asked him, "Lord, who are you?" He replied, "I am Jesus, whom you are hurting.
\v 6 Now stand up and go into the city! Someone there will tell you what I want you to do."
\v 7 The men who were traveling with Saul were so astonished that they could not say anything. They just stood there. They heard the Lord speak, but they did not see anyone.

\v 5 Saul replied, "Who are you, Lord?" The Lord said, "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting;
\v 6 but rise, enter into the city, and it will be told you what you must do."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Every occurrence of the word "you" here is singular.

  * **Who are you, Lord?** - Saul was not acknowledging that Jesus is the Lord. He uses that title because he understood that he spoke to someone of supernatural power.
  * **but rise, enter into the city** - "get up and go into the city Damascus"
  * **it will be told you** - This can be stated in the active form. AT: "someone will tell you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **hearing the voice, but seeing no one** - "they heard the voice, but they did not see anyone"
  * **but seeing no one** - "but saw no one." Apparently only Saul experienced the light.
