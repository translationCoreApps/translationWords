\v 33-34 After \add Judas and Silas\add* had stayed there for some time \add and were ready to return to Jerusalem\add*, the believers \add at Antioch\add* wished them well, and the believers \add prayed that God\add* would protect \add them as they traveled. So the two men\add* started to go back to the leaders \add in Jerusalem\add* who had asked them to go \add to Antioch\add*.\f + \fqa just before they left\fqa*, Silas decided to stay there \fqa in Antioch\fqa*." Each translator should choose between this text and the implied information that we have given in verse 40. Each should choose the way to translate that seems the most preferable.\f*
\v 35 However, Paul and Barnabas continued to stay in Antioch. \add While they were there\add*, they, along with many others, were teaching \add people\add* and preaching to them the message about the Lord \add Jesus\add*.
