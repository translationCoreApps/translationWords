===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they went on the road** - "they continued to travel along the road"
  * **there is water here** - It is unclear whether this "water" was a stream, or a pool of water, or a larger body. We do know it was deep enough for them to go down into it. Choose an appropriate term in your language.
  * **What prevents me from being baptized?** - The eunuch uses this question as a way of asking Philip for permission to be baptized. AT: "Please allow me to be baptized" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **commanded the chariot to stop** - "told the driver of the chariot to stop"
