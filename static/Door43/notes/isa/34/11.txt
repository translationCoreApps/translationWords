===== translationNotes: =====

  * **will live there** - "will live in the land of Edom"
  * **owl** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:13:21|13:21]].
  * **raven** - a black bird. It is difficult to identify some of the precise kinds of birds mentioned in this passage. However, they were all birds that preferred to live in places where there were no people, so they symbolize deserted places.
  * **He will stretch over it the measuring line of ruin and the plumbline of destruction** - This compares God carefully judging the people of Edom to a builder carefully using tools to measure something. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **measuring line ... plumbline** - See how you tranlated similar words in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:28:17|28:17]].
  * **Her nobles ... her princes** - "The nobles of Edom ... the princes of Edom"
