====== Amos 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter consists of oracles against Moab and Judah by using poetic language and imagery. But the UDB translates it using prose. If possible, translate this chapter as poetry, but you may translate as narrative. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Idiom ==
You will notice that the phrase ""For three sins of Judah, even for four," is used to begin each of these oracles. This is not intended to be a literal count but is an idiom showing a large number of sins. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])
