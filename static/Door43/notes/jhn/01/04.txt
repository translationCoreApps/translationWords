===== translationNotes: =====

  * **In him was life** - Here "life" is a metaphor for causing everything to live. AT: "The one who is called the Word is the one who caused everything to live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **life** - Here use a general term for "life." If you must be more specific, translate as "spiritual life."
  * **that life was the light of all men** - "Light" is a metaphor that means God's revelation. AT: "he revealed to us the truth about God as a light reveals what is in the darkness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it** - Just as darkness cannot put out light, evil people have never prevented the one who is like a light from revealing God's truth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
