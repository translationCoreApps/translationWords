\v 30 How could one chase a thousand,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. He continues to quote Yahweh's words and tell them more of what they would have understood if they were wise ([[:en:bible:notes:deu:32:28|32:29]]). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **How could one chase a thousand ... unless ... had sold ... Yahweh had given them up?** - Moses uses a question to scold the people for not being wise enough to understand why their enemies are defeating them. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You would have realized why a thousand of your soldiers would be defeated by only one of the enemy soldiers ... because ... Yahweh had abandoned you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight** - You can make clear the understood information. AT: "1 enemy soldier can chase 1,000 of your men, and 2 enemy soldiers can cause 10,000 of your men to run away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **unless their Rock had sold them** - The word "Rock" refers to Yahweh who is strong and able to protect his people. AT: "unless Yahweh, their Rock, had handed them over"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their Rock ... our Rock** - "The Rock" a proper name that Moses gives to Yahweh, who, like a rock, is strong and able to protect his people. Translate "Rock" as in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:32:03|32:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **our enemies' rock is not like our Rock** - The enemies' idols and false gods are not powerful like Yahweh.
  * **Rock, just as even our enemies admit** - "Rock; not only do we say so, but our enemies say so also"
