===== translationNotes: =====

  * **make my heart rejoice** - Here the "heart" represents the person's feelings or emotions. AT: "make me feel joyful" or "make me glad" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **then I will give back an answer to the one who mocks me** - Here "answer" does not mean to answer a question. It means to respond or to reply to someone who is mocking. How this relates to the clause before it can be made clear. AT "then I will reply to the one who mocks me by telling him about you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **A prudent man sees trouble and hides himself, but the naive people go on and suffer because of it** - Translate this as you did a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:22:03|22:3]].
  * **A prudent man** - "A man who is wise" or "A man who has good sense" 
  * **the naive people** - "the inexperienced and immature people"
