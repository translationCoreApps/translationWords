===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh stands up to judge in court; he stands up to judge his people** - Isaiah speaks of Yahweh's decision to harm the people as if Yahweh were a judge in a court saying he will punish a criminal. AT: "It is as though Yahweh has taken his place in a courtroom and is ready to judge his people" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will pronounce judgment** - "will announce his judgment" or "will declare his judgment"
  * **on the officials** - "on the leaders" or "on the rulers"
  * **You have eaten up the vineyard** - Here "you" refers to the elders and rulers. Yahweh is comparing his people to a vineyard. Like someone who takes all the fruit from a vineyard, the elders and leaders are taking everything the people of Judah have. AT: "my people are like a vineyard and you have selfishly taken all of its fruit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the plunder from the poor** - "the things you have taken from those who are poor"
  * **Why do you crush my people and grind the faces of the poor?** - The Lord uses a question to scold the elders and leaders for being cruel to his people. AT: "I am angry with you evil men because you are crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **crush my people** - as a large stone crushes grain, a metaphor for cruelly harming them AT: "cruelly harm my people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **grind the faces** - as of one person rubbing the face of another person on the ground, a metaphor for harming poor people and taking away their dignity AT: "cruelly harm the poor and take away their dignity" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
