\v 17 Abraham prostrated himself with his face on the ground in respect before God. But then he laughed as he said to himself, "Can a man who is a hundred years old become a father of a son? And since Sarah is ninety years old, how can she bear a child?"
\v 18 Then Abraham said to God, "Perhaps you will let Ishmael receive your blessing \add and inherit all I possess\add*."

\v 17 Then Abraham bowed low with his face to the ground, and laughed, and said in his heart, "Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? How can Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a son?"
\v 18 Abraham said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before you!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **said in his heart** - "thought to himself" or "said to himself silently"
  * **Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old?** - Abraham used this rhetorical question because he did not believe that this could happen. AT: "Surely a man who is a hundred years old cannot father a child!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **How can Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a son?** - Again Abraham used a rhetorical question because he did not believe this could happen. The phrase "who is ninety years old" tells why Abraham did not believe that Sarah could bear a son. AT: "Sarah is ninety years old. Could she bear a son?" or "Sarah is ninety years old. Surely she could not bear a son!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and  [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])
  * **Oh that Ishmael might live before you** - "Please let Ishmael inherit the covenant that you have made with me" or "Perhaps Ishmael could receive your covenant blessing." Abraham suggested something that he believed really could happen.
