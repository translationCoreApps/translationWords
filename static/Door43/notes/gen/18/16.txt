\v 16 Then the men arose to leave and looked down toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way.
\v 17 But Yahweh said, "Should I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,
\v 18 since Abraham will indeed become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?
\v 19 For I have chosen him so that he may instruct his children and his household after him to keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice, so that Yahweh may bring upon Abraham what he has said to him."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to see them on their way** - "to send them on their way" or "to say 'Farewell' to them" (UDB). It was polite to go some distance with guests as they were leaving.
  * **Should I hide from Abraham what I am about to do ... him?** - God used this rhetorical question to say that he was going to talk to Abraham about something very important and that it was best for him to do so. AT: "I should not and will not hide from Abraham what I am about to do ... him." or "I should and will tell Abraham what I am about to do ... him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Should I ... do, since ... him?** - "I should not ... do. This is because ... him"
  * **all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will bless all the nations of the earth through Abraham" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **will be blessed in him** - "will be blessed because of Abraham" or "will be blessed because I have blessed Abraham." For translating "in him" see how you translated "through you" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:12:01|12:3]]. 
  * **that he may instruct** - "that he will direct" or "so that he will command"
  * **to keep the way of Yahweh ... Yahweh may bring ... he has said** - Yahweh is speaking about himself as if he were another person. AT: "to obey what I, Yahweh, require ... I, Yahweh, may bring ... I have said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **to keep the way of Yahweh** - "to obey the commands of Yahweh"
  * **to do righteousness and justice** - "by doing righteousness and justice." This tells how to keep the way of Yahweh. 
  * **so that Yahweh may bring upon Abraham what he has said to him** - "so that Yahweh may bless Abraham just as he said he would." This refers to the covenant promise to bless Abraham and make him a great nation.
