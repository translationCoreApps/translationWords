\v 17 Yahweh also said to me,
\v 18 "You human, your Israelite people \f + \ft metonymy \f* have become \add useless\add* to me. They are like \f + \ft metaphor \f* dross\f + \ft Or: slag \f* to me. They are like \f + \ft simile \f* the \add useless\add* copper, tin, iron, and lead that remains after silver is melted in a \add very hot\add* furnace
\v 19 Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: Because you have all become like dross\f + \ft Or: slag \f*, I will gather you in Jerusalem.

\v 17 Yahweh then said to me,
\v 18 "Son of man, your Israelite people have become useless to me. They are like dross to me. They are like the useless copper, tin, iron, and lead that remains after silver is melted in a very hot furnace
\v 19 Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: Because you have all become like dross, I will gather you in Jerusalem.

\v 17 Next the word of Yahweh came to me and said, 
\v 18 "Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me. All of them are the leftovers of bronze and tin, and iron and lead in your midst. They will be like the dross of silver in your furnace.
\v 19 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this, 'Because all of you have become like dross, therefore, behold! I am about to gather you into the center of Jerusalem.
