\v 18 It was actually three years after God revealed this good news to me that I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter. I stayed with him for fifteen days.
\v 19 I also saw James, the half-brother of our Lord Jesus and the leader of the believers in Jerusalem, but I did not see any other apostle.
\v 20 God knows that what I am writing to you is completely true!

\v 18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to get to know Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days.
\v 19 But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.
\v 20 Look, before God, I am not lying in what I write to you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I saw none of the other apostles except James** - This double negative emphasizes that James was the only apostle whom Paul saw. AT: "the only other apostle I saw was James" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **Look, before God** - Paul wants the Galatians to understand that Paul is completely serious and that he knows that God hears what he says and will judge him if he does not tell the truth.
  * **Look, before** - "Pay attention to the important words I am going to say to you: before" or "I want to assure you that before"
  * **I am not lying in what I write to you** - Paul uses litotes to emphasize that he is telling the truth. AT: "I am not lying to you in the messages I write to you" or "in the things I write to you I am telling you the truth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
