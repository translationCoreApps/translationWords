===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **so that the whole harvest is not confiscated by the holy place** - The words "holy place" is a metonym for the priests who work in the holy place. This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that the priests in Yahweh's holy place do not take away the whole harvest" or "so that you do not defile the whole harvest and the priests do not allow you to use it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **and the yield of the vineyard** - "and the fruit that grows in the vineyard"
  * **wool** - soft, curly hair that grows on a sheep
