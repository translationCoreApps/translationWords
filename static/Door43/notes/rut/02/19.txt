\v 19 Her mother-in-law asked her, "Where did you gather all this grain today? In whose field exactly did you work? May God do good to the man who was so kind to you." Then Ruth told her about where she had been working. She said, "The name of that field's owner is Boaz."
\v 20 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "May Yahweh bless him! He has not stopped acting kindly toward us, who are still living, and to our husbands who have died." Then she added, "That man is a close relative of Elimelech; in fact, he is one of those responsible for taking care of us."

\v 19 Her mother-in-law said to her, "Where have you gleaned today? Where did you go to work? May the man who helped you be blessed."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Where have you gleaned today? Where did you go to work?** - Naomi said almost the same thing in two different ways to show that she was very interested in knowing what had happened to Ruth that day. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **he be blessed by Yahweh** - Naomi is asking God to reward Boaz for his kindness to Ruth and herself.
  * **who has not left off his loyalty** - "who has continued to be loyal." Possible meanings are 1) Boaz remembered his obligations to Naomi as a family member or 2)  Naomi is referring to Yahweh, who was acting through Boaz or 3) Yahweh has continued to be faithful to the living and the dead. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **to the living** - "to the people who are still living." Naomi and Ruth were the "living." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the dead** - "the people who have already died." Naomi's husband and sons were the "dead." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **near of kin to us, one of our kinsman-redeemers** - The second phrase repeats and expands the first. This is a Hebrew style of emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **kinsman-redeemers** - A kinsman-redeemer was a close male relative who could rescue a childless widow from financial ruin by marrying her and having a child with her. He would also reacquire the land his relatives had lost due to poverty and redeem family members who had sold themselves into slavery. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
