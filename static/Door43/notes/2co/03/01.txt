\v 1 \add As I write these things about myself\add*, I am \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* not \add doing it\add* to boast about how good I am, \add as some of you say I do\add*. Some people always carry letters with them that tell how well they work, \add that other people\add* have \add written\add*. But I do not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* need \add to bring\add* letters like that \add when I come to you\add*. Nor do I need to ask you \add to write\add* letters like that \add for me when I go to other congregations\add*.
\v 2 You yourselves are \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like a\add* letter that recommends my work \add for God to everyone\add*. People see \add how Christ changed\add* your \add lives when you believed the message that I taught you\add*. Everyone \add who knows you\add* can see \add the result of my work for God\add*.
\v 3 You are \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like\add* a letter that Christ himself \add has written\add* that says good things about \add my work for God in your lives\add*. You show \add people by the way you now conduct your lives that God has changed your lives\add* as a result of my work \add among you. People did\add* not \add find out about you by\add* reading \add a letter that was written to them on paper\add* with \add pen and\add* ink. Instead, \add they saw how\add* the Spirit of the all-powerful God \add has changed your lives\add*. Nor \add did people find out about you by reading\add* a letter that was carved on stone slabs \add like the stone slabs that God gave to Moses\add*. Instead, \add it was the change that God's Spirit made in\add* your lives \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that they saw\add*.

\v 1 You know us well, and you should trust us. A stranger might need someone you know to write you a letter to introduce him to you, but you know us very well.
\v 2 You yourselves are like a letter that introduces us to other people, because everyone who knows you can see how much you trust us.
\v 3 The way you live is like a letter that Christ himself has written and that we brought to you. Of course, it is not a letter written with ink or on stone tablets. No, it is a letter that the Spirit of the true God has written on your own hearts.

\p
\v 1 Are we beginning to praise ourselves again? We do not need letters of recommendation to you or from you, like some people, do we?
\v 2 You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, known and read by all people.
\v 3 And you show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us. It was written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God. It was not written on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.

  * **We do not need letters of recommendation to you or from you, like some people, do we?** - Paul says this to express that the Corinthians already know about Paul and Timothy's good reputation.

  * **letters of recommendation** - This is a letter that a person writes to introduce and give their approval of someone else.

  * **It was written not with ink ... on tablets of human hearts** - Paul clarifies that the Corinthians are like a spiritual letter, not like a letter that humans write with physical objects.
  * **It was written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "It is not a letter that people wrote with ink but a letter that the Spirit of the living God wrote" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **It was not written on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts** - This can be stated in active form.

  * **tablets of human hearts** - Paul speaks of their hearts as if they are flat pieces of stone or clay upon which people engraved letters. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
