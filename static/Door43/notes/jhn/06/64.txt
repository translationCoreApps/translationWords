\v 64 Yet there are some of you who do not trust what I am teaching you." Jesus said this because he knew from the start of his work who it was who would not trust in him, and he knew the person who would betray him.

\v 65 Then he said, "That is why I told you that no one can come to me and to live forever unless the Father makes him able to come to me."
