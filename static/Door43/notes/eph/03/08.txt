===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Although I am the least  \add worthy\add* of all God's people, God kindly  \add appointed\add* me to proclaim to the non-Jews the message about the great spiritual blessings that  \add they can receive\add* from Christ,
\v 9 and to enable everyone to understand clearly how God accomplished what he planned. God, who created everything, \add has now revealed\add* this message, which he never revealed to anyone before.

<usfm>
\v 8 Although I am the least worthy of all God's people, God has enabled me by his kindness and mercy to proclaim to non-Jews the good news about what Christ has done for us, which is so much that no one can learn all about it.
\v 9 My mission is to explain to everyone what God's plan is, something that God has kept hidden from long ago, from the time when he created everything.

<usfm>
\v 8 God gave this gift to me, although I am the smallest of those set apart for God. This gift is that I should proclaim to the Gentiles the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ.
\v 9 I should enlighten all people about what is God's secret plan. This is the plan that had been hidden for ages in the past by God, who created all things.
</usfm>
