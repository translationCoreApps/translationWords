\v 23 Only the descendants of Levi are permitted to work at the Sacred Tent, and they will be punished if anything bad happens to it. That is a law that will never be changed. You descendants of Levi will not receive any land among the other Israelite people,
\v 24 because I will give you one tenth of all the \add crops and animals\add* that the Israelites bring to be offerings to me. That is why I said that you will not receive any land like the other Israelites will receive."

\v 24 The Israelites must present one tenth of all their crops and animals as offerings to me, and that is what I give to the descendents of Levi so they can provide for themselves. This is why I said that I will not give the descendants of Levi any land to own.

\v 23 The Levites must do the work connected to the tent of meeting. They will be responsible for any sin regarding it. This will be a permanent law throughout your people's generations. Among the people of Israel they must have no inheritance.
\v 24 For the tithes of the people of Israel, which they offer as a contribution to meâ€”it is these that I have given to the Levites as their inheritance. That is why I said to them, 'They must have no inheritance among the people of Israel.'"
