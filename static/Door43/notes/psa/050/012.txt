===== translationNotes: =====

  * **If I were hungry** - This describes something that could not happen, since God does not get hungry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **Will I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?** - God asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that he does not do these things and so has no need for their sacrifices. AT: "I do not eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
