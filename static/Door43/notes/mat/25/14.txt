\v 14 For it is like when a man was about to go into another country. He called his own servants and gave over to them his wealth.
\v 15 To one of them he gave five talents, to another he gave two, and to yet another he gave one talent. Each one received an amount according to his own ability, and that man went on his journey.
\v 16 The one who received the five talents went and invested them, and made another five talents.
