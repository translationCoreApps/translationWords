\v 14 Now, because we are loyal to you, and because we do not want you to be humiliated, we are sending this information to you.
\v 15 And, we suggest that you order your officials to search among the records kept by your ancestors. If you do that, you will find out that the people in this city have always rebelled against the
government. You will also find out that from long ago these people caused trouble for kings and for rulers of provinces. They have always revolted against those who ruled them. That is the
reason that this city was destroyed by the Babylonian army.
\v 16 We want you to know that if they rebuild this city and finish building its walls, you will no longer be able to control the people in this province west of the Euphrates River."

<usfm>
\v 14 Surely because we have eaten the palace salt, it is not fitting for us to see any dishonor happen to the king. It is because of this that we are informing the king
\v 15 to search your father's record and to verify that this is a rebellious city that will harm kings and provinces. It has caused many problems to the kings and provinces. It has been a center for rebellion from long ago. It was for this reason that the city was destroyed.
\v 16 We are informing the king that if this city and wall are built, then there will be nothing remaining for you in the Province Beyond the River."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **we have eaten the palace salt** - Possible meanings are that this refers to 1) the writers being loyal to the king (UDB) or 2) the king giving the writers special honors. AT: "we are loyal to you" or "you have honored us by making us your officials" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a rebellious city** - The city is a metonym for the people who live in it. AT: "a city in which live people who have rebelled against your father" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the city was destroyed** - This can be translated in active form, in which case you will need to make explicit who destroyed the city. AT: "the Babylonians destroyed the city" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **if this city and wall are built** - This can be translated in active form. Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:ezr:04:13|4:13]]. AT: "if they build the city and wall" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **there will be nothing remaining for you** - This is an exaggeration to make the king think that he will be losing much tax money if the Judeans rebel. (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **the Province Beyond the River** - This is the name of the province that was west of the Euphrates River. It was across the river from the city of Susa. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezr:04:09|4:10]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
