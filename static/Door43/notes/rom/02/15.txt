<usfm>
\v 15 They show that they know in their own minds what God commands in his law, for each person in his very own conscience either accuses himself of bad behavior or defends himself.
\v 16 God will punish them at the time when he will judge people according to what they have thought and done secretly. He will judge people by authorizing Christ Jesus to judge them. This is what I tell people when I preach the good news to them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 By this they show that the actions required by the law are written in their hearts. Their conscience also bears witness to them, and their own thoughts either accuse or defend them to themselves
\v 16 and also to God. That will happen on the day when God will judge the secrets of all people, according to my gospel, through Jesus Christ.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **By this they show** - "By naturally obeying the law they show"
  * **the actions required by the law are written in their hearts** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God has written on their hearts what the law requires them to do" or "God has shown them what the law requires" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **bears witness to them, and their own thoughts either accuse or defend them to themselves** - Here "bears witness" refers to the knowledge they gain from the law that God has written in their hearts. AT: "tells them if they are disobeying or obeying God's law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **on the day when God will judge** - This finishes Paul's thought from [[:en:bible:notes:rom:02:13|2:13]]. "This will happen when God judges"
