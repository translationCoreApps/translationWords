\v 34 When they stumble, they will receive a little help, and many will join them who do not mean what they say. 
\v 35 Some of the wise will stumble so that they may be refined, cleansed, and made pure until the time of the end. For the appointed time is still to come.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **will give understanding to many** - "will help many people understand" 
  * **they will fall by the sword** - The word "sword" here is used to refer to battles. AT: "they will be killed in battle." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **they will fall ... When they stumble ... the wise will stumble** - The same word is translated as "fall" and "stumble." It means to suffer severely or to die. It does not imply that they sinned. If your language has a single term with the same meaning, you may want to use it here.
  * **they will be taken as prisoners and robbed of their possessions** - "their enemies will put them in prison and steal their possessions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Some of the wise will stumble ... until the time of the end** - This persecution will continue until the time when God has decided that it will end. It does not mean that the wise are only cleansed and purified until then.
  * **that they may be refined, cleansed, and made pure** - "that God may refine them, cleanse them, and make them pure" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **refined** - this refers to the purifying of metal by melting it in a fire
  * **time of the end** - "the final days" or "the end of the world." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:08:15|8:17]].
  * **the appointed time is still to come** - "it is not yet time for the end to happen." Here "appointed" implies that God has set the time. AT: "Yahweh has decided to end the persecution at a time that will come later"
