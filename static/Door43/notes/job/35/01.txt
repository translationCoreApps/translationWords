===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do you think this is just ... 'My right before God'?** - Elihu uses questions to challenge Job. AT: "You must think you are right ... 'My right before God.'" or "It is not just ... 'My right before God.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do you think this is just when you say** - "Do you think it is right for you to say"
  * **Do you think** - Here "you" is singular and refers to Job. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **My right before God** - Possible meanings are 1) Job is claiming to be innocent before God or 2) Job is claiming that he, rather than God, is right.
  * **For you ask, 'What use is it to me?' and, 'Would I be better off if I had sinned?'** - Elihu quotes Job as saying the these two rhetorical questions. AT: "For you say, 'It does not benefit me' and, 'I am no better off than if I had sinned.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
