  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking about the people of Judah.

  * **Turn aside from the way, stray off the path** - How Yahweh wants his people to behave is spoken of as if it were a way or path on which to walk. To disobey Yahweh is spoken of as if the person strays away from Yahweh's path. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Holy One of Israel** - Translate this the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:04|1:4]].
