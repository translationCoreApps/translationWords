====== Philippians 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Philippians 3:4-8 contains a list of Paul's "qualifications" for being considered a righteous Jew. In every conceivable way, Paul was an exemplary Jew. He uses this to contrast with the greatness of knowing Jesus. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Dogs ==
In the ancient Near East, dogs were used as an image to refer to people in a negative way. Not all cultures will use the term "dogs" in this way and some cultures may have positive connotations associated with dogs. 

== Resurrected Bodies ==
Very little is known about what people will look like in heaven. It is apparent from this chapter, people will have bodies and they will be free from sin. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:heaven]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Prize ==
Paul uses an extended illustration to describe the Christian life. The goal of the Christian life is attempting to grow in likeness to Christ until a person dies. This goal can never be perfectly achieved but must be strived for.
