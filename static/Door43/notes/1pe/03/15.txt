<usfm>
\v 15 Instead, acknowledge in your inner beings that Christ is your master, whom you love. Always be ready to answer anyone who demands that you tell them about what you are confidently expecting God to do for you. But answer them humbly and respectfully,
\v 16 and make sure that you do nothing wrong, in order that those who speak evil about you may be ashamed when they see the good way in which you are conducting yourselves because you are joined to Christ.
\v 17 It may be that God wants you to suffer. If so, it is better to do good deeds, even if you suffer for doing them, than to do evil deeds.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Instead, set apart the Lord Christ in your hearts as holy. Always be ready to answer everyone who asks you why you have confidence in God. Do this with meekness and respect.
\v 16 Have a good conscience so that the people who insult your good life in Christ may be ashamed because they are speaking against you as if you were evildoers. 
\v 17 It is better, if God desires, that you suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
