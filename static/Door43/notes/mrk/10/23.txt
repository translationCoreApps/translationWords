\v 23 Jesus looked around \add at the people\add*. Then he exclaimed to his disciples, "It is very difficult for people who are wealthy to\add decide to\add* let God rule their lives!"
\v 24 The disciples were surprised at what he said. \add They thought that God favored the rich people, so if God did not save them, he would not save anyone\add*. So Jesus replied again to them, "My dear friends, it is very difficult for anyone \add to decide\add* to let God rule his life.
\v 25 It is impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. It is almost as difficult \f + \ft hyperbole \f* for rich people \add to decide\add* to let God rule their \add lives\add*."

\v 23 Jesus looked around at the people. Then he exclaimed to his disciples, "It is very difficult for people who are wealthy to agree for God to rule over them."
\v 24 The disciples were confused by what he said. Jesus said again, "My dear friends, it is very difficult for anyone to agree for God to rule over them.
\v 25 In fact, it would be easier for a very large animal like a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for rich people to accept God to rule over them."

\v 25 It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."
