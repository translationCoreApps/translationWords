<usfm>
\v 6 After they have arranged all these things in this way, the Jewish priests habitually go into the outer room of the tent to do their tasks.
\v 7 But into the inner room only the high priest goes once a year. He always takes the blood of animals that they have slaughtered. He offers the blood to God for his own sins and for the sins that the other Israelites have committed. This includes the sins they committed but they did not know they were committing sins.

===== ULB: =====

\v 6 After these things were prepared, the priests always entered the outer room of the tabernacle to perform their services.
\v 7 But only the high priest entered the second room once each year, and not without blood that he offered for himself and for the people's unintentional sins.
