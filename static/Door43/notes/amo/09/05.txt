\q
\v 5 The Lord, Yahweh of hosts
\q touches the land and it melts;
\q all who live in it mourn;
\q all of it will rise up like the River,
\q and sink again like the river of Egypt.

\v 6 It is he who builds his steps in the heavens,
\q and has established his vault over the earth.
\q He calls for the waters of the sea,
\q and pours them out on the surface of the earth,
\q Yahweh is his name.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he who builds his steps in the heavens** - These are probably the steps that ancient people imagined led up to God's palace in the heavens. However, some modern versions wish to read a different Hebrew word meaning "palace" or "rooms." Here "his steps" probably serves as metonymy for God's palace. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **has established his vault over the earth** - Some versions translate "has established his supports on the earth," that is, the structures that on which the earth rests.
