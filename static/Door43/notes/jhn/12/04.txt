\v 4 But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, \f + \ft Or: Judas, the man from Kerioth village \f* objected. He was the one who later enabled Jesus' enemies to seize him.
\v 5 He said, "We should have sold this perfume and given \add the money\add* to poor people!\f + \ft Or: Why did \add we\add* not sell this perfume and give \add the money for it\add* to the poor people? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* We could have gotten three hundred days' wages for it!"
\v 6 He said that, not because he cared about the poor people, but instead, because he was a thief. He was the one who kept the bag \add of funds that people gave to help Jesus and us his disciples\add*, and he often stole some of the money that was \f + \ft Or:that \add people\add* \f* put into it.

\v 4 However, one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, (he was the one who broke the trust Jesus had in him, and soon he would give Jesus up to his enemies)â€”he objected and said,
\v 5 "We should have sold this perfume for three hundred days' wages and given the money to the poor."
\v 6 He said this, not because he cared about the poor people, but because he was a thief. He kept charge of the bag that held their money, but he would take money for his own use whenever he wanted.

\v 4 Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one who would betray him, said,
\v 5 "Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"
\v 6 Now he said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief: he had the moneybag and would steal from what was put in it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the one who would betray him** - "the one who later enabled Jesus' enemies to seize him"
  * **Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?** - This is a rhetorical question. You can translate it as a strong statement. AT: "This perfume could have been sold for three hundred denarii and the money could have been given to the poor!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **three hundred denarii** - You can translate this as a numeral. AT: "300 denarii" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **denarii** - A denarius was the amount of silver that a common laborer could earn in one day of work. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]])
  * **Now he said this ... would steal from what was put in it** - John explains why Judas asked the question about the poor. If your language has a way of indicating background information, you can use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **he said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief** - "he said this because he was a thief. He did not care about the poor"
