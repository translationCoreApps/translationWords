\v 10 We are your servants. We are the people whom you brought back here by your very great power \f + \ft metonymy, doublet \f* \add from being exiled in Babylonia\add*.
\v 11 Yahweh, please hear this prayer of mine, and the prayers of all your people who are delighted to revere you \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

\v 10 We are your servants. We are the people whom you have delivered from slavery by your very great power. You did that because you are able to do whatever you desire.
\v 11 Yahweh, please hear my prayer, I who am your servant. Please hear the prayers of all your people who have great joy when they honor you for who you are and what you do. Now I pray you would give me success when I go to the king; and protect me as I make a request of the king that could put my life in jeopardy. Give me mercy."
\p I was serving as one of the most trusted servants to the king.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Nehemiah continues his prayer.

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in Nehemiah's prayer. Here he begins to make his request based on Yahweh's promise.
  * **they are your servants** - The word "they" refers to the Israelite people. 
  * **by your great power and by your strong hand** - Here "hand" represents strength or power. Together, these two phrases form a doublet that emphasizes the intensity of Yahweh's power. AT: "by your great power and by your mighty strength" or "by your very powerful strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the prayer of your servant** - Here "servant" refers to Nehemiah. This is how a person would address his superior in order to show humility and respect. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:neh:01:06|1:6]].
  * **the prayer of your servants** - Here "servants" refers to the rest of the Israelite people who would have been praying for Yahweh to act on behalf of his people and on behalf of Jerusalem.
  * **who delight to honor your name** - Here "name" represents Yahweh himself. AT: "who delight to honor you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **grant him mercy in the sight of this man** - Here "him" refers to Nehemiah, who refers to himself in the third person to express his humility before God, and "this man" refers to Artaxerxes, the king of Persia. 
  * **in the sight of this man** - Nehemiah speaks of the king's attitude or disposition as if it were how the king viewed something. AT: "grant that the king will have mercy on me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I served as cupbearer to the king** - This is background information about Nehemiah's role in the king's court. Your language may have a special way to mark background information. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
