<usfm>
\v 12 Then all the people of Judah again started to bring to the temple storerooms their tithes of grain, wine, and \add olive\add* oil.
\v 13 I appointed these men to be in charge of the storerooms: Shelemiah, who was a priest; Zadok, who knew the Jewish laws very well; and Pedaiah, a descendant of Levi. I appointed Hanan, who is the son of Zaccur and grandson of Mattaniah, to assist them. I knew that I could trust these men while they distributed those offerings to their fellow workers.
\p
\v 14 My God, do not forget all these good deeds that I have faithfully done for your temple and for the work that is done there!

\v 12 Then all Judah brought in the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the oil to the storerooms.
\v 13 I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and from the Levites, Pedaiah. Next to them was Hanan son of Zaccur son of Mattaniah, for they were counted as trustworthy. Their duties were to distribute the supplies to their associates.
\v 14 Call me to mind, my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out the good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and its services.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **all Judah** - The name of the land is a metonym for the people of the land. This is probably a generalization. AT: "all the people who lived in Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Shelemiah ... Zadok ... Pedaiah ... Hanan ... Zaccur ... Mattaniah** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **they were counted as trustworthy** - This can be translated in active form. The abstract noun "trustworthy" can be translated as a verb. AT: "I knew that I could trust them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Call me to mind, my God, concerning this** - "My God, remember me concerning this"
