\q
\v 4 Yet their words go out over all the earth,
\q and their speech to the end of the world.
\q He has pitched a tent for the sun among them.
\q
\v 5 The sun is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber
\q and like a strong man who rejoices when he runs his race.
\q
\v 6 The sun rises from the one horizon
\q and crosses the sky to the other;
\q nothing escapes its heat.
