\v 6 I have not lived in any building from the day that I brought the Israelites up from Egypt until now. Instead, I have been living in my sacred tent, moving from one place to another with the people.

<usfm>
\v 6 For I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up the people of Israel out of Egypt until this present day; instead, I have been moving about in a tent, a tabernacle.
\v 7 In all places where I have moved among all the people of Israel, did I ever say anything to any of Israel's leaders whom I appointed to shepherd my people Israel, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'"

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **did I ever say anything to any of Israel's leaders whom I appointed to shepherd my people Israel, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"** - This has a quotation within a quotation. The direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "I have never asked any of the leaders, whom I appointed, to build me a temple of cedar wood." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **did I ever say anything to any of Israel's leaders** - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that he never asked any of Israel's leaders to build him a house. AT: "I never said anything to any of Israel's leaders" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Why have you not built me a house of cedar?** - If Yahweh had asked the leaders this question, he would have been using a question to scold them for not building him a house of cedar. But, Yahweh said previously that he did not ask them this question. AT: "You should have built me a house of cedar." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **whom I appointed to shepherd my people Israel** - Those who are leaders of the people of Israel are spoken of as if they were shepherds and the people were sheep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
