\v 7 Similarly, the people who lived in Sodom and Gomorrah cities and the nearby cities committed sexual immorality. They sought all kinds of sexual relations that differ from what God permits. So God destroyed their cities. What happened to those people and those angels in heaven shows that God will punish people, such as the ones who teach false doctrine, in the eternal fire of hell.
\v 8 Similarly, these people in your midst also defile their own bodies by living immorally. They say that God has sent them visions that tell them to do this. But they do not obey God's commands, and they insult his wonderful angels.

\v 7 It is just like Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, which also indulged themselves in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desires. They were displayed as examples of those who suffer the punishment in eternal fire.
\v 8 Yet in the same way, these dreamers also pollute their bodies. They reject authority, and they say slanderous things against the glorious ones.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **also indulged themselves** - The sexual sins of Sodom and Gomorrah were the result of the same kind of rebellion as the angels' evil ways.
  * **indulged themselves** - Here "cities" stands for the people who lived in them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **They were displayed** - It is implied that God displayed them as examples.  At: "God showed them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **as examples of those who suffer the punishment** - The destruction of the people of Sodom and Gomorrah became an example for the fate of all who reject God.
  * **these dreamers** - the people who disobey God, probably because they claimed to see visions that gave them authority to do so
  * **pollute their bodies** - This metaphor says that their sin makes their bodies—that is, their actions—unacceptable the way garbage in a stream makes the water undrinkable. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **say slanderous things** - "speak insults"
  * **glorious ones** - This refers to spiritual beings, such as angels.
