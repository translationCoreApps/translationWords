\v 19 You shall not lift your eyes up to the heavens and look at the sun, the moon, or the stars—all the host of the heavens—and be drawn away to worship them and adore them—those things of which Yahweh your God has given a share all the peoples under the whole sky.
\v 20 But Yahweh has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of his own inheritance, as you are today.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **You shall not lift your eyes ... and look ... and be drawn ... Yahweh your God** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" and the words "lift," "look," and "be drawn" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **You shall not ... and be drawn away to worship** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Do not ... and do not let anyone make you want to worship" or "Do not ... and do not allow yourself worship" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **all the host of the heavens** - "everything you can see in the sky." This is another way of referring to the sun, moon, and stars.
  * **of which Yahweh your God has given a share all the peoples** - This is an idiom. Moses speaks of the stars as if they were small objects like food that Yahweh was dividing and giving out to the people groups. AT: "that Yahweh your God has put there to help all people groups" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **brought you out of the iron furnace** - Moses speaks of Egypt and the hard work the Israelites did there as if it were an oven in which iron is heated and the Israelites were the iron. AT: "brought you out of the land where people made you do hard work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a people of his own inheritance** - This is an idiom that can be translated "people who belong only to him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
