===== translationNotes: =====

  * **And it is undeniable** - "And no one can deny"

  * **He appeared ... up in glory** - This is most likely a song or poem that Paul is quoting. If your language has a way of indicating that this is poetry you could use it here. If not, you could translate this as regular prose rather than poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]])
  * **He appeared** - Here "He" is ambiguous. It could refers to "God" or to "Christ." It may be best to translate this as "He." If you must be more specific you could translate it as "Christ who is God" or "Christ."
