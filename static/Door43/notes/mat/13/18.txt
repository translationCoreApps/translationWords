\v 18 Now listen to me explain the parable I told you.
\v 19 Some people hear about how God is ruling but do not understand it. They are like the path where some of the seeds fell. Satan, the evil one, comes and causes these people to forget what they have heard.

\v 18 Listen then to the parable of the farmer who sowed his seed.
\v 19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is the seed that was sown beside the road.
