===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Only do not** - "Do not." The word "only" is used here to emphasize what he did not want the Levite to do.
  * **square** - This refers to the city square. Translate this the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:19:16|19:17]].
  * **brought the Levite into his house** - This means that he invited the Levite to spend the night in his house. Also, by inviting the Levite he was inviting the man's concubine and servant as well. AT: "invited the Levite and his servants to stay in his house" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
