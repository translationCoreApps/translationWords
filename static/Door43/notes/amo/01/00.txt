====== Amos 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This book is written in a poetic form. Because it was written by a farmer, it includes many references to agricultural concepts. 

== "For three sins of Judah, even for four" ==
The phrase ""For three sins of Judah, even for four," is used to begin each oracle. This is not intended to be a literal count but is an idiom showing a large number of sins. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])
