\v 30 Then they tried to lay their hands on him, but no one could arrest him because it was not yet the time for him to complete his work and for his life to end.
\v 31 Many in the crowd, after they heard him and saw his works, put their trust in him. They said, "When the Messiah comes, will he be able to do more miraculous signs than this man has done?"
\v 32 The Pharisees heard them quietly speaking these things about Jesus. So they, the chief priests and Pharisees together sent some officers to arrest him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **his hour had not yet come** - The word "hour" is a metonym that represents the right time for Jesus to be arrested, according to God's plan. AT: "it was not the right time to arrest him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than what this one has done?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "When the Christ comes, surely he will not be able to do more signs than this man has done!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **signs** - This refers to the miracles that prove that Jesus is the Christ.
