\v 11 Since that time is near, if those who act in an evil manner want to continue to act that way, let them continue to do so. God will soon pay them back for that. If those who are vile want to continue to be vile, let them continue to do so. God will soon pay them back for that. Those who are acting righteously should continue to act righteously. Those who are perfect should continue to be perfect."

\v 10 He said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.
\v 11 The one who is unrighteous, let him continue to do unrighteousness. The one who is morally filthy, let him continue to be morally filthy. The one who is righteous, let him continue to do what is righteous. The one who is holy, let him continue to be holy."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The angel finishes speaking to John.

  * **Do not seal up ... this book** - To seal a book was to keep it closed with something that makes it impossible for anyone to read what was inside without breaking the seal. The angel is telling John not to keep the message a secret. AT: "Do not keep secret ... this book" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the words of the prophecy of this book** - Here "words" refers to the message that they formed. AT: "This prophetic message of this book." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:22:06|22:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
