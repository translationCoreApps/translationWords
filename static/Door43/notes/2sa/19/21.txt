\v 21 But Abishai son of Zeruiah answered and said, "Should not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh's anointed?"
\v 22 Then David said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should today be adversaries to me? Will any man be put to death today in Israel? For do I not know that today I am king over Israel?"
\v 23 So the king said to Shimei, "You will not die." So the king promised him with an oath.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Abishai ... Zeruiah ... Shimei** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Should not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh's anointed?** - Zeruiah was angry at Shimei for cursing David and thought he should be killed. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Shimei should be put to death because he cursed David, the anointed king of the nation of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Yahweh's anointed** - This metonym refers to David, the man whom Yahweh anointed as king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should today be adversaries to me? Will any man be put to death today in Israel? For do I not know that today I am king over Israel?** - These three rhetorical questions show David's anger with the sons of Zeruiah.  These questions can be translated as statements. AT: "We have nothing in common with you, you sons of Zeruiah! You have no good reason to become my adversaries today. No person will be executed today in the nation of Israel, because today I am the one who is king over all of Israel."
  * **For do I not know that today I am king over Israel?** - Possible meanings are 1) "I know that I am still king of Israel." (UDB) or 2) "Today I am the one who is king over Israel!"
