  * **General Information:** - Verse 29 is a summary of this chapter.

  * **God called Abraham to mind** - This tells why God rescued Lot. To "call to mind" is a way of saying "remember." This does not imply that God forgot about Abraham. It means he considered Abraham and had mercy on him. AT: "God thought about Abraham and had mercy on him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **out of the midst of the destruction** - "away from the destruction" or "away from danger"
