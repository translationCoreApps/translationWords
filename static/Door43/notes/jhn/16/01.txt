===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The part of the story from the previous chapter continues. Jesus reclines at the table with his disciples and continues to speak to them.

  * **you will not fall away** - Here the phrase "fall away" implies to stop putting one's trust in Jesus. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "so that you would not stop trusting in me because of the difficulties you must face." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **the hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think that he is offering a service to God** - "it will someday happen that a person will kill you and think he is doing something good for God."
