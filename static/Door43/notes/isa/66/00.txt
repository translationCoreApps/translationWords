====== Isaiah 66 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 66:1-17, 21-24, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== In the end ==
In the end, Yahweh will enact his perfect justice. This is the true hope of this world. The new heaven and the new earth are an important part of this. In the end, this will be the perfect creation of Yahweh and will last forever. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:justice]], [[:en:obe:kt:hope]] and [[:en:obe:kt:forever]])
