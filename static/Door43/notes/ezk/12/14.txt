\v 15 Then, when I scatter them among many nations, they will know that I, Yahweh have the power to do what I say that I will do.
\v 16 But I will spare some of them from being killed by the sword, or starving to death, or dying of disease so they can record that they have been doing disgusting things, and they will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do."

\v 14 I will also scatter in every direction all of those around him who were to assist him and his entire army, and I will send out a sword after them.
\v 15 Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the lands.
\v 16 But I will spare a few men from among them from the sword, famine, and plague, so they may record all of their abominations in the lands where I take them, so they will know that I am Yahweh.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will send out a sword after them** - The word "sword" is a metonym for enemy armies who will attack with their swords. AT: "I will send armies to pursue them with swords" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **know that I am Yahweh** - When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]]. AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the lands** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. AT: "when I cause them to separate from each other and live in different nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **from the sword** - The word "sword" is a metonym for enemy armies who will attack with their swords. It is implied that Yahweh will spare them from dying in battle. AT: "from dying in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
