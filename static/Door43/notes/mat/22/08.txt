\v 8 Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.
\v 9 Therefore go to the highway crossings and invite as many people to the marriage feast as you can find.'
\v 10 The servants went out to the highways and gathered together all the people they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.
