===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Verse 16 states a general principle, and verse 17 gives one specific example. The idea of eating too much honey and then vomiting it up is a metaphor for taking too much of any good thing and regretting it later. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
