===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to him** - This refers to the man that Jesus just healed.
  * **say nothing to any man** - "do not say anything to anyone" or "do not tell anyone I healed you"
  * **show yourself to the priest** - Jewish law required that the person show his healed skin to the priest, who would then allow him or her to return to the community, to be with other people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them** - The law of Moses required that someone healed of leprosy give a thanksgiving offering to the priest. When the priest accepted the gift, people would know that the man had been healed. Lepers were ostracized, banned from the community, until they had proof of their healing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **to them** - This can possibly refer to 1) the priests or 2) all the people or 3) the critics of Jesus. If possible, use a pronoun that could refer to any of these groups. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
