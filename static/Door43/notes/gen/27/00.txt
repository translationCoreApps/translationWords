== Blessing ==
In the ancient Near East, a father's blessing was very important. This spoken blessing was legally binding. Jacob previously receive the birthright from Esau and was guaranteed the double portion of land and money that was supposed to be inherited by the older son, Esau. In this chapter, Jacob tricks Isaac into giving him Isaac blessing. This means that he is to inherit the promises of the covenant Yahweh made with Abraham. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:bless]], [[:en:obe:kt:birthright]], [[:en:obe:kt:inherit]], [[:en:obe:kt:promise]] and [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]])
