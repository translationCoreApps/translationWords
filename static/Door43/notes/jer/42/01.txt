  * **Jezaniah ... Hoshaiah** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **all the people from the least to the greatest** - This is a way to refer to people from every social status. Here "least" and "greatest" represent those who are least important and those who are most important. AT: "all the people from every social status" or "all the people, including the least important and the most important people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
