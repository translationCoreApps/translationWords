\v 43 If mildew comes again and breaks out in the house in which the stones have been taken away and the walls have been scraped and then replastered,
\v 44 then the priest must come in and examine the house to see if mildew has spread in the house. If it has, then it is harmful mildew, and the house is unclean.
