\v 20 But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish along with you, because you thought to obtain the gift of God with money.
\v 21 You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart is not right with God.
\v 22 Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord, so that he might perhaps forgive you for the intention of your heart.
\v 23 For I see that you are in the poison of bitterness and in the bonds of sin."
