\v 1 After this I saw another angel, one who had great authority, coming down from heaven. The earth became bright because he was shining so intensely.
\v 2 He shouted with a very loud voice, "God is about to completely destroy the very evil city of Babylon. As a result, all kinds of evil spirits will live there, and all kinds of foul and detestable birds will live there. Babylon is like a prostitute
\v 3 with whom all the people groups engaged with her in the passion of sexual immorality, which is like getting drunk on too much wine. Yes, and the kings of the earth have done the same things with her. The world's merchants became rich because she wanted to commit so much sexual immorality."

\c 18
\p
\v 1 After these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illumined by his glory.
\v 2 He cried out with a mighty voice, saying,
\q "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!
\q2 She has become a dwelling place for demons,
\q a refuge for every unclean spirit,
\q2 and a refuge for every unclean and detestable bird.
\q
\v 3 For all the nations have drunk the wine of her immoral passion.
\q2 The kings of the earth have committed immorality with her.
\q The merchants of the earth have become rich from the power of her sensual way of living."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Another angel comes down from heaven and speaks. This is a different angel than the one in the previous chapter, who spoke about the prostitute and the beast.

  * **General Information:** - The pronouns "she" and "her" refer to the city of Babylon, which is spoken of as if it were a prostitute. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])

  * **Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great** - The angel speaks of Babylon being destroyed as if it had fallen. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:14:08]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **detestable bird** - "disgusting bird" or "repulsive bird"
  * **all the nations** - The nations is a metonym for the people of those nations.  AT: "the people of all the nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **have drunk the wine of her immoral passion** - This is a symbol for participating in her sexually immoral passion.  AT: "have become sexually immoral like her" or "have become drunk like her in sexual sin"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **her immoral passion** - Babylon is spoken of as if it were a prostitute who has caused other people to sin along with her. This may well have a double meaning: literal sexual immorality and also the worship of false gods. (See:  [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **merchants** - A merchant is a person who sells things.
  * **from the power of her sensual way of living** - "because she spent so much money on sexual immorality"
