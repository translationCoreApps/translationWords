\v 19 All the holy offerings that the people of Israel present to Yahweh, I have given to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as a continual share. It is an everlasting covenant of salt, a binding covenant forever, before Yahweh for both you and your descendants with you."
\v 20 Yahweh said to Aaron, "You will have no inheritance in the people's land, nor will you have any share of property among the people. I am your share and inheritance among the people of Israel.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - God continues speaking to Aaron.

  * **I have given to you** - God speaks as if he had already done this because it is a decision that he had already made. AT: "I give to you"
  * **as a continual share** - A share is a portion of something that someone receives. AT: "as the portion that you will continually receive"
  * **an everlasting covenant of salt ... a binding covenant forever** - The two phrases refer to the same thing. Together they emphasize that the covenant will endure forever. AT: "an agreement forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **an everlasting covenant of salt** - "a covenant made with salt." Salt represented permanence and was used in offerings and covenant meals. AT: "a permanent covenant" or "an everlasting covenant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **You will have no inheritance in the people's land** - God speaks of the land that the other people will possess as if they will inherit it. AT: "You will not possess any of the people's land" or "You will not receive any of the land that the Israelites will possess" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I am your share and inheritance** - God speaks of the great honor that Aaron and his descendants will have by serving him as priests as if God were something that they will inherit. AT: "Instead, I am what you will have" or "Instead, I will allow you to serve me and I will provide for you through that service" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
