===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **The foreigner who is ... He will ... to him** - This does not mean a specific foreigner but it refers to foreigners in general. AT: "The foreigners who are ... They will ... to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **rise up above you higher and higher; you yourself will come down lower and lower** - This idiom means foreigners will have more power, money, and honor than the Israelites. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **he will be the head, and you will be the tail** - This means foreigners will have more power and authority than the Israelites. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:28:13|28:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
