\v 17 From Miletus he sent men to Ephesus and called to himself the elders of the church.
\v 18 When they had come to him, he said to them,
\p "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I always spent my time with you.
\v 19 I kept serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind and with tears, and in sufferings that happened to me because of the plots of the Jews.
\v 20 You know how I did not keep back from declaring to you anything that was useful, and how I taught you in public and from house to house,
\v 21  testifying both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus.
