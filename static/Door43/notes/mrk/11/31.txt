\v 31 They debated among themselves as to what they should answer. They said to each other, "If we say that it was God who authorized him, he will say to us, 'Then you should have believed what John said!'
\v 32 On the other hand, if we say that it was people who authorized John, then what will happen to us?" They were afraid to say that about John, because they knew that the people would be very angry with them. They knew that all the people truly believed that John was a prophet whom God had sent.
\v 33 So they answered Jesus, "We do not know from whom John received his authority." Then Jesus said to them, "Because you did not answer my question, I will not tell you who authorized me to do those things here yesterday."

\v 31 They discussed between themselves and argued and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
\v 32 But if we say, 'From men,' ... " They feared the people, for they all held that John was a prophet.
\v 33 Then they answered Jesus and said, "We do not know." Then Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
