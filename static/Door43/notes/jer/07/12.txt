\v 12 \add Long ago\add* I put my Sacred Tent at Shiloh \add city\add*, to be a place where people would worship me \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\q1 Think about how I \add destroyed it\add* because my people, the Israelite people, did many wicked things there.
\q1
\v 13 And while you were continually doing those wicked things,
\q2 I told you about it many times, but you refused to listen.
\q1 I called out to you,
\q2 but you refused to answer me.
\q1
\v 14 Therefore, just like I destroyed Shiloh, I will now destroy this temple
\q2 that was built for people to worship me \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
\q1 this temple that you trust in,
\q2 in this place that I gave to you and your ancestors.
\q1
\v 15 And I will expel you from this land and send you \add to other countries\add* far away from me,
\q2 just like I did to your relatives, the people of Israel."

\v 12 Long ago I put my sacred tent in the district of Shiloh, to be a place where people would worship me. Think about how I destroyed it because my people, the Israelite people, did many wicked things there.
\v 13 And while you were continually doing those wicked things, I told you about it many times, but you refused to listen. I called out to you, but you refused to answer me.
\v 14 Therefore, just as I destroyed Shiloh, I will now destroy this temple that was built for people to worship me, this temple that you trust in, in this place that I gave to you and your ancestors.
\v 15 And I will expel you from this land and send you to other countries far away from me, just as I did to your relatives, the people of Israel."

\v 12 'So go to my place that was in Shiloh, where I allowed my name to stay there in the beginning, and look at what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel.
\v 13 So now, on account of your doing all of these practices—this is Yahweh's declaration—I spoke to you time and time again, but you did not listen. I summoned you, but you did not answer.
\v 14 Therefore, what I did to Shiloh, I will also do to this house that is called by my name, the house in which you have trusted, this place that I gave to you and your ancestors.
\v 15 For I will send you out from before me just as I had sent out all your brothers, all the descendants of Ephraim.'
