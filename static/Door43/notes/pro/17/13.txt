===== translationNotes: =====

  * **evil will never leave his house** - Here "evil" is spoken of as if it were a person who would not leave the man's house. Here the word "house" may be taken literally, but it is also a metonym for his family. AT: "bad things will continue to happen to him and his family" or "bad things will never stop happening to him and his family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The beginning of conflict is like one who releases water everywhere** - This compares how easily a conflict spreads to how spilled water flows everywhere. AT: "Starting a conflict is like pumping water and letting it run everywhere" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **has broken out** - "starts"or "begins"
