<usfm>
\v 12 So, Son of man, cry and wail,
\q2 because I will use my sword to kill my people,
\q2 including the leaders of Israel.
\q1 That sword will kill them and all the others of my people;
\q2 my sword will kill them all,
\q1 so beat your chests to show that you are sad.
\q1
\v 13 I am about to test my people,
