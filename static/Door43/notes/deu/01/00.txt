=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter forms a continuation with the last chapter of the book of Numbers. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Yahweh's victory ==
The chapter explains that Israel's conquering of the Promised Land will be done by Yahweh. They are not to fear the people of Canaan but be obedient to Yahweh. Yahweh is bringing about his judgement upon the people of Canaan. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland]] and [[:en:obe:kt:judge]])

== Possessing the land ==
While the Promised Land belongs to Israel, they do not possess the land. Possessing the land is an important theme. Posessing the land depended on Israel's faithfulness. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:faithful]])
