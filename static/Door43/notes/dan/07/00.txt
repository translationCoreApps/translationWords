====== Daniel 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===
Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 7:9-14, 23-27, which is the poetic part of the quotation.


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== The four beasts ==

There will be four successive kingdoms before Yahweh sets up his eternal kingdom. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:eternity]])

== The Son of Man ==

God will give the Son of Man an eternal kingdom and he will judge people from the books. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sonofman]] and [[:en:obe:kt:judge]])
