===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to tell Moses what the people must do.

  * **you must not make any** - The word "you" here refers to the people of Israel.
  * **with the same formula** - "with the same ingredients" or "with the same items." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:30:32|30:32]].
  * **It must be most holy to you** - "You must consider it to be most holy"
  * **perfume** - This is a pleasant smelling liquid a person puts on his or her body.
  * **must be cut off from his people** - The metaphor "cut off" has at least three possible meanings. They can be expressed in active form: 1) "I will no longer consider him to be one of the people of Israel" 2)  "the people of Israel must send him away" or 3) "the people of Israel must kill him." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:30:32|30:33]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
