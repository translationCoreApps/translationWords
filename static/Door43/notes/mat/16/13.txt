===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here the scene shifts to a later time. Jesus asks his disciples if they understand who he is.

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline or to introduce a new person. Here Matthew starts to tell a new part of the story.
  * **the Son of Man** - Jesus is referring to himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **the Son of the living God** - This is an important title for Jesus that shows his relationship to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **the living God** - Here "living" contrasts the God of Israel to all the false gods and idols that people worshiped. Only the God of Israel is alive and has power to act.
