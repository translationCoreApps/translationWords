\v 13-14 "\add Going to\add* where people live eternally \add with God in heaven\add* is difficult. \add It is like\add* going along a narrow road \f + \ft personification, metaphor \f* that leads to a narrow gate. Not many people find that way. \add The way\add* that most \add people take\add* is easy, \add but it results in their being punished\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God punishing them\add* \f* \add in hell. That way is like a\add* wide road that people walk on \f + \ft personification, metaphor \f* until they reach the wide gate, but that road and that gate lead to where \add they\add* will be destroyed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will destroy them \f*. Many people enter that gate. So I \add am telling you to leave the wide road and\add* enter the narrow gate \add to heaven\add*."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13-14 "Going to live forever with God in heaven is difficult; it is like a difficult road that you should take.
There is another road, one that most people take. That road is wide; they walk on until they reach a wide gate, but when they go through it, they will die.
So I am telling you to take the difficult road and enter the narrow gate to live forever with God in heaven."

\v 13 Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many people who go through it.
\v 14 But the gate is narrow and the way is difficult that leads to life, and there are few who find it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - When you translate, use appropriate words for "wide" and "broad" that are as different from "narrow" as possible in order to emphasize the differences between the two sets of gates and ways.

  * **Enter through the narrow gate ... few who find it** - This is an image of a person traveling on a road and entering into a kingdom through a gate. One kingdom is easy to enter; the other is hard to enter. This is a metaphor that means a person must accept the more difficult life of obeying God to receive eternal life. If they choose an easier life of not obeying God, they will enter into hell. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Enter through the narrow gate** - You may need to move this to the end of verse 14: "Therefore, enter through the narrow gate."
  * **gate ... way** - Possible meanings are 1) this refers to the gate to enter a kingdom and the road that leads to the gate. If so, you may want to reverse the order as in the UDB. Or, 2) the "gate" and "way" both refer to the entrance to the kingdom. If so, you do not need to change the order.
  * **to destruction ... to life** - These abstract nouns can be translated with verbs. AT: "to the place where you will die ... to the place where you will live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
