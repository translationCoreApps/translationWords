===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **He made him ride on high places of the land** - This is an idiom. The word "him" refers to the people of Israel. AT: "Yahweh made them ride on high places of the land" or "Yahweh helped them take and occupy the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **made him ride ... fed him ... nourished him** - Moses continues to speak of the Israelites as "Jacob" ([[:en:bible:notes:deu:32:09|32:9-10]]). You may need to translate this as though Moses were speaking of the Israelites as many people. "made our ancestors ride ... fed them ... nourished them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **he fed him the fruits of the field** - "he brought him to a land with plenty of crops he could eat" 
  * **he nourished him with honey from the rock, and oil from the flinty crag** - The land had many wild bees, which produce honey, with hives inside rock holes. There were also many olive trees, which provide oil, and grow on rocks, hills, and mountains.
  * **nourished him with honey** - This is like a mother giving her breast to an infant. "allowed him to suck honey" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
