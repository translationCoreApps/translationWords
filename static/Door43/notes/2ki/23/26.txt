\v 26 However, Yahweh did not turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, which had been kindled against Judah for all the pagan worship with which Manasseh had provoked him.
\v 27 So Yahweh said, "I will also remove Judah out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will throw away this city that I have chosen, Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, 'My name will be there.'"
