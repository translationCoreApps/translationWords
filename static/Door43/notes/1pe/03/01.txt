\v 1 You women believers should submit yourselves to your husbands. Do this in order that if any of them do not believe the message about Christ, they may become believers without your having to say anything to them.

\v 1 In this way, you who are wives should submit to your own husbands. Do this so even if some men are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word, through their wives' behavior. 
\v 2 For they will have seen your sincere behavior with respect.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Peter begins to speak specifically to women who are wives.

  * **In this way, you who are wives should submit to your own husbands** - Just as believers are to "Obey every human authority" ([[:en:bible:notes:1pe:02:13|2:13]]) and servants are to "be subject" to their masters ([[:en:bible:notes:1pe:02:18|2:18]]), wives are to submit to their husbands. The words "Obey," "be subject," and "submit" translate the same word. 
  * **some men are disobedient to the word** - Here "the word" refers to the gospel message. To disobey means that they do not believe. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:1pe:02:07|2:8]]. AT: "some men do not believe the message about Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they may be won** - "they may be persuaded to believe in Christ." This means that the unbelieving husbands will become believers. This can be stated in active form. AT: "they may become believers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **without a word** - "without the wife saying a word." Here "a word" refers to words that the wife speaks.
  * **they will have seen your sincere behavior with respect** - Peter speaks of behavior as if it were an object that could be seen, rather than the actions that people carry out. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **your sincere behavior with respect** - Possible meanings are 1) "your sincere behavior toward them and the way that you honor them" (UDB) or 2) "your pure behavior toward them and the way that you honor God."
