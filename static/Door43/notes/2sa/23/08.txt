\v 8 These are the names of David's elite soldiers: Jeshbaal the Hachmonite was the leader of the elite soldiers. He killed eight hundred men on one occasion.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa Jeshbaal \fqb , some versions have \fqa Josheb Basshebah \fqb , \fqa Jashobeam \fqb , \fqa Ishbaal \fqb , or \fqa Ishbosheth \fqb . These all are probably forms of the same name. \f*
