\v 19 But his father refused, saying, "I know that, my son, I know what I am doing. Manasseh's descendants will also become a people-group, and they will become important. But his younger brother's descendants will become greater than his will. His descendants will become several nations."
\v 20 So he blessed them both on that day, saying, "The people in Israel will use your names when they bless people. They will say, 'We pray that God will help you as he helped Ephraim and Manasseh.'~" In that way, Jacob said that Ephraim would become more important than Manasseh.

\v 19 His father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. Yet his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a multitude of nations."
\v 20 Israel blessed them that day with these words,
\q "The people of Israel will pronounce blessings by your names saying, 
\q 'May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh'." 
\m
In this way, Israel put Ephraim before Manasseh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He also will become a people, and he also will be great** - Here "He" refers to Manasseh, but it stands for his descendants. AT: "Your older son will have many descendants, and they will become a great people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **that day with these words** - Here "words" stand for what is said. AT: "that day, saying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The people of Israel will pronounce blessings by your names saying** - "The people of Israel will speak your names when they are blessing others"
  * **by your names saying, 'May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh'** - This is a quotation within a quotation. It can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "by your names. They will ask God to make others like Ephraim and like Manasseh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **like Ephraim and like Manasseh** - Israel saying Ephraim's name first is another way he indicates that Ephraim will be greater than Manasseh.
  * **Israel put Ephraim before Manasseh** - Giving Ephraim the greater blessing and making him more important than Manasseh is spoken of as if Israel physically put Ephraim in front of Manasseh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
