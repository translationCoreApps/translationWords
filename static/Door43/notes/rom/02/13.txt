\v 13  \add It is right for them to be punished\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God to punish them\add* \f* \add because\add* it is not those who  \add merely\add* know God's laws whom he considers to be righteous. On the contrary, it is only those who continually have obeyed  \add all\add* of  \add God's\add* laws\f + \ft Or: of the laws that  \add God gave to Moses\add* \f* whom God will consider righteous\f + \ft Or: whose record of sins God will erase \f*.
\v 14 Whenever the non-Jews, who do not have the laws  \add God gave to Moses\add*, naturally obey those laws, \add they prove that\add* they have a law within their own minds, even though they do not have the laws  \add God gave to Moses\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 It is right for God to punish them because it is not those who know about God's laws that he makes righteous. Only those who have obeyed all of God's law, they are the only ones God makes righteous.
\v 14 Whenever the non-Jews, who do not have the law of God, follow those laws because they obeyed them by the light of nature, they prove that they have a law within themselves, even though they never had the laws that God gave to Moses.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but it is the doers of the law who will be justified.
\v 14 For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things of the law, they, are a law to themselves, although they do not have the law.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues to let the reader know that perfect obedience to God's law is required even for those who never had God's law.

  * **For** - Verses 14 and 15 interrupt Paul's main argument to give the reader extra information. If you have a way to mark an interruption like this in your language, you can use it here. 
  * **it is not the hearers of the law** - Here "the law" refers to the law of Moses. AT: "it is not those who only hear the law of Moses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **who are righteous before God** - "whom God considers righteous"
  * **but it is the doers of the law** - "but it is those who obey the law of Moses"
  * **who will be justified** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "whom God will accept" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Gentiles, who do not have the law ... are a law to themselves** - The phrase "law to themselves" is an idiom that means that these people naturally obey God's laws. AT: "have God's laws already inside them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **they do not have the law** - Here "the law" refers to the law of Moses." AT: "they do not actually have the laws that God gave to Moses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
