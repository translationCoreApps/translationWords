====== 1 Corinthians 15:29-30 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 \add Now think about this: Some among you\add* are being baptized \f + \ft Or: are baptizing people \f* on behalf of those who died \add before someone baptized them\add* \f + \ft Or: who died \add before they became believers\add* \f*. If, \add as some people say, believers\add* will not be raised \add from the dead\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will not cause \add believers\add* to become alive again \f*, what is the value in those people doing that?\f + \ft Or: there is no value in those people doing that! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* If \add God\add* will not cause any \add believers\add* to become alive again, it is senseless to be baptized \f + \ft Or:baptize anyone \f* on behalf of someone who has died.\f + \ft Or: why would someone be baptized ( Or:baptize anyone ) on behalf of someone who has died? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 30 Furthermore, \add if God will not cause us believers to become alive again\add*, it is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* very foolish for me and the other apostles to be constantly \add putting ourselves\add* in danger \add because we tell people God's good message\add*!

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 If there is no resurrection from the dead, as some say, then there is no reason for people to receive baptism for the sake of those who have died, as some do. If God does not bring any dead people back to life, then here is no reason for living people to receive baptism for the sake of those who have died.
\v 30 And we apostles would have no reason to risk our lives every day, as we do, to proclaim the good news if there is no resurrection from the dead.

\v 29 Or else what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are they baptized for them?
\v 30 Why then, are we in danger every hour?
