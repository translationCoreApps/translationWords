\v 26 Yahweh also gave me this message:
\v 27 "You human, the Israelite people are constantly saying about you, 'The things that he sees in visions \add will not happen soon\add*. They are about \add things that will happen\add* many years from now, far in the future.'
\p
\v 28 Therefore say to them, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord \f + \ft doublet \f* says: I will no longer delay \add causing to happen\add* any of the things that I have prophesied. Whatever I have predicted will \add soon\add* happen.'~"

\v 26 Again the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 27 "Son of man! Behold, the house of Israel has said, 'The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of far off times.'
\v 28 Therefore say to them, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: My words will not be delayed any longer, but the word that I have spoken will be doneâ€”this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Behold** - The word "Behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of far off times** - These phrases are both ways the people of Israel are saying Ezekiel's warnings will not happen in their lifetime but will happen far in the future. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **My words will not be delayed any longer, but the word that I have spoken will be done** - These phrases are both ways God is telling the people of Israel that the things he has warned about, will happen soon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the word that I have spoken will be done** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will accomplish the word that I have spoken" or "I will do what I have spoken" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
