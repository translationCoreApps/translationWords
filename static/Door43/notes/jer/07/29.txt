\q
\v 29 Cut off your hair and shave yourself, and throw away your hair. Sing a funeral song over the open places.
\q For Yahweh has rejected and abandoned this generation in his rage.
\v 30 For the sons of Judah have done evil in my eye—this is Yahweh's declaration—they have set their detestable things in the house that is called by my name, in order to defile it.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **sons of Judah** - "descendants of Judah"

  * **abandoned** - "left alone" or "ignored"
  * **in my eye** - "in my sight" or "in my thoughts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:08]].
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself as if he were another person so that Jeremiah and the people of Judah will listen carefully to what he says. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|01:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what Yahweh has said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
