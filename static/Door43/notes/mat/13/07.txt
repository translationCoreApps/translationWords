\v 7 Other seeds fell on ground that had thorny weeds. The thorny weeds grew together with the young plants, and they crowded out the plants.
\v 8 But other seeds fell on good soil, and the plants grew and produced a lot of grain. Some plants produced one hundred times as many seeds as were planted. Some plants produced sixty times as much. Some plants produced thirty times as much.
\v 9 If you are able to understand this, you should consider carefully what I have just said."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus finishes telling a parable about a person who sows seeds.

  * **fell among the thorn plants** - "fell where plants with thorns grew"
  * **choked them** - "choked the new sprouts." Use your word for the way weeds prevent other plants from growing well.
  * **produced grain** - "produced a crop" or "grew more seeds" or "gave fruit"
  * **some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty** - You can make clear the understood information as was done in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **one hundred ... sixty ... thirty** - "100 ... 60 ... 30" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **He who has ears** - This is a way of referring to everyone listening. AT: "Everyone who is listening to me." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:11:13|11:15]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **let him listen** - Here "listen" means paying attention. AT: "must pay careful attention to what I am saying." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:11:13|11:15]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
