====== Jeremiah 11:3-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Then tell them that I, Yahweh, the God whom the Israelite people \add worship\add*, said that I will curse everyone who does not obey what was written in that agreement that I made with them.
\v 4 It is the same agreement that I made with their ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt. \add What happened to them in Egypt was terrible; it was as though they were\add* living in a hot furnace \f + \ft metaphor \f*. When I brought them out of Egypt, I told them to obey me, and to do everything that I had commanded them to do. I also told them that if they obeyed me, they would be my people and I would be their God.
\v 5 \add Now tell these people that if they obey me\add*, I will do what I promised to do for their ancestors. I will enable them to continue living in this very fertile [IDI] land in which they now live."
\p I replied, "Yahweh, I hope that what you said will happen."

<usfm>
\v 3 Say to them, 'Yahweh, God of Israel says this: Cursed is anyone who does not listen to the words of this covenant.
\v 4 This is the covenant that I commanded your ancestors to keep the day I brought them out from the land of Egypt, from the furnace for smelting iron. I said, "Listen to my voice and do all of these things
just as I have commanded you, for you will be my people and I will be your God."
\v 5 Obey me so that I may confirm the oath that I swore to your ancestors, the oath that I would give them the land flowing with milk and honey, where you live today.'" Then I, Jeremiah, answered and said, "Yes, Yahweh!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Cursed is anyone** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will curse anyone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from the land of Egypt, from the furnace for smelting iron** - This speaks of the horrible circumstances and oppression the Israelites were living in in Egypt by comparing them to a smelting furnace. AT: "of Egypt. What happened to them in Egypt was terrible; it was as though they were living in a hot furnace" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **smelting** - heating iron to liquid form
  * **Listen to my voice** - Here what Yahweh says is represented by his "voice." AT: "Listen to what I say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the land flowing with milk and honey** - "the land where milk and honey flow." God spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the milk and honey from those animals and plants were flowing through the land. AT: "the land that is excellent for raising livestock and growing crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
