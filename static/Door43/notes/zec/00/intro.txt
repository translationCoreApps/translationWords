=== What is the Book of Zechariah about? ===

Zechariah wrote to the people of Judah who returned from exile in Babylon. The people of Judah were committing the same sins that caused the exile. Zechariah calls on the people to return to the Lord and renew the covenant with Yahweh. Also, many people were disappointed that the new temple was much smaller than the original temple. He encourages the people and shares the vision about the temple in the future. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]])

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible . "Zechariah" may also be called the "The book about Zechariah" or "The sayings of Zechariah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Zechariah? ===

The prophet Zechariah wrote this book between 520 BC to 480 BC following the ministry of Haggai.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Did Zechariah prophesy before Ezra and Nehemiah? ===

The historical context of this book is likely prior to the lives of Ezra and Nehemiah. The prophecies of Zechariah occur prior to the events of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah and just two months after the prophecies of Haggai.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

== What is the meaning of the term "Israel"? ===

The name "Israel" is used in many different ways in the Bible. The descendants of Jacob, who was also named Israel, were a people group who became known as Israel. This people group developed into the unified nation of Israel. After the civil war in the nation of Israel, the tribes in the north took the name Israel, while the southern kingdom became known as the Kingdom of Judah. Zechariah uses the term "Israel" to refer to both the nation of Israel as well as the northern kingdom of Israel.

=== What imagery does Zechariah use in reference to the Messiah? ===

Zechariah presents the Messiah as both a king and a shepherd. The Messiah will come as a deliverer, yet be "pierced" and "lamented." The Messiah will have great power but will still suffer. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:christ]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lament]])

=== What does the phrase "that day" mean? ===

Zechariah often speaks of the last days by using the phrase "that day" or "in that day." When referencing a future "day," the translator should be aware that it is possible that the author is speaking about the last days. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lastday]])
