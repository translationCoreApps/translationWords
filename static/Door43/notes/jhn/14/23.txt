\v 23 Jesus replied to him, "This is how you can tell whether people love me: whether they do what I have told you to do. Any people like this, my Father will love them. He and I will come to them and live with them.
\v 24 As for those who do not love me, they will not obey what I have told them to do. The things I have told you are not things that I have decided to say on my own; instead, they are things that my Father has sent me to tell you.

\v 23 Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and we will make our home with him.
\v 24 He who does not love me does not keep my words. The word that you hear is not from me but from the Father who sent me.
