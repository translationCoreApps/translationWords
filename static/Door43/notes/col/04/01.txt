  * [[:en:obe:kt:lord]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:servant]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - After speaking to masters, Paul ends his special instructions to the different kinds of believers in the church at Colossae. 

  * **right and fair** - These words mean almost the same thing and are used to emphasize the things that are morally correct. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **you also have a master in heaven** - God wants the relationship between an earthly master and his slave to be loving the way God, the heavenly master, loves his earthly servants, including the earthly slaves' masters.
