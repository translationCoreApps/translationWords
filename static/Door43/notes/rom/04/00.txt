====== Romans 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 4:7-8, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The purpose of the law of Moses ==
Paul builds upon material from chapter 3 and explains how Abraham, the father of Israel, was justified. Obedience cannot justify a person, even the great Abraham. The law of Moses does not justify a person, it is a way a person displays their faith in God. It is faith which has always justified a person. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:justify]], [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])

== Circumcision ==
Circumcision was important to the Israelites. It identified a person as a descendant of Abraham and was a sign of the covenant between Abraham and Yahweh. Paul explains that one of the reasons for circumcision was its practice was a display of the Israelite's faith. The practice of circumcision itself was not able to justify anyone. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:circumcise]] and [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
These are frequently used in this chapter. It appears the intent of these rhetorical questions is to make the reader feel guilty, or to convict them of their sin and ultimately bring them to faith in Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical questions]], [[:en:obe:kt:guilt]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])
