\v 26 John replied, "I am baptizing people with water, but there is now someone standing among you whom you do not know.
\v 27 He follows after me, but I am not important enough even to untie his sandals."
\p
\v 28 These things happened at the village of Bethany over on the east side of the Jordan River. That is the place where John was baptizing.

\v 26 And John answered them, saying, "I baptize with water. But among you stands someone whom you do not know;
\v 27 he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Verse 28 tells us background information about the setting of the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

  * **he who comes after me** - "he will preach to you after I am gone"
  * **the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie** - The task of "untying his sandals," which is the work of a slave or servant, is a metaphor. John is saying that he does not deserve to do even the most unpleasant work of a servant for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
