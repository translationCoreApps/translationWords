====== 1 Corinthians 12:12-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Although a person's body has many parts, all the parts form just one body \f + \ft doublet \f*. It is like that \add with those who belong to\add* Christ.
\v 13 When we were baptized \f + \ft Or:When people baptized us \f*, the one \add Holy\add* Spirit caused us to become one group \add of believers\add*. It does not matter whether we are Jews or non-Jews. It does not matter whether we are slaves or not slaves. \add When we believed in Christ\add*, the one Spirit came to live \f + \ft metaphor \f* within all of us.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 As the human body is a union of many parts, and every part of the body makes the whole, so it is with Christ.
\v 13 For it is by the Spirit of Christ that, when we were baptized, we were each joined together into the body of Christ. It made no difference what our background was, either Jew or Greek, slave or free, but each of us received the gift of the Holy Spirit.

\v 12 For as the body is one and has many members and all are members of the same body, so it is with Christ.
\v 13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bound or free, and all were made to drink of one Spirit.

===== translationNotes: ===== 

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues to talk of the variety of gifts God gives believers, God gives different gifts to different believers, but Paul wants them to know that all believers are made into one body, which is called the body of Christ. For this reason believers should have unity.

  * **For by one Spirit we were all baptized** - Possible meanings are 1) the Holy Spirit is the one who baptizes us, "For one Spirit baptized us" or 2) that the Spirit, like the water of baptism, is the medium through which we are baptized into the body, "For in one Spirit we were all baptized" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **all were made to drink of one Spirit** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God gave all of us the same Spirit, and we share the Spirit as people might share a drink" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
