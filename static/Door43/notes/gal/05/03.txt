====== Galatians 05:3-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Instead, I solemnly declare again to every man who is circumcised \f + \ft Or:has someone circumcise him \f* \add in order for God to accept him\add*, that you must \add perfectly\add* obey all of the laws \add that God gave Moses, in order for God to save you\add*.
\v 4 Those of you who are sure that God will erase the record of your sins because you obey the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add*, you have separated yourselves from Christ. You have abandoned\f + \ft Or: rejected \f* \add God's true method of saving you, which was\add* by kindly erasing the record of your sins, in a way that you did not deserve.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Once again I solemnly declare to every man whom they have circumcised, that he must obey the law perfectly, for God to declare him good in his sight.
\v 4 If you expect God to declare you good in his sight because you try to keep the law, you have separated yourself from Christ; God will no longer act kindly toward you.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Again, I testify to every man who is circumcised that he becomes obliged to obey the whole law.
\v 4 You are separated from Christ, all you who are justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **testify** - "declare" or "serve as a witness"
  * **to every man who is circumcised** - Paul is using circumcision as a metonym for being Jewish. AT: "to every person who has become a Jew" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **obliged** - "bound" or "constrained" or "enslaved"
  * **You are separated from Christ** - "You have ended your relationship with Christ"
  * **all you who are justified by the law** - Paul is speaking ironically here. He actually teaches that no Jew can be justified by trying to do the deeds required by the law. AT: "all you who think you can be justified by doing the deeds required by the law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **You have fallen away from grace** - Paul is speaking of a person who decides that he does not need or want the grace of Christ as if he were someone who falls from a good high place to a bad lower place. AT: "God will not give you the gift of eternal life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
