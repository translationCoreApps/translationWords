\v 18 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal; she was the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.
\v 19 He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh; he did all that Jehoiakim had done.
\v 20 Through Yahweh's anger, all these events happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he drove them out of his presence. Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

  * **He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh** - The nominal adjective "evil" can be translated as a relative clause "things that ... evil." Here Yahweh's "sight" refers to how he judges or decides on the value of something. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:03:01|3:2]]. AT: "He did things that Yahweh said were evil" or "He did the things that Yahweh considers evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
