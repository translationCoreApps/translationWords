  * [[:en:obe:other:vision]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But even these** - "But even the leaders"
  * **The priest and the prophet** - This does not mean a specific priest or prophet. It refers to priests and prophets in general. AT: "The priests and the prophets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the priests and the prophets cannot do their job because they are very drunk. AT: "stumble around because they are drunk" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **they are swallowed up by wine** - Their drinking so much that they can no longer think properly is spoken of as if the wine swallowed them. This can be stated in active form. AT: "the wine is causing them to be confused" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **staggering in vision and reeling in decision** - Just like they are too drunk to walk correctly, they are too drunk to understand the visions God gives them or to make good decisions.
