===== translationNotes: =====

  * **How long will it be ... swallow down my own saliva?** - Here Job conveys a single idea using two different rhetorical questions to emphasize his wish that God would stop watching him. AT: "Look away from me! Leave me alone long enough for me to swallow my own saliva!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[ en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **saliva** - liquid produced in people's mouths that keeps the mouth moist and helps to swallow food
  * **Even if I have sinned ... burden for you?** - Job poses these questions to argue against God treating him unfairly. AT: "Even if I have sinned, that would do nothing to you, as you watch over people. Tell me why you have made me your target, so that I am a burden for you." (See: [[ en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
