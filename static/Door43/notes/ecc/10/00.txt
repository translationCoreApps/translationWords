====== Ecclesiastes 10 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 10, which is an extended quotation. Some lines are indented twice to further set them apart. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Advice ==
This chapter gives a series of disconnected pieces of advice. Translators should not try to smooth the transitions between these pieces of advice. The advice in these statements do not apply in every situation. Therefore, they should be seen as "good ideas."
