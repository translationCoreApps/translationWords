\v 8 Then Abner was very angry at the words of Ishbosheth and said, "Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? Today I am showing faithfulness to the house of Saul, your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, by not delivering you into the hand of David. And yet you accuse me about this woman today?
