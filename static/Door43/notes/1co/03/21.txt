\v 21 So stop boasting about how good one Christian leader is or how good another Christian leader is. For God has given you all things.
\v 22 God gave you Paul, and he gave you Apollos, and Peter. And God gave you this world, and your life, and his victory over death. And God gives you everything that exists and everything that will exist in the futureâ€”they are all yours;
\v 23 and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.

\v 23 and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
