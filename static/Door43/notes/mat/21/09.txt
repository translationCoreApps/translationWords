===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Hosanna** - This word means "save us" but can also mean "praise God!"
  * **the son of David** - Jesus was not David's literal son, so this may be translated as "descendant of king David" (UDB). However, "Son of David" is also a title for the Messiah, and the crowd was probably calling Jesus by this title.
  * **in the name of the Lord** - Here "in the name" means "in the power" or "as a representative." AT: "in the power of the Lord" or "as the representative of the Lord" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Hosanna in the highest** - Here "highest" refers to God who rules from the highest heaven. AT: "Praise God, who is in the highest heaven" (UDB) or "Praise be to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **all the city was stirred** - Here "city" refers to the people living there. AT: "many people from all over the city were stirred" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **stirred** - "excited"
