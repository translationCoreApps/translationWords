\v 48 But if an evil servant says in his heart, 'My master has been delayed,'
\v 49 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eats and drinks with drunkards;
\v 50 then the master of that servant will come on a day that the servant does not expect and at an hour that he does not know.
\v 51 His master will cut him in pieces and make his fate the same as that of the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus concludes his proverb of a master and servants to illustrate that his disciples should be prepared for his return. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]])

  * **says in his heart** - Here "heart" refers to the mind. AT: "thinks in his mind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **My master has been delayed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "My master is slow to return" or "My master will not return for a long time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **on a day that the servant does not expect and at an hour that he does not know** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. They emphasize that the master will come when the servant is not expecting him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **make his fate** - "treat him"
  * **cut him in pieces** - This is an idiom that means to make the person suffer terribly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **weeping and grinding of teeth** - This represents extreme sadness and suffering. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:11|8:12]].
