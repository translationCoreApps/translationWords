====== 2 Timothy 01 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Spiritual children ==

Paul calls Timothy his "son." Paul was very involved in discipling Timothy. Because of this relationship, he called him his "spiritual" son. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:disciple]] and [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]])


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Persecution ==
Both Paul and Timothy were suffering persecution when this letter was written. Paul takes the time to encourage Timothy in the midst of these difficulties. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
