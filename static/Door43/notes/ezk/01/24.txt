===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Ezekiel continues to tell about his vision of the living creatures.

  * **Then I heard the sound of their wings. Like the noise of rushing water. Like the voice of the Almighty whenever they moved. Like** - Other possible meanings are that the words "whenever they moved" refer to 1) all the words before them in this verse, "Whenever they moved, I heard the sound of their wings. Like the noise of rushing water. Like the voice of the Almighty. Like" (see UDB), or 2) to the words that follow, "wings. Like the noise of rushing water. Like the voice of the Almighty. Whenever they moved, it sounded like."
  * **Like ... water. Like ... moved. Like ... rainstorm. Like ... army.** - These sentences are not complete because Ezekiel was showing that he was excited about what he saw. They can be translated as complete sentences: "The wings sounded like ... water. They sounded like ... moved. They sounded like ... rainstorm. They sounded like ... army." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
  * **rushing water** - This simply means "a lot of water." It could refer to "a loud river" or "a large waterfall" or "the waves crashing at the ocean". All of these are very loud.
