====== Jeremiah 35:15-16 ======

<usfm>
\v 15 Many times I sent prophets to you. They told you, 'Turn away from your wicked behavior, and do things that you should do. Stop worshiping other gods, in order that you will be able to live peacefully in this land that I gave to you and your ancestors.' But you would not pay attention to what I said or obey me.
\v 16 The descendants of Jehonadab have obeyed their ancestor, but you have refused to pay attention to what I told you.

\v 15 I sent out to you all my servants, the prophets. I was persistent in sending them to say, 'Let each person turn from his wicked way and do good deeds; let no one walk any longer after other gods and worship them. Instead, come back to the land that I gave to you and your ancestors.' Yet you will not listen to me or pay attention to me.
\v 16 For the descendants of Jonadab son of Rechab have observed the commands of their ancestor that he gave them, but this people refuses to listen to me."'
