===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do not abandon me ... do not stay far away from me** - These phrases have very similar meaning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **do not stay far away from me** - Because Yahweh has not yet answered the writer's request, the writer speaks of Yahweh as if he was standing far away from the writer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Come quickly to help me** - God is spoken of as if he is running to the writer to help him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my salvation** - The abstract noun "salvation" can be stated as an action. AT: "you are the one who saves me" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
