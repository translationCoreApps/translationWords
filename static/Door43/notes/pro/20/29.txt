===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Blows that make a wound cleanse away evil and beatings make the innermost parts clean** - Both statements mean the same thing and are repeated for emphasis. Using physical punishment to correct a person is spoken of as if the evil were dirt and the beatings cleansed him. AT: "Beating a person who has done wrong will correct him and cause him to be a better person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
