\v 30 Therefore, say this to the Israelite people \f + \ft metonymy \f*: 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: You are going to \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* defile yourselves like your ancestors did by strongly desiring \add to worship\add* their disgusting statues of idols.
\v 31 When you sacrifice your children in the fire, you are still continuing to make yourselves unacceptable to me by \add worshiping\add* your many idols. You Israelite people, should I allow you to inquire \add what I want you to do\add*? I, Yahweh the Lord, say that as surely as I am alive, \add I will not answer\add* if you inquire'.
\p
\v 32 You say, 'We want to be like the other nations, like the other people-groups in the world. We want to worship \add idols made of\add* wood and stone \add like they do\add*.' But what you want will never happen.

\v 30 Therefore, say this to the Israelite people: 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: Why do you imitate your ancestors in acting in ways that make me unable to accept you? You act like prostitutes, leaving their husbands for other men. In the same way, you have left me to worship dusgusting idols.
\v 31 When you sacrifice your children in the fire, you make me unable to accept you. It is the same as when you bow down to your idols. You Israelite people, should I allow you to ask me to direct you in any matter? I, Yahweh the Lord, say that as surely as I am alive, I will not answer if you ask me.'
\p
\v 32 You say, 'We want to be like the other people groups in the world. We want to worship idols made of wood and stone like they do.' But what you want will never happen.'

<usfm>
\v 30 Therefore say to the house of Israel, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: Why do you make yourselves unclean with the ways of your fathers? And why do you act like prostitutes, searching for disgusting things?
\v 31 For when you offer up your gifts and you put your sons into the fire, and to this day you make yourselves unclean with all your idols. And so should I let you question me, house of Israel? As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—I will not let you question me.
\v 32 The thought that is forming in your mind will come true. You say, "Let us be like the other nations, like the clans in the other lands who worship wood and stone."
