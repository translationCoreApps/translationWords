\v 13 That evening quails appeared, and there were so many that they covered the campsite. The next morning there was something like small drops of water all around the campsite.
\v 14 When the water dried up, on the ground there was a thin layer of something that looked like small white flakes. It looked like ice laying on the ground.
\v 15 When the Israelite people saw it, since they had never seen it before and did not know what it was, they said to each other, "What is it?" Moses replied to them, "It is something Yahweh has given you to eat, to take the place of bread.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It came about ... that** - This phrase is used here to mark an important part of the events. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **quails** - These are small, plump birds. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **like frost** - The original readers knew what frost is like, so this phrase would help them understand what the flakes were like. Frost is frozen dew that forms on the ground. It is very fine. AT: "that looked like frost" or "that was fine like frost"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **bread** - Moses speaks of the food that God sent as if it were bread. The Israelites would eat this food every day, just as they had eaten bread every day before this. AT: "food" or "food like bread." See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:16:04|16:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
