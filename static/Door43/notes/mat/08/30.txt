\v 30 Now a herd of many pigs was there feeding, not too far away from them.
\v 31 The demons kept imploring Jesus and saying, "If you cast us out, send us away into that herd of pigs."
\v 32 Jesus said to them, "Go!" The demons came out and went into the pigs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep hill into the sea and they died in the water.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Matthew tells background information about a herd of pigs that had been there before Jesus arrived. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **If you cast us out** - It is implied that the demons knew that Jesus was going to cast them out. AT: "Because you are going to cast us out" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **us** - This is exclusive, meaning the demons only. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **to them** - This refers to the demons inside the men.
  * **The demons came out and went into the pigs** - "The demons left the man and entered the pigs"
  * **behold** - This alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **rushed down the steep hill** - "ran quickly down the steep slope"
  * **died in the water** - "they fell into the water and drowned"
