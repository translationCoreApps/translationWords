\v 31 Jesus also told this parable: "The \add number of\add* \f + \ft (OR\add , God's influence in the lives of\add*) \f* \add people whose\add* lives God rules over \add will continue to grow. It is very much\add* like mustard seeds grow after a man plants them in his field.
\v 32 Although mustard seeds are among the smallest of all the seeds\add that people plant, here in Israel they become large plants. When the plants have fully grown, they are larger than the other garden plants. They become shrubs that are large enough for the birds to build nests in their branches."\add* \p

\v 31 Jesus also told this parable: "When God rules from heaven, it is like mustard seeds that grow after a man plants them in his field.
\v 32 Although mustard seeds are among the smallest of all the seeds that people plant, here in Israel they become large plants. When the plants have fully grown, they are larger than the other garden plants. They become shrubs as big as trees, and they are large enough for the birds to build nests in their branches."

\v 31 Then Jesus presented another parable to them. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field. 
\v 32 This seed is indeed the smallest of all other seeds. But when it has grown, it is greater than the garden plants. It becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches."
