===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The angel of Yahweh** - Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh made himself look like an angel or 2) this was one of Yahweh's angels or 3) this was a special messenger from God (some scholars think it was Jesus). Since the phrase is not well understood, it is best to simply translate it as "the angel of Yahweh" using the normal word that you use for "angel."
  * **wilderness** - The wilderness area she went to was a desert. AT: "desert" 
  * **Shur** - This was the name of a place south of Canaan and east of Egypt.
  * **my mistress** - Here this refers to Sarai. A mistress has authority over her slave. AT: "my owner." See how "her mistress" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:16:01|16:4]].
