====== Ezekiel 43:6-8 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Then while the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speak to me from inside the temple.
\v 7 He said, "You human, this is my temple, the place where \add I sit on\add* my throne and where I rest my feet. This is where I will live with the Israelite people forever. The Israelite people and their kings will never again disgrace me \f + \ft synecdoche \f* by worshiping other gods \f + \ft metaphor \f* at the shrines on their hilltops, or by building monuments to honor their kings who have died.
\v 8 They placed their altars near mine, and the doorposts of their temples were next to the doorposts of my temple. There was only a wall between them. And they disgraced me by the detestable things that they did. So, being very angry with them, I got rid of them.

\v 6 Then, while the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speak to me from inside the temple.
\v 7 He said, "Son of man, this is my temple, the place where I sit on my throne and where I rest my feet. This is where I will live with the Israelite people forever. The Israelite people and their kings will never again disgrace me by worshiping other gods at their hilltop places of idol worship, or by building lifeless idols of their past kings.
\v 8 Your people placed their altars near mine, and the doorposts of their temples were next to the doorposts of my temple. There was only a wall between them. And they disgraced me by the detestable things that they did. So I was angry and destroyed them.

\v 6 The man was standing beside me, and I heard someone else speaking to me from the house.
\v 7 He said to me, "Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet, where I will live in the midst of the people of Israel forever. The house of Israel will no longer profane my holy name—they or their kings—with their faithlessness or with the corpses of their kings at their high places.
\v 8 They will no longer profane my holy name by putting their threshold next to my threshold, and their gateposts next to my gateposts, with nothing but a wall between me and them. They profaned my holy name with their disgusting actions, so I consumed them with my anger.

===== translationNotes: =====
 
  * **the corpses of their kings'** - Here "corpses" refers to the idols that the people's kings worshiped. The idols are called corpses because they are not alive. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They profaned** - "The house of Israel profaned"
  * **disgusting actions** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:09|5:9]].
  * **consumed them with my anger** - This phase means "I completely destroyed them because I was angry." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
