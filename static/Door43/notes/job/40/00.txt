====== Job 40 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

 Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 40:1-2, 4-5, 7-24, which are extended quotations of Job and Yahweh. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Job's righteousness ==
In seeking to defend his own righteousness, Job accuses Yahweh of being unjust. Yahweh asks a very important question: "Will you condemn me so you may claim you are right?" This is the essence of Job's error. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Irony ==
Yahweh states, "He who argues with God, let him answer." Job immediately answers him. This is irony. While Job is forced to acknowledge the power of Yahweh, he does not repent of his former statements. Because of this, Yahweh asks him more questions. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:repent]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Animals ==
There are several animals mentioned in this chapter that do not exist and may never have existed. It may be necessary to leave these names untranslated or to translate their names as adjectives.
