===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues speaking to the crowd.

  * **I have come as a light** - Here the "light" is a metaphor for Jesus' example. AT: "I have come to show the truth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **may not remain in the darkness** - Here "darkness" is a metaphor for living in ignorance of God's truth. AT: "may not continue to be spiritually blind."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world** - Here "to judge the world" implies condemnation. Jesus did not come to condemn people. AT: "If anyone hears my teaching and rejects it, I do not condemn him. I have not come to condemn people. Instead, I have come to save those who trust in me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the world** - Here "the world" is a metonym that represents all of the people in the world. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
