===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do not boast about tomorrow** - This is a warning not to brag about what you expect to happen tomorrow. This can be stated clearly. AT: "Do not speak proudly about your plans for tomorrow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **what a day may bring** - Something happening on a certain day is spoken of as if the day were to bring that event. AT: "what will happen on a day" or "what will happen tomorrow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your own mouth ... your own lips** - These two phrases refer to the "mouth" and "lips" as speaking because those are parts of the body that are used for speaking. AT: "yourself ... yourself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **a stranger and not your own lips** - The missing words can be supplied from the phrase before this. AT: "let a stranger praise you and not your own lips" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
