\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* people build and prepare a road \add for a king to come on\add*.
\q1 Get rid of \add the things that are causing you to sin\add*
\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* people remove from a road obstacles\f + \ft Or: things that cause people to stumble \f*.
\q1

\q1 I live in the highest heaven, where \add everything\add* is holy,
\q2 but I also am with those who are humble and who are sorry for the sinful things that they have done.

\q1
\v 14 He will say,
\q1 'Build, build! Clear a way! Remove all the stumbling blocks from the path of my people!'"

\q1 "I live in the exalted and holy place,
with him also that is of a crushed and humble spirit,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Build, build! Clear a way! Remove all the stumbling blocks from the path of my people** - Yahweh is emphatic and urgent that a clear and level road be available for the people to return to him and free of obstacles to worshiping Yahweh. This echoes [[:en:bible:notes:isa:40:03|40:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For this is what the high and elevated One says** - The words "high" and "elevated" have basically the same meaning here and emphasize Yahweh being exalted. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:06:01|6:1]] and [[:en:bible:notes:isa:33:10|33:10]]. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:52:13|52:13]].
  * **to revive the spirit of the humble ones, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh will strengthen and encourage those who humble themselves before him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **spirit ... heart** - Here these refer to a person's thoughts and emotions, not the spirit and heart literally. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
