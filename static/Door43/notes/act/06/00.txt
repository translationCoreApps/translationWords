====== Acts 06 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Favoritism ==
There was priority given to those in need based on where they were from. The Jewish widows (who were probably Jewish Christians) from Israel were given priority over the Jewish widows (who were probably Jewish Christians) from Greece. 

== Deacons ==
The church establishes leaders to serve over the practical needs of the church. This is probably the practice that lead to the formation of the office of deacon, described elsewhere in the New Testament.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "His face was like the face of an angel" ==
All cultures have different images associated with angels. It is important to avoid these connotations present in the background of the translator's culture. It is possible that his face was "shining" like an angel; regardless, it is probably an indication of his holiness or righteousness in the midst of this trial. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:holy]] or [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]])
