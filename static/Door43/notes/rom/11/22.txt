\v 22 Look at, then, the kind actions and the severity of God. On the one hand, severity came on the Jews who fell. But on the other hand, God's kindness comes on you, if you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the kind actions and the severity of God** - Paul is reminding the Gentile believers that although God may act very kindly toward them, he will not hesitate to judge and punish them.
  * **severity came on the Jews** - Paul speaks of "severity" as if it were alive and in motion. You can make explicit that God had to deal harshly with the Jewish people. AT: "God dealt harshly with the Jews" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]],[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Otherwise you also will be cut off** - Paul again uses the metaphor of a branch, which God can "cut off" if he needs to. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "Otherwise God will cut you off" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
