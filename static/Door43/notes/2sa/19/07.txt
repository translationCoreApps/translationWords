\v 7 Now therefore get up and go out and speak kindly to your soldiers, for I swear by Yahweh, if you do not go, not one man will remain with you tonight. That would be worse for you than all the disasters that have ever happened to you from your youth until now."
\v 8 So the king got up and sat in the city gate, and it was told to all the men, "Look, the king is sitting in the gate." Then all the people came before the king.
\p Meanwhile, in Israel, every man had fled to his home.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I swear by Yahweh** - Joab is making a very strong oath.
  * **if you do not go, not one man will remain** - This means that only if David went would his soldiers remain with him. AT: "only if you go will any of your men remain" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **all the people** - Here "the people" refers to the nation of Israel. This is an exaggeration because the entire nation was not told. It means a large number were told and many came and gathered around him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Meanwhile** - This describes the what was happening while the events of [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:19:01|19:1-8]] were taking place.
