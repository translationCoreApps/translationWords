\v 13 When he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer.
\v 14 When she recognized Peter's voice, out of joy she failed to open the door; instead, she came running into the room; she reported that Peter was standing at the door.
\v 15 So they said to her, "You are insane." But she insisted that it was so. They said, "It is his angel."
