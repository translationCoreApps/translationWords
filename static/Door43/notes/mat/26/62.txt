\v 62 The high priest stood up and said to him, "Do you have no answer? What is it that they are testifying against you?"
\v 63 But Jesus was silent. The high priest said to him, "I command you by the living God, tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."
\v 64 Jesus replied to him, "You have said it yourself. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **What is it that they are testifying against you?** - The chief priest is not asking Jesus for information about what the witnesses said. He is asking Jesus to prove what the witnesses said is wrong. AT: "What is your response to what the witnesses are testifying against you?"
  * **Son of God** - This is an important title that describes the relationship between the Christ and God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **the living God** - Here "living" contrasts the God of Israel to all the false gods and idols that people worshiped. Only the God of Israel is alive and has power to act. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:16:13|16:16]].
  * **You have said it yourself** - This is an idiom that Jesus uses to mean "yes" without being completely clear about what he means. AT: "You are saying it" or "You are admitting it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **But I tell you, from now on you** - Here "you" is plural. Jesus is speaking to the high priest and to the other persons there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **from now on you will see the Son of Man** - Possible meanings are 1) the phrase "from now on" is an idiom that means they will see the Son of Man in his power at some time in the future or 2) the phrase "from now on" means that from the time of Jesus' trial and onward, Jesus is showing himself to be the Messiah who is powerful and victorious.
  * **the Son of Man** - Jesus is speaking about himself in third person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **at the right hand of Power** - Here "Power" refers to God. AT: "at the right hand of Almighty God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **coming on the clouds of heaven** - "riding to earth on the clouds of heaven"
