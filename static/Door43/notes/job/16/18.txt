===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Earth, do not cover up my blood** - Jobs speaks to the "earth" directly even though it cannot hear him, to add strength to his statement. The earth is personified as purposefully covering up his blood after he dies. AT: "I wish my blood would not soak into the ground but that it would remain on top of the ground as proof of how I died"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Earth, do not cover up my blood** - Job speaks of himself dying as if he would be murdered. Here his "blood" is a metonym referring to his death. AT: "Earth, when I die, do not hide how I die unfairly" or "Let it not be hidden how I die unfairly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **let my cry have no resting place** - Job speaks of wanting everyone to know what happened to him as if his "cry" were a person that never stopped testifying to what happened to him and never rested. AT: "Let everyone hear about what has happened to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **see** - Job uses this word to draw attention to what he says next. AT: "listen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **my witness is in heaven** - Job trusts that someone will speak up for him to God.
  * **vouches** - "testifies" 
  * **on high** - This is an idiom. AT: "in heaven" or "in heaven on high" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
