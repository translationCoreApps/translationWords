<usfm>
\v 8 The beast that you saw lived previously. Eventually God will destroy him, but now he is not alive. He is about to come up from the shaft that went down but had no ending. When that beast appears again, the people on the earth will be amazed. They are people whose names have not been written in the Book of Life before God created the world.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 The beast you saw existed, does not exist now, but is about to come up from the bottomless pit. Then it will go on to destruction. Those who live on the earth, those whose names have not been written in the book of life since the foundation of the worldâ€”they will be astounded when they see the beast that existed, does not exist now, but is about to come.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the bottomless pit** - This is an extremely deep narrow hole. Possible meanings are 1) the pit has no bottom; it continues to go down further forever or 2) the pit is so deep that it is as if it had no bottom. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:09:01|9:1]].
  * **Then it will go on to destruction** - The noun "destruction" can be translated with a verb. AT: "Then he will be destroyed" or "Then God will destroy him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **it will go on to destruction** - The certainty of what will happen in the future is spoken of as if the beast were going to it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **those whose names have not been written** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "those whose names God did not write" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **since the foundation of the world** - "before God created the world"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
