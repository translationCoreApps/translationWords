===== translationNotes: =====

  * **As she got up to gather up grain, Boaz commanded his young men** - In the context of the commands, it is likely that Ruth was far enough away not to hear Boaz's instructions. AT: "And when Ruth got up to gather up grain, Boaz privately told his young men"
  * **As she got up** - "As she stood up"
  * **even among the bundles** - Here "even" denotes "above and beyond what one normally does." Boaz instructs his workers to let Ruth glean around the bundles of grain. People who were gleaning were normally forbidden from working that close to the harvested grain.
  * **pull out for her some ears of grain from the bundles** - "take some stalks of grain out of the bundles and leave them for her" or "leave behind stalks of grain for her to collect"
  * **do not rebuke her** - "do not cause her shame" or "do not dishonor her"
