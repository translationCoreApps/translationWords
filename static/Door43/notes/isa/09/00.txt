====== Isaiah 09 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter begins with a prophecy that is a continuation of the prophecy concluding the previous chapter. Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 9:1-22, which is an extended quotation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Messiah ==
The prophecy in 9:1-7 is about the coming messiah. Parts of this prophecy were fulfilled when he first came to earth. Other parts are to be fulfilled when he will return in glory to earth. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:christ]] and [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Fulfillment of prophecies ==
