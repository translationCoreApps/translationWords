====== Proverbs 30:7-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 God, I ask you to do two things for me;
\q2 please do them before I die:
\q1
\v 8 Prevent me from lying or deceiving people
\q2 and do not cause me to become poor or to become rich.
\q2 Just give me the food that I need;
\q1
\v 9 because if I become rich,
\q2 I might say that I do not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* know you and that I do not need you;
\q1 and if I become poor,
\q2 I might dishonor you by stealing things.

\b
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 I ask Yahweh for two things,
\q2 and that he give them to me before I die.
\q1
\v 8 Put vain pride and lies far away from me;
\q2 and let me neither have poverty or riches,
\q2 just give me the food I need every day.
\v 9 For if I have too much money,
\q2 it is possible that I will deny my God and say, "Who is Yahweh?"
\q2 Or it is possible that I will become so poor that I steal from others
\q2 and bring disgrace on the name of my God.


\q1

\v 7 Two things I ask of you,
\q do not withhold them from me before I die:
\q
\v 8 Put vanity and lies far away from me.
\q Give me neither poverty nor riches,
\q just give me the food I need.
\q
\v 9 For if I have too much, I might deny you and say, "Who is Yahweh?"
\q Or if I become poor,
\q I might steal and profane the name of my God.

  * **vanity** - false, useless words
  * **Give me neither poverty nor riches** - The writer speaks as if "poverty" and "riches"—abstract nouns that can be translated as adjectives—were physical objects that someone could give to another.

  * **if I have too much, I might deny you and say** - This describes a hypothetical situation that has not happened but is possible if the writer becomes rich. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
