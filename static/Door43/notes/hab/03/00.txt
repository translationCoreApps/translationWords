====== Habakkuk 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:1-20, which is a prayer by Habakkuk.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Poetry ==
Although this is a prayer, it is in the form of poetry. Habakkuk uses startling imagery to show his fear of Yahweh (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:obe:kt:fear]])
