  * **Blessed will be** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will bless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **your basket and your kneading trough** - Israelites used a basket to carry grain. A "kneading trough" was a bowl they used to mix the grain and make bread. AT: "all the food you grow and all the food you eat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **when you come in ... when you go out** - This merism refers to all of life's activities everywhere they go. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
