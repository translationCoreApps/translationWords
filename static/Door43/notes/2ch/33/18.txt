\v 18 As to the other matters concerning Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the deeds of the kings of Israel.
\v 19 In that account there is history of his prayer, and how God was moved by it. There is also an account of all his sin and his trespasses, and the places where he had built high places and set up the Asherah poles and the carved figures, before he humbled himself—they are written about in the Chronicles of the Seers.
\f + \ft Some modern versions have \fqa the Chronicles of Hozai \fqb , which is the reading of the original text. But many modern versions correct it to read \fqa the Chronicles of the Seers \fqb . Also, a few modern versions have \fqa the Chronicles of his seers \fqb . \f*
\v 20 So Manasseh slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in his own house. Amon, his son, became king in his place.
