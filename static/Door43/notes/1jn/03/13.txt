===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 You should not be amazed\f + \ft Or: surprised \f*, my fellow believers, when \add unbelievers\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* hate you.
\v 14 We know that we have been changed from \add being spiritually\add* dead \f + \ft metaphor \f* to \add being spiritually\add* alive. We know this because we love our fellow believers. \add Those who\add* do not love \add their fellow believers\add* are still \add spiritually\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* dead.
\v 15 Those who hate \add any of\add* their fellow believers, \add God considers\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* them \add to be\add* murderers. And you know that no murderer has eternal life.

\v 13 You should not be amazed when unbelievers hate you.
\v 14 Because we love our fellow believers, we know that God has made us to live forever with him. But God regards anyone who does not love their fellow believer as a person who is not living in life but is living under the power of death.
\v 15 God treats anyone who hates their fellow believers as though they had done something just as bad as committing murder. Anyone who does not love his brother is living for death, not life.

\p
\v 13 Do not be amazed, my brothers, if the world hates you.
\v 14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Anyone who does not love remains in death.
\v 15 Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer. And you know that eternal life does not remain in a murderer.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **brothers** - "fellow believers"
  * **if the world hates you** - Here the word "world" refers to the people who do not honor God. AT: "if those who do not honor God hate you who do honor God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **we have passed out of death into life** - The conditions of living and of being dead are spoken of as if they were physical locations from which a person could leave and go to. AT: "we are no longer spiritually dead but are spiritually alive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **life** - The word "life" throughout this letter refers to more than physical life. It stands here for Jesus, the eternal life. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:01:01|1:1-2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **remains in death** - "is still spiritually dead"
  * **Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer** - John speaks of a person who hates another believer as if he were a murderer. Since people commit murder because they hate other people, God considers anyone who hates to be as guilty as someone who kills a person. AT: "Whoever hates another believer is as guilty as someone who kills a person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **eternal life does not remain in a murderer** - "Eternal life" is something God gives believers after they die, but it is also a power God gives believers in this life to help them to stop sinning and to do what please him. Here eternal life is spoken of as if it were an object that could be in someone. AT: "a murderer does not have the power of spiritual life working inside of him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
