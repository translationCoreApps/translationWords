\v 13 Then virgins will rejoice with dancing, and young and old men will be together.

\q My people will fill themselves with my goodnessâ€”this is Yahweh's declaration."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will change their mourning into celebration** - The abstract nouns "mourning" and "celebration" can be translated as verbs. AT: "I will cause them to mourn no longer but instead to celebrate" or "I will make it so they are no longer sad but happy"
  * **I will change** - Yahweh will change
  * **will saturate the lives of the priests in abundance** - The abstract noun "abundance" can be translated as "many good things." The lives of the priests are spoken of as if they were a field that would become completely wet when much rain falls on it. Life is a metonym for the person. AT: "I will give the priests all the good things they would like" or "I will satisfy the priests with good things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **My people will fill themselves with my goodness** - "My goodness will satisfy my people"
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
