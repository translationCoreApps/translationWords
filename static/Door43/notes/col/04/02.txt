====== Colossians 04:2-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 2 Pray to God persistently, and as you pray be alert and be thanking God.
\v 3 Since I am in prison \f + \ft metonymy \f* because \add I declared the message about Christ\add* that God has now revealed, pray also for me that God will give me opportunities \f + \ft metonymy \f* to speak, in order that I might declare it.
\v 4 That is, pray for me that \add God will enable me to\add* make his message known publicly. I need to do this because I know that I should declare it.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 2 Keep praying without stopping. Do not be lazy, but instead keep praying and thanking God.
\v 3 Pray together for us too, so that God will make it possible for us to freely explain the good news, the secret about Christ that God is now revealing everywhere. It is because we proclaimed this good news that I am now in prison.
\v 4 Pray that I might be able to fully explain the good news.

===== ULB: =====

\p
\v 2 Continue steadfastly in prayer. Stay alert in it in thanksgiving.
\v 3 Pray together for us also, that God would open a door for the word, to speak the secret truth of Christ. Because of this, I am chained up.
\v 4 And pray that I may make it clear, as I ought to speak.
