Chapter 6 continues a collection of proverbs that ends in chapter nine. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== My Son ==

Occasionally, the author addresses a proverb to "my son." This is not intended to restrict the words of that proverb to only males. Instead, it is simply a form used to pass on advice as a father does to his son. 

== Adulteress ==

The latter part of this chapter comes back to the theme about the adulteress and warns the young man to avoid her. An adulteress is a woman who commits adultery. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:adultery]])

== Numbers ==

Occasionally, the author will mention a list of 6 things or 7 things, that Yahweh hates, these numbers are used to drawn attention to the list of things. It is not important whether it is 6 or 7 in the list.

The author will use rhetorical questions to draw the reader's attention to important points. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

== Animals Used as Types ==

The gazelle and the ant have certain characteristics which author uses to give wisdom. If your language does not recognize these characteristics in those animals you could add a footnote to explain or possibly substitute another animal from your culture that would help explain the same concept. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:wise]])
