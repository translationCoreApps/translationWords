\v 23 Joseph said to the people who sold themselves and their land to him, "Listen to me! Today I have bought you and your land for the king. So here are seeds for you so that you can plant them in the ground.
\v 24 But when you harvest the crop, you must give one-fifth of the crop to the king. The rest of the crop you can keep, to be seed to plant in the fields, and to be food for you and your children and for everyone else in your household to eat."
