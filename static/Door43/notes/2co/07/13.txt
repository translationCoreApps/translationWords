He told me, Or: us that\add* he did not need to worry anymore, because \add he saw\add* that you all \add had a good attitude toward me\add*.
\v 14 I had told Titus that I was pleased about you. And I did not need to be ashamed \add for having boasted about you like that, because you did what I knew that you would do\add*. Just like everything that I have taught you \add and written to you\add* has been the truth, just as the good things that I told Titus about you were also true.

\v 13 By all of this we are very encouraged!
\p We were so happy about what Titus told us, and we were also happy because you had given him rest and helped him.
\v 14 I told him very good things about you, how proud I was of you, and you did not put me to shame when he came to you. We praised you so much to Titus, and you proved it was all true!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 It is by this that we are encouraged.
\p
In addition to our own comfort, we also rejoiced even more because of Titus' joy, because his spirit was refreshed by all of you.
\v 14 For if I boasted to him about you, I was not embarrassed. On the contrary, just as everything we said to you was true, our boasting about you to Titus proved to be true.
