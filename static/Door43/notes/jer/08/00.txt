====== Jeremiah 08 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 8:5-22, which are extended quotations.

The prophecy revealed to Jeremiah is recorded in 8:5-9:12. Despite covering more than one chapter, this should be seen as one unit. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:reveal]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Hyperbole ==
The author frequently uses hyperbole in this chapter to describe the complete destruction of Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
