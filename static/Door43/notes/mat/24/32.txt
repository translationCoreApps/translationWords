\v 32 Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as the branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near.
\v 33 So also, when you see all these things, you should know that he is near, at the very gates.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he is near** - Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. AT: "the time for me to come is near" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **at the very gates** - "close to the gates." Jesus uses the imagery of a king or important official getting close to the gates of a walled city. It is a metaphor meaning the time for Jesus to come is soon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
