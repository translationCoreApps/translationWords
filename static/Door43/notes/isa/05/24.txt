\q1
\v 24 Therefore as the tongue of fire devours stubble, and as the dry grass goes down in flame,
\q1 so their root will rot, and their blossom will blow away like dust.
\q1 This will happen because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of hosts, and because they have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **tongue of fire** - "flame of fire" or "flame"
  * **as the tongue of fire devours stubble, and as the dry grass goes down in flame** - These phrases mean basically the same thing. God will punish the people described in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:05:18|5:18-23]]. AT: "as a fire burns up stubble and grass" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **stubble** - "dry grain stalks." This refers to the part of the plant that is left in the field to die after the farmer collects the food.
  * **their root will rot, and their blossom will blow away like dust** - Isaiah speaks of these people as if they were a dying plant. AT: "they will die like a plant whose roots have rotted and whose blossom has dried up and blown away in the wind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
