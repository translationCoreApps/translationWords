====== 2 Samuel 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This is the finishing of a small interruption about the house of God. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:houseofgod]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

David wanted to honor God by building him a temple. God told David that he would not build it but his son would build it. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:temple]])

== Covenant of David ==
God made a covenant with David that was not conditioned upon anything David or his descendants did. God promised that one of David's descendants would rule Israel forever. Because Israel would not have a king in the future, this promise did not begin at this time. The descendant, who would rule forever, is Jesus. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]], [[:en:obe:kt:promise]] and [[:en:obe:kt:forever]])
