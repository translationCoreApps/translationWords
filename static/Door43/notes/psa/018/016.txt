===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He reached down ... he took hold ... He pulled me** - The word "He" in these verses refers to Yahweh. 
  * **surging water** - Here the Psalmist speaks of the dangers of his enemies as if they were huge waves or forceful waters, from which Yahweh has rescued him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
