===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The writer makes clear to these Jewish believers that the laws and the tabernacle of the old covenant were only pictures of the better, new covenant.

  * **Now** - This word marks a new part of the teaching.
  * **first covenant** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:08:06|8:7]].
  * **had regulations** - "had detailed instructions" or "had rules"
  * **For** - The author is continuing the discussion from [[:en:bible:notes:heb:08:06|8:7]].
  * **a tabernacle was prepared** - A tabernacle was constructed and made ready for use. This idea can be stated in active form. AT: "the Israelites prepared a tabernacle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the presence** - These objects are all accompanied by the definite article "the," because the author assumes that his readers already know about these things.
  * **bread of the presence** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "presence" is expressed as the verb "display" or "present." AT: "bread on display before God" (UDB) or "bread the priests presented to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
