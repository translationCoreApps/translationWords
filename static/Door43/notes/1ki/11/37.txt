===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Ahijah continues to tell Jeroboam what Yahweh has said.

  * **I will take you** - Here the word "I" refers to Yahweh and the word "you" refers to Jeroboam.
  * **what is right in my eyes** - The word "eyes" here is a metonym for someone's opinion or idea. This is a commonly used idiom. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:11:31|11:33]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **build you a sure house** - The clause "build a house" is a metaphor for establishing descendants from that time on. AT: "establish for you a lasting kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
