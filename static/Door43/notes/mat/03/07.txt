\v 7 After John noted that many men of the Pharisee \add religious group\add* and of the Sadducee \add religious group\add* were coming \add to him\add* to be baptized \f + \ft Or:in order that he would baptize them \f*, he said to them, "You people are \add evil like poisonous\add* snakes \f + \ft metaphor \f*! I warn you that God will some day punish \f + \ft metonymy \f* everyone who sins. And do not think that you can escape from his punishing you \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add if you do not turn from your sinful behavior\add*!\f + \ft Or: Did someone tell you that you can escape from his punishing you ( metonymy ) \add if you do not turn from your sinful behavior\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 8 Do what is appropriate [IDI] for people who have truly turned away from their sinful behavior \add before you come to me in order to be baptized\add* \f + \ft Or:\add that I baptize you\add* \f*.
\v 9 \add God promised to give Abraham many descendants. In order to fulfill that promise\add*, God\add does not need you! I\add* tell you that he can change these stones to make them descendants of Abraham. So do not start to say to yourselves, 'Since we are descendants of \add our ancestor\add* Abraham, \add God will not punish us even though we have sinned\add*.'

\v 7 But John saw that many Pharisees and Sadducees were coming for him to baptize them. He said to them, "You
people are the children of poisonous snakes! No one warned you that one day God will punish everyone who sins, did they? Do not think that you can escape from him!
\v 8 If you truly stop sinning, then do right things to show it.
\v 9 I know that God promised to be with Abraham's descendants. But do not say to yourselves, 'Since we are descendants of our ancestor Abraham, God will not punish us even though we have sinned.' No! I tell you that he can change these stones here into descendants of Abraham!

\v 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him for baptism, he said to them, "You offspring of poisonous snakes, who warned you to flee from the wrath that is coming?
\v 8 Bear fruit worthy of repentance.
\v 9 Do not think of saying among yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham even out of these stones.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - John the Baptist begins to rebuke the Pharisees and Sadducees.

  * **You offspring of poisonous snakes, who** - This is a metaphor. Here "offspring" means "having the characteristic of." Poisonous snakes are dangerous and represent evil. This can be stated as a separate sentence. AT: "You evil poisonous snakes! Who" or "You are evil like poisonous snakes! Who" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who warned you to flee from the wrath that is coming?** - John uses a question to rebuke the Pharisees and Sadducees because they were asking him to baptize them so that God would not punish them, but they did not want to stop sinning. AT: "you cannot flee from God's wrath like this." or "do not think that you can flee from God's wrath just because I baptize you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **flee from the wrath that is coming** - The word "wrath" is being used to refer to God's punishment because his wrath precedes it. AT: "run away from the punishment that is coming" or "escape because God is about to punish you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Bear fruit worthy of repentance** - The phrase "bear fruit" is a metaphor referring to a person's actions. AT: "Let your actions show that you have truly repented" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **We have Abraham for our father** - "Abraham is our ancestor" or "We are descendants of Abraham." The Jewish leaders thought that God would not punish them since they are descendants of Abraham. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **For I say to you** - This adds emphasis to what John is about to say.
  * **God is able to raise up children for Abraham even out of these stones** - "God could make physical descendants out of even these stones and give them to Abraham"
