====== Proverbs 23:6-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 If someone who is stingy \add invites you to a meal\add*,
\q1 do not eat a lot of his fine food,
\q2
\v 7 because he will be thinking about how much \add the food cost that you are eating\add*.
\q1 He will say to you, "Eat and drink all that you want!", but that is not what he will really be thinking.
\q1
\v 8 \add When you realize what he is really thinking, it will cause you to want to\add* vomit what you have eaten;
\q2 and your kind words \add telling him that you are enjoying the meal\add* will be wasted.

\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Do not eat with an evil man—he will gaze at your food for a long time—
\q2 do not desire his fine food,
\q1
\v 7 because he will be thinking about how much your food cost him,
\q2 and he will say to you, "Eat and drink,"
\q2 but that is not what he will really be thinking.
\q1
\v 8 When you realize what he is really thinking, you will want to vomit what you have eaten;
\q2 and you will have wasted all the compliments you gave about the fine meal he prepared.

\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 6 Do not eat the food of one with an evil eye—
\q and do not crave his delicacies,
\q
\v 7 for he is the kind of man who counts the price of the food.
\q "Eat and drink!" he says to you,
\q but his heart is not with you.
\q
\v 8 You will vomit up the little you have eaten
\q and you will have wasted your compliments.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These verses continue the "thirty sayings" ([[:en:bible:notes:pro:22:20|22:20]]).

  * **one with an evil eye** - Possible meanings are 1) a stingy person, one who does not like to give things to other people, or 2) an evil person (UDB).
  * **do not crave** - "do not strongly desire." See how you translated "craves" in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:21:09|21:9]].
  * **delicacies** - "special and expensive food" (UDB). Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:23:01|23:3]].
  * **his heart is not with you** - This is an idiom.  AT: "he really does not want you to enjoy the meal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **You will vomit up the little you have eaten** - This is an exaggeration. AT: "You will wish that you had not eaten anything" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **you will have wasted your compliments** - Compliments are spoken of as if they were valuable objects. The abstract noun "compliments" can be translated as a verb. AT: "he will not be happy even if you say good things about him and the food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
