===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do every year.

  * **on that day** - "on the Day of Atonement"
  * **This will be a permanent statute throughout your people's generations** - This means that they and their descendants must obey this command forever. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:03:15|3:17]].
  * **a Sabbath of solemn rest** - This is not the same as the Sabbath they observed every week on the seventh day. This was a special Sabbath on the Day of Atonement.
  * **you must humble yourselves** - In this case humbling themselves implies that they would not eat any food. This can be stated clearly. AT: "you must humble yourselves and eat nothing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the ninth day of the month** - This refers to the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar. The ninth day is near the end of September on Western calendars. This can be made explicit. AT: "the ninth day of the seventh month" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **From evening to evening** - "From sunset to sunset on the next day"
