\q
\v 5 Then she saw that although she had waited for his return, her hopes were now gone, so she took another of her cubs and raised him to become a young lion.
\q
\v 6 This young lion roamed about in the midst of lions. He was a young lion and learned to tear his victims; he devoured men.
\q
\v 7 Then he raped their widows and ruined their cities. 
\q The land and its fullness were abandoned because of the sound of his roaring.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa he raped their widows \fqa* , some ancient copies and many modern versions have \fqa he destroyed their fortresses \fqa* . \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to describe the nation of Israel as a lioness and the kings of the kingdom of Judah as her cubs.

  * **so she took another of her cubs** - Yahweh now compares Jehoiachin with a young lion cub. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **he raped their widows and ruined their cities** - These expressions are metonymy for God causing or allowing Israel's enemies to do these things. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **and its fullness** - "and everything in it"
