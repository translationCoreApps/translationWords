\v 17 \add The truth is that God\add*, our heavenly Father \f + \ft metonymy \f*, does only what is good \f + \ft doublet \f* \add for us, in order to help us become\add* all that he intends us to be. He is not like all the things \add in the sky\add* that he created to give light\add , because they\add* change\add ; that is, they do not shine the same all the time\add*. But God never changes. \add He is always good\add*.
\v 18 \add And because\add* he wanted \add to help us\add*, he gave us \add spiritual\add* life as a result of our \add trusting in his\add* true message. So now we have become the first ones of \add all the people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* that he created \add to\add* \add be totally dedicated to\f + \ft Or: completely belong to\add* \f* \add him\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Every truly good and perfect gift comes from God the Father, who is in heaven. He is the true God who gives us light. God does not change like created things change, like shadows that appear and disappear. God never changes and He is always good!
\v 18 God chose to give us spiritual life when we trusted in his true message. So now believers in Jesus have become the first people to have true spiritual life, which only Jesus can give.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above. It comes down from the Father of lights. With him there is no changing or shadow because of turning.
\v 18 God chose to give us birth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of firstfruits of all the things that he created.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Every good gift and every perfect gift** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. James uses them to emphasize that anything good that a person has comes from God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the Father of lights** - God, the creator of all the lights in the sky (sun, moon, and stars), is said to be their "Father." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **With him there is no changing or shadow because of turning** - This expression pictures God as an unchanging light, in contrast to the sun, moon, planets, and stars, which move across the sky and are always changing in their brightness. AT: "God does not change like the sun, moon, and stars, which appear and disappear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **to give us** - The word "us" refers to James and his audience. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **give us birth** - God, who brought us eternal life, is spoken of as if he had given us birth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the word of truth** - The true message of God. This is spoken of as if it were the means by which God "gave us birth."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a kind of firstfruits** - James is using the traditional Hebrew idea of first fruits as a way to describe the value of the Christian believers to God. He implies that there will be many more believers in the future. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
