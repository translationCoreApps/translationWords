====== Jeremiah 11 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 11:15-17,20-21, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The covenant ==

The covenant Yahweh made with Moses is prominent in this chapter. Because the people disobeyed this covenant, God will not help them. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]])
