====== Genesis 01:11-13 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Then God said, "I want the earth to produce plants, including plants that produce seeds and trees that will produce fruit. Each kind of tree will bear its own kind of fruit."
\v 12 Then plants grew on the earth; each kind of plant began to produce its own kind of seed.
\v 13 Then there was another evening which was followed by another morning. God called that period of time 'the third day.'

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Then God said, "I command the earth to produce many kinds of plants that reproduce themselvesâ€”plants that will produce seeds and trees that will produce fruit with their seed in it." And that is what happened.
\v 12 Then plants grew on the earth. Each kind of plant began to produce its own kind of seed, and each kind of tree produced fruit with its seed in it. God was pleased with the plants and trees.
\v 13 This was an evening and morning, the third day.

<usfm>
\v 11 God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation: plants yielding seed and fruit trees bearing fruit whose seed is in the fruit, each according to its own kind." It was so.
\v 12 The earth produced vegetation, plants producing seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit whose seed was in it, after their kind. God saw that it was good.
\v 13 This was evening and morning, the third day.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let the earth sprout vegetation** - This is a command. By commanding that vegetation should sprout on the earth, God made it sprout. AT: "Let vegetation sprout up on the earth" or "Let vegetation grow on the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_imperative]])
  * **vegetation: plants yielding seed and fruit trees bearing fruit** - "vegetation, each plant that bears seed and each tree that bears fruit" or "vegetation. Let them be plants that produce seeds and fruit trees that produce fruit." Vegetation" is used here as a general term that includes all plants and trees.
  * **plants** - These are kinds of vegetation that have soft stems, rather than woody stems.
  * **fruit trees bearing fruit whose seed is in the fruit** - "trees that bear fruit with seeds in them"
  * **each according to its own kind** - The seeds would produce plants and trees that would be like the ones they came from. In this way, the plants and trees would "reproduce themselves" (UDB).
  * **It was so** - "It happened like that" or "That is what happened." What God commanded happened just as he said it should. This phrase appears throughout the chapter and has the same meaning wherever it appears. Translate this as it is in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:06|1:7]].
  * **God saw that it was good** - Here "it" refers to the vegetation, plants, and trees. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:09|1:10]].
  * **evening and morning** - This refers to the whole day. The writer speaks of the whole day as if it were these two parts. In the Jewish culture, a day begins when the sun sets. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:03|1:5]]. (See: Merism)
  * **the third day** - This refers to the third day that the universe existed. See how you translated "the first day" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:03|1:5]] and decide if you should translate this the same way.
