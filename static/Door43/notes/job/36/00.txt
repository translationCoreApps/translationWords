====== Job 36 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Instead of being punished for his sins, Elihu challenges Job by saying that he was sinning in the midst of these difficulties. This is the last of Elihu's four statements and it is addressed first to Job's friends and then to Job. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and  [[:en:obe:kt:witness]])


Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.His attitude is not too different than Job's friends.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Yahweh's justice ==
This chapter focuses on the justice of Yahweh. It is important to remember that justice won't always come in this life. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:justice]])
