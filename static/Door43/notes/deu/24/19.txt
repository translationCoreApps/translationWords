\v 19 When you reap your harvest in your field, and if you have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you must not go back to get it; it must be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, or for the widow, so that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
\v 20 When you shake your olive tree, you must not go over the branches again; it will be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, or for the widow.
