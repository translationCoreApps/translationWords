<usfm>
\v 16 And if the people of the other nations \add whose armies have invaded Israel\add* learn the religious customs of my people, and if they learn that I \add am listening\add* when they solemnly promise that they will do something, like they taught my people to believe that \add their god\add* Baal \add was listening\add* when they made solemn promises, I will cause them to become prosperous, and they also will be my people.
\v 17 But I will expel any nation whose people refuse to obey me, and I will destroy that nation and its people. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it."

\v 16 It will come about that if those nations carefully learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name 'As Yahweh lives!' just as they have taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will be built up in the midst of my people.
\v 17 But if any do not listen, then I will uproot that nation. It will certainly be uprooted and destroyedâ€”this is Yahweh's declaration."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - God's word about Judah's neighbors.
  
  * **It will come about** - "It will happen that" 
  * **As Yahweh lives** - "as surely as Yahweh is alive." The people use this expression to show that what they say next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. Swearing in Yahweh's name instead of in Baal's name indicates that they worship Yahweh instead of Baal. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **midst** - middle
  * **they will be built up in the midst of my people** - This can be stated in active form. This speaks of the people becoming prosperous as if they were a building that was being built. AT: "I will build them up in the midst of my people" or "I will make them wealthy and they will live among my people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **I will uproot that nation. It will certainly be uprooted and destroyed** - God speaks of forcing the people to leave their land and destroying their nation as if they were plants that he was uprooting. These two sentences have the same meaning and may be combined. AT: "I will certainly and completely exile and destroy that nation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **It will certainly be uprooted and destroyed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will certainly uproot and destroy it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
