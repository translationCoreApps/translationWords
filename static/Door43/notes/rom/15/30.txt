  * **Now** - If your language has a way to show that Paul has stopped talking about the good things he is confident of ([[:en:bible:notes:rom:15:28|15:29]]) and is now starting to talk about the dangers he faces, use it here.
  * **I urge you** - "I encourage you"
  * **brothers** - Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.
  * **strive** - "work hard" or "struggle"
  * **rescued** - "saved" or "protected"
  * **and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the believers** - Here Paul expresses his desire that the believers in Jerusalem will gladly accept the money from the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
