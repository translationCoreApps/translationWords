  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues his metaphor in which he speaks of the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. This metaphor continues through [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:23:33|23:34]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **whose private parts were like those of donkeys, and whose reproductive emissions were like those of horses** - This compares the size of the mens' private parts to those of a donkey to show how wicked Oholibah's desires were. This is an exaggeration as they could not be as large as those of a donkey. AT: "whose private parts were very long, like those of a donkeys" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **whose reproductive emissions were like those of horses** - This compares the volume of the mens' emissions to those of a horse to show how wicked Oholibah's desires were.
