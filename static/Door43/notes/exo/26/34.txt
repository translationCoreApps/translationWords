  * **on the ark of the covenant decrees** - "on the chest that contains the commandments" 
  * **The table must be on the north side** - This is the table that holds the bread that represents the presence of God. This can be clearly expressed in the translation in active form. AT: "Place the table for the bread of God's presence on the north side" or "put the table for the sacred bread on the north side" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
