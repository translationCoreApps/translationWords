===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In this book, unless otherwise noted, the word "our" refers to Paul and Timothy (the one to whom this letter is written), as well as to all believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])

  * **Paul** - Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. AT: "I, Paul, wrote this letter." Also, as in the UDB, you may need to tell in this same verse to whom the letter is written.
  * **through the will of God** - "because of God's will" or "because God wanted it." Paul became an apostle because God wanted him to be an apostle and not because a human being chose him.
  * **according to** - Possible meanings are 1) "for the purpose of." This means that God appointed Paul to tell others about God's promise of life in Jesus or 2) "in keeping with." This means that just as God promises that Jesus gives life, he has made Paul an apostle.
  * **of the life that is in Christ Jesus** - Paul speaks of "the life" as if it is an object inside of Jesus. This refers to the life people receive as a result of belonging to Christ. AT: "of the life that we receive as a result of belonging to Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **beloved child** - "dear child" or "child whom I love. Timothy was converted to Christ by Paul, and so Paul considered him like his own child. AT: "who is like my beloved child" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Grace, mercy, and peace from** - "May grace, mercy, and peace be yours from" or "May you experience kindness, mercy, and peace within from"
  * **God the Father** - "God, who is our Father." This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **and Christ Jesus our Lord** - "and Christ Jesus, who is our Lord"
