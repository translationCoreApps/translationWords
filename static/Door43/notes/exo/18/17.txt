\v 17 Moses' father-in-law said to him, "What you are doing is not very good.
\v 18 You will surely wear yourselves out, you and the people who are with you. This burden is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it by yourself.
\v 19 Listen to me. I will give you advice, and God will be with you, because you are the people's representative to God, and you bring their disputes to him.
\v 20 You must teach them his statutes and laws. You must show them the way to walk and the work to do.
