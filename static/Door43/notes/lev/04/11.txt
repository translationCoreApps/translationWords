===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The skin ... the parts of the bull—he will carry all these parts outside** - The statement "he will carry all these parts" can be placed at the beginning of the sentence. AT: "The priest will carry the skin ... the parts of the bull outside"
  * **a place that they have cleansed for me** - A place being ritually pure and suitable to use for serving God is spoken of as if it were physically clean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they have cleansed for me** - Here "they" refers to the priests, and "me" refers to Yahweh.
