\v 16 They must buy them back when they are one month old. The price that they must pay \add for each one\add* is five pieces of silver. They must weigh the silver on the scales that are in the Sacred Tent.

\v 14 Every devoted thing in Israel will be yours.
\v 15 Everything that opens the womb, all the firstborn which the people offer to Yahweh, both of man and animal, will be yours. Nevertheless, the people must certainly buy back every firstborn son, and they must buy back the firstborn male of unclean animals.
\v 16 Those that are to be bought back by the people must be bought back after becoming one month old. Then the people may buy them back, for the price of five shekels, by the standard weight of the sanctuary shekel, which equals twenty gerahs.
