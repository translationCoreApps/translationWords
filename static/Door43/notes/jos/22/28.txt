====== Joshua 22:28-29 ======

<usfm>
\v 28 In the future, if your descendants say that, our descendants can say, 'Look at the altar that our ancestors made! It is exactly like Yahweh's altar \add at Shiloh\add*, but we do not burn sacrifices on it. It only shows that we are Israelites!'
\v 29 We certainly do not want to rebel against Yahweh or stop doing what he desires, by building an altar for completely burning some sacrifices and burning grain offerings and making \add other\add* sacrifices. \add We know that\add* there is only one true altar for Yahweh our God, and it is in front of the Sacred Tent \add at Shiloh\add*."

\v 28 In the future, if your descendants say that, our descendants can say, 'Look at the altar that our ancestors made! It is exactly like Yahweh's altar at Shiloh, but we do not burn sacrifices on it. It is a monument which means that we and you together worship Yahweh!'
\v 29 We certainly do not want to rebel against Yahweh or stop doing what he desires. This altar was never intended to be used for the sacrifices, for burning flour offerings or for making other sacrifices. We know that there is only one true altar for Yahweh our God and that it is in front of the sacred tent."

\v 28 So we said, 'If this should be said to us or to our descendants in time to come, we would say, "Look! This is a copy of the altar of Yahweh, which our ancestors made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you."
\v 29 May it be far from us that we should rebel against Yahweh, and today turn away from following him by building an altar for burnt offering, for grain offering, or for sacrifice, other than the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tabernacle.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The tribes of Reuben, Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh now finish their answer.

  * **If this should be said ... a witness between us and you."** - The three tribes are describing their potential answer to an accusation that might or might not be made at a future time. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **May it be far from us that we should rebel** - The unlikely chance that they would rebel is spoken of as if it is something that is a great distance away from them. AT: "We would certainly not rebel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **turn away from following him** - To stop following Yahweh is spoken of as if they were turning away from him. AT: "stop following him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
