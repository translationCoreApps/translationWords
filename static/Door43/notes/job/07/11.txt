===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul** - Job conveys a single idea using two different statements to emphasize the reason he will not remain silent. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **I will not restrain my mouth** - Here the mouth represents speech. AT: "I will not restrain my speech" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in the anguish of my spirit** - "in the distress of my spirit" or "in the torment of my suffering." The abstract noun "anguish" can be translated using the adverb "distress." AT: "while my spirit is distressed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **in the bitterness of my soul** - Here sorrow is spoken of as if it tasted bitter, and "soul" refers to the whole man. AT: "with anger and resentment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Am I the sea or a sea monster that you place a guard over me?** - Job poses this question to express his anger at God. In comparing himself to the sea or a sea monster, Job suggests that God regards him as a hideous creature. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I am not the sea or a sea monster that needs a guard to watch it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
