\v 3 But I will make the king stubborn. Because of this, even though I will do many kinds of miracles here in Egypt,
\v 4 the king will not believe what you say. Then I will punish the people of Egypt very severely, and I will lead the tribes of my Israelite people out of Egypt.
\v 5 Then, when I show my great power to the Egyptian people and bring the Israelite people out from among them, they will know that I am Yahweh, the all-powerful God."

\v 3 But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and I will display many signs of my power, many wonders, in the land of Egypt.
\v 4 But Pharaoh will not listen to you, so I will put my hand on Egypt and bring out my groups of fighting men, my people, the descendants of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of punishment.
\v 5 The Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I reach out with my hand on Egypt and bring out the Israelites from among them."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **harden Pharaoh's heart** - Here "heart" refers to Pharaoh. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart was hard. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:04:21|4:21]]. AT: "will cause Pharaoh to be stubborn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **many signs ... many wonders** - The words "signs" and "wonders" mean basically the same thing. God uses them to emphasize the greatness of what he will do in Egypt. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **put my hand on ... reach out with my hand on** - The words "my hand" represent God's great power. AT: "use my power against ... show my powerful acts against" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
