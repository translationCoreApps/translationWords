===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Be kind to those who are not certain about what teachings they should believe, and help them.
\v 23 Keep others from going into the fire of everlasting punishment. Be kind to people who sin, but be afraid to join them in those sins. Instead, hate even their clothing, because it is made dirty by their sins.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **those who doubt** - "those who do not yet believe that God is God" 
  * **snatching them out of the fire** - This is doing for others whatever needs to be done to keep them from dying without Christ and gives a picture of someone  pulling out people who fall into a fire before they burn. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **To others be merciful with fear** - "Be kind to others, but be afraid of sinning the way they did" 
  * **Hate even the garment stained by the flesh** - This hyperbole speaks of the sinners' sin as being so evil that people can become diseased by touching their clothes. AT: "treat them as though you could become guilty of sin just by touching their clothes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
