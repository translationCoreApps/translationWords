\v 14 So allow our leaders to decide for all of us what we should do. Tell everyone who has married a woman who is not Israelite to come at a time that you decide. They should come with the elders and judges from each city. If we do that, our God will stop being angry with us \add because of what we have done\add*."
\p
\v 15 Jonathan the son of Asahel, Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah, and Meshullam and Shabbethai, a descendant of Levi, were the only ones who objected to this.
