====== Job 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter begins introducing a story about a man named Job who lived during a time long before the author. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Wealth ==
Job was very rich. During his time, a man's wealth was measured by the number of animals he owned. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== Feasts ==
Job was a very godly man and celebrated Yahweh's provision by having feasts. It must be remembered that Job lived prior to the law of Moses, so his religious practices were different than the Hebrew people after Moses. The events of this book occur about the same time as the life of Abraham. Therefore, this book corresponds more with Genesis 12-50 than the rest of the Old Testament. (See:[[:en:obe:kt:godly]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]])

== Job's faith ==
Satan believed that Job's faith was based on Yahweh's blessings. He challenged Yahweh to remove these blessings from Job's life because he though that Job would no longer trust in Yahweh if this happened. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:faith]], [[:en:obe:kt:bless]], [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])
