===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize security with regard to the natural world, the homestead, and one's descendants. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 

  * **you will have a covenant with the stones in your field** - Here the stones in farmers' fields are spoken of as if they were people that someone could have a covenant with. AT: "the stones in your fields will be like people who promise that they will not make any trouble for you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **the beasts of the field** - This refers to dangerous wild animals. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **You will know that your tent is in safety** - Here "tent" represents a person's family, household, and all his possessions. AT: "You will know that your family, servants, and everything you own are safe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **you will visit your sheepfold and you will not miss anything** - "when you visit where your flock stays at night, you will find all your sheep there"
  * **your seed will be great** - Here "seed" represents a person's descendants. AT: "your descendants will be many"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your offspring will be like the grass on the ground** - Here "offspring" are spoken of as if they were as many as blades of grass, and probably as thriving, too. AT: "your descendants will be as many and as alive as the grass that grows" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
