\v 25 For I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, while Pharaoh's arms will fall. Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon; for he will attack the land of Egypt with it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information** - God continues speaking of the armies of Egypt and Babylon as if the armies were the arms of their kings. He also speaks of making the army of Babylon strong to attack others as if he had a sword and put it in the Babylonian king's hand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **For I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon** - "I will make the arms of the king of Babylon strong"
  * **while Pharaoh's arms will fall** - Here "will fall" represents being weak. AT: "but Pharaoh will not be able to use his arms" or "Pharaoh's arms will be so weak that he cannot use them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Then they** - The word "they" possibly refers to 1) "the Egyptians" or 2) "all people who hear what Yahweh has done."
  * **for he will attack the land of Egypt with it** - "and the king of Babylon will attack the land of Egypt with my sword" 
  * **scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse them through the lands** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. See how you translated similar phrases in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:12:14|12:15]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
