===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 I waited for you all to speak;
\q2 I wanted to hear the wise things that you would say.
\q2 I waited while you thought carefully about \add what would be the right things\add* to say.
\q1
\v 12 I paid attention carefully,
\q2 but surprisingly, none of you were able to prove that what Job said was wrong.

\q
\v 11 See, I waited for your words;
\q I listened to your arguments
\q while you were thinking about what to say.
\q
\v 12 Indeed, I paid attention to you,
\q but, see, there was not one of you who could convince Job
\q or who could respond to his words.

  * **I waited for your words** - The word "you" refers to Job's friends. Their "words" refers to what they would say. AT: "I waited to hear what you would say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **who could respond to his words** - Here the word "respond" does not just mean to answer, but to answer with a profitable response.
