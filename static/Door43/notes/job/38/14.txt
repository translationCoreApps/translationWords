===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 When it becomes light after the dawn,
\q2 the hills and the valleys become clear like a seal gives an image to the clay under it, or like the folds in a cloth.
\q1
\v 15 When it becomes daylight, the wicked do not have the darkness that they like;
\q2 in the daylight they no longer are able to hurt anyone.

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 The earth is changed in appearance like clay changes under a seal;

\q their uplifted arm is broken.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The earth is changed in appearance like clay changes under a seal** - At nighttime, people cannot see clearly, but in the morning the light reveals the distinct shape of everything, just like a seal creates distinct images in clay. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **all things on it stand out clearly like the folds of a piece of clothing** - Here "it" refers to the earth. This phrase has a similar meaning to the first phrase in this verse. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **From wicked people their 'light' is taken away** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The morning takes away the 'light' of wicked people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **their 'light'** - The wicked consider darkness to be their light, because they do their evil deeds in the darkness and they are familiar with the darkness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **their uplifted arm is broken** - The raised arm of the wicked represents their power and intention to do evil things, but the wicked stop doing those evil things when the morning light comes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
