\v 5 You can be sure of this: No person who is sexually immoral or who acts indecently\f + \ft Or: shamefully \f* will be among those people whom God rules over \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add in heaven\add*. Neither will those who desire more things than they need. Such people worship their possessions \add instead of worshipping God\add*.
\v 6 Do not let anyone deceive you by suggesting that \add God will really\add* not \add punish people who commit such sins\add*, because God certainly will punish \f + \ft metonymy \f* those who habitually disobey him \add by doing such things\add*.


\p
\v 7 So, do not commit the same kind of deeds that such people do,

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 You can be sure of this: No person who is sexually immoral or indecent, or who is greedy (for this is the same as worshiping idols) will be among God's people over whom Christ rules as king.
\v 6 Do not let anyone deceive you with false arguments. Because they do these sinful things, God will be angry with the people who disobey him.
\p
\v 7 So do not join with those who do these kinds of sins.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 For you can be certain that no sexually immoral, impure, or greedy person, that is, an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
\v 6 Let no one deceive you with empty words. Because of these things the anger of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.
\v 7 So do not be participants with them.
