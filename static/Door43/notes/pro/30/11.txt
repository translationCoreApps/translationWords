===== translationNotes: =====

  * **a generation that curses ... and does not bless ... a generation that is** - "a generation of people who curse ... and do not bless ... a generation of people that are"
  * **generation** - type or class or group
  * **is pure in their own eyes** - The phrase "in their own eyes" is a metonym for their opinion. AT: "believes they are pure" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they are not washed of their filth** - The words "washed" and "filth" speak of God forgiving people who sin as if he were washing physical filth off of the people. This can be translated in active form. AT: "God has not forgiven them of their sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **filth** - This should be translated with a polite term that includes human or animal vomit and waste.
