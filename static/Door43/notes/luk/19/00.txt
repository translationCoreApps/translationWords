====== Luke 19 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Luke 19:11-27 forms a single parable. This parable instructs believers how to live in light of the coming kingdom of God because they wrongly believed that the kingdom was going to appear very quickly. Although the kingdom could appear at any time, this does not mean it is going to happen today or tomorrow, just that it could. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:kingdomofgod]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Sinner" ==
The Pharisees refer to a group of people as "sinners." The Jewish leaders thought these people were sinful, but in reality the leaders were also sinful. This can be taken as irony. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])

== Stewardship ==

Although this word is not used in this chapter, it is a concept which plays a significant part of the teaching of this chapter. Stewardship is being trustworthy in the handling of the things which have been entrusted to you. God expects each person to use the gifts that he has given to them. This includes not only the natural gifts or abilities that God has given to man, but a person's life lived in expectation of eternal life. God also expects people to live in the expectation of the imminent return of Jesus.

== Colt ==

The way in which Jesus entered into Jerusalem, mounted on an animal, was similar to the way a king would have entered into a city after a great victory. It was traditional for the kings of Israel to ride on a donkey. There was also a donkey present with a colt but it is unclear which animal Jesus rode.  It is best to translate this as it appears in the ULB without trying to reconcile these two passages. (See:[[:en:bible:notes:mat:21:01|Matthew 21:1-7]])

== Spreading the garments and branches ==

This was a way to honor a king.

== "[Jesus] began to cast out those who were selling" ==
Jesus is recorded as cleaning the ungodly merchants from the temple. This event shows the authority Jesus had over the temple and the nation of Israel. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:clean]] and [[:en:obe:kt:ungodly]])
