<usfm>
\v 45 Before I finished praying, amazingly, Rebekah approached with her water jar on her shoulder. She went down to the well and got some water. I said to her, 'Please give me a drink!'
\v 46 She quickly lowered her jar and said, 'Drink some! And I will draw water for your camels, too.' So I drank some water, and she also got water for the camels.

\v 45 Even before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, 'Please give me a drink.'
\v 46 She quickly lowered her pitcher from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I will give your camels water also.' So I drank, and she watered the camels also.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Abraham's servant continues speaking to Rebekah's family.

  * **speaking in my heart** - To pray silently in one's mind is spoken of as if he were speaking in his heart. The word "heart" refers to his thoughts and his mind. AT: "praying" (UDB) or "praying quietly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **behold** - "indeed" or "suddenly." The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. 
  * **pitcher** - This is a medium-size jar made of clay used for holding and pouring liquids. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:24:12|24:14]].
  * **she went down to the spring** - The phrase "went down" is used because the spring was somewhere lower than where the servant was standing.
  * **spring** - "well"
  * **watered the camels** - "gave water to the camels"
