===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Then I saw another beast come up from the earth. It had two small horns on its head as a sheep has. But it spoke harshly as a dragon does.
\v 12 It rules people with power in order to do what the first beast wants. It forces the people who live on the earth to worship the first beast, that is, the beast that almost died but whose wound was healed.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 11 Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, and it spoke like a dragon.
\v 12 It exercised all the authority of the first beast in its presence, and it made the earth and those who live on it worship the first beastâ€”the one whose lethal wound had been healed.

  * **dragon** - This was a large, fierce reptile, like a lizard. For Jewish people, it was a symbol of evil and chaos. The dragon is also identified  as "the devil or Satan." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:12:03|12:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **the earth and those who live on it worship** - "everyone on the earth"
