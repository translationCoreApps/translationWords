\v 22 "And now I am going to Jerusalem, because the Holy Spirit has clearly shown me that I must go there, and I must obey him. I do not know what will happen to me there.
\v 23 But I do know that in each city I have visited, the Holy Spirit has told me that in Jerusalem people will put me in prison and will cause me to suffer.
\v 24 But I do not care even if people kill me, if first I am able to finish the work that the Lord Jesus has told me to do. He called me to tell people the good message that God saves us by doing for us what we do not deserve.

<usfm>
\v 22 Now look, I am going to Jerusalem, compelled by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there,
\v 23 except that the Holy Spirit warns to me in every city that chains and sufferings await me.
\v 24 But I do not consider my life is valuable to myself, if only I may finish the race and complete the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here the word "I" refers to Paul.

  * **bound in the Holy Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there** - This speaks of the Holy Spirit compelling Paul to go to Jerusalem as if the Paul were bound to the Holy Spirit like a slave.

  * **the Holy Spirit witnesses to me** - "the Holy Spirit communicates these warnings to me"
  * **chains and sufferings await me** - Here "chains" refers to Paul's being arrested and put in prison. AT: "people put me in prison and cause me to suffer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **so that I may finish my race and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus** - This speaks about Paul's "race" and "ministry" as if they are objects that Jesus gives and Paul receives.
