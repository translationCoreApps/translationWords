When they pulled the rope up again, they measured it and saw that the water was 120 ft.\f + \ft Or: 37 meters \f* deep.

\v 29 They were afraid that the \add ship\add* might go onto some rocks, so they threw out four anchors from the \add ship's\add* stern\f + \ft Or: back \f* and continued to wish\f + \ft Or: pray \f* that it would soon be dawn \add so that they could see where the ship was going\add*.

\v 27 On the fourteenth night after the storm had begun, the ship was still being blown across the Adriatic sea. About midnight, the sailors thought that the ship was getting close to land.
\v 28 So they lowered a rope to measure how deep the water was. When they pulled the rope up again, they measured it and saw that the water was forty meters deep. A little later, they measured again and found thirty meters.
\v 29 They were afraid that the ship might go onto some rocks, so they threw out four anchors from the ship's stern. Then they prayed that it would soon be dawn so that they could see where the ship was going.

\p
\v 27 When the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven this way and that in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors thought that they were approaching some land.
\v 28 They took soundings and found twenty fathoms; after a little while, they took more soundings and found fifteen fathoms.
\v 29 They were afraid that we might crash on the rocks, so they lowered four anchors from the stern and prayed that morning would come soon.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The fierce storm continues.

  * **When the fourteenth night had come** - The ordinal number "fourteenth" can be translated as "fourteen" or "14." AT: "After 14 days since the storm started, that night" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **as we were driven this way and that** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "as the wind blew us back and forth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the Adriatic Sea** - This is the sea between Italy and Greece. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **They took soundings** - "They measured the depth of the sea water" (UDB). They measured the depth of water by dropping a line with a weight tied to the end of it into the water.
  * **found twenty fathoms** - "found 20 fathoms." A "fathom" is a unit of measurement for measuring the depth of water. One fathom is about two meters. AT: "found 40 meters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **found fifteen fathoms** - "found 15 fathoms." A "fathom" is a unit of measurement for measuring the depth of water. One fathom is about two meters. AT: "found 30 meters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **anchors** - An anchor is a heavy object attached to a rope that is secured to the boat. The anchor is tossed into the water and sinks to the bottom of the sea, keeping the ship from drifting about. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:act:27:12|27:13]].
  * **from the stern** - "from the back of the ship"
