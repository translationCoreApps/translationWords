  * **General Information:** - The people of Israel continue speaking.

  * **who were never called by your name** - This can be stated in active form. "name" refers to a family relationship. AT: "who never belonged to your family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **We have become ... called by your name** - Some modern versions interpret this passage differently: "We are like the people over whom you have not ruled, like those who have not been called by your name."
