\v 20 I said to you, 'You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God is giving to us.
\v 21 Look, Yahweh your God has set the land before you; go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you; do not be afraid, neither be discouraged.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues reminding the people of Israel what the previous generation of Israelites did.

  * **Look ... your God ... before you; go up, take possession ... your fathers ... to you; do not be afraid, neither be discouraged** - Moses is speaking to the Israelites as if he were speaking to one man, so these forms should be singular, not plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]]).
  * **has set the land before you** - "is now giving this land to you." See how this is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:01:07|1:8]].
