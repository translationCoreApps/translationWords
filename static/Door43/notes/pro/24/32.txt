\v 32 When I saw that, I thought about it, and I learned this:
\q1
\v 33 \add If you spend a lot of time\add* sleeping and napping and folding your hands while you rest,
\q1
\v 34 soon you will become poor;
\q2 \add it will be as though\add* \f + \ft personification, simile \f* a bandit who had a weapon in his hand \add attacked you and stole all that you had\add*.

\v 32 When I saw that, I thought about it, and I learned this:
\q1
\v 33 A little sleep, a little nap, a little folding of the hands to rest—and while you rest,
\q1
\v 34 poverty will come to you like a thief who steals from you,
\q2 and poverty will come like an armed soldier who attacks you.

<usfm>
\q
\v 32 Then I saw and considered it;
\q I looked and received instruction.
\q
\v 33 A little sleep, a little slumber,
\q a little folding of the hands to rest—
\q
\v 34 and poverty comes marching upon you,
\q and your needs like an armed soldier.
</usfm>

  * **received instruction** - "learned a lesson"
  * **A little sleep ... to rest—and poverty comes** - You may need to fill in the omitted words. AT: "You may say to yourself, 'A little sleep ... to rest'—but then poverty will come" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **poverty comes marching upon you** - Some translations read, "poverty comes upon you like a robber." Poverty is spoken of as if it were a person or animal that can attack a lazy person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **your needs like an armed soldier** - Needs are spoken of as if they were a person who could attack the lazy person. AT: "your needs will come to you like an armed soldier" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
