===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion!** - The writer is saying that he longs for God to come from Jerusalem to help Israel. AT: "I wish that Yahweh would come from Jerusalem and rescue his people!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **then Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad** - These two phrases mean the same thing. Here both "Jacob" and "Israel" represent the people of Israel. The two phrases can be combined in the translation. AT: "then all the people of Israel will rejoice greatly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
