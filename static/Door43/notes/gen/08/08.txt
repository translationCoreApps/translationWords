\v 8 Then Noah sent out a dove to find out if the water had all receded from the surface of the ground.
\v 9 But the dove did not find any place to perch, so it flew back to Noah in the boat, because there was still water all over the surface of the earth. So Noah reached out his hand and took the dove back inside the boat.

\v 8 Then he sent out a dove to see if the waters had gone down from the surface of the earth,
\v 9 but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned to him in the ark, for the waters were still covering the whole earth. He reached out with his hand, and took and brought her into the ark with him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to rest her foot** - "to land" or "to perch." It means to land on something in order to rest from flying.
  * **her foot ... she returned ... and brought her** - The word "dove" is feminine in the author's language. You could translate these phrases with the pronouns "its ... it ... it" or "his ... he ... him," depending on how your language refers to a dove.
  * **he ... him** - If you use masculine pronouns for the word "dove," you may need to insert Noah's name here to avoid confusion: "Noah sent out a dove," "Noah stretched forth his hand," etc.
