\v 18 But what Yahweh has done to me is fair,
\q2 for I had refused to obey what he told me to do.
\q1 You people everywhere, listen to me!
\q2 Look and see that that I am suffering greatly.
\q1 My young daughters and brave sons
\q2 have been taken away to far off lands.
\q1
\v 19 I pleaded with our allies, in whom we trusted, to help,
\q2 but they all refused,
\q2 they told lies and did not keep their promises.
\q1 My priests and my leaders
\q2 died with the walls of the city
\q1 while they searched for food to eat.

<usfm>
\q
\v 18 Yahweh is righteous, for I have rebelled against his commandment.
\q Hear, all you peoples, and see my sorrow.
\q My virgins and my vigorous men have gone into captivity.
\q
\v 19 I called for my friends, but they were treacherous toward me.
\q My priests and my elders perished in the city,
\q while they sought food to restore their lives.
