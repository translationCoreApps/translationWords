== Final instructions ==
In the ancient Near East, it was common for an important leader to give instructions for his people to follow after his death. This chapter begins Moses final words to the people of Israel. Words that he wants them to remember long after he is gone. This also helped to make a smooth transition to Joshua's leadership.
