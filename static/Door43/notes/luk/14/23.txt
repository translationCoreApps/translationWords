===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus finishes his parable.

  * **the highways and hedges** - This refers to roads and paths outside of the city. AT: "the main roads and paths outside of the city"
  * **compel them to come in** - "demand that they come in"
  * **that my house may be filled** - "so that people may fill my house"
  * **For I say to you** - The word "you" is plural, so it is unclear to whom it is addressed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **those men** - The word here for "men" means "male adults" and not just people in general.
  * **who were invited** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "whom I invited" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **will taste my dinner** - "will enjoy the dinner I have prepared"
