<usfm>
\v 4 I am telling you this in order that no one may deceive you by means of arguing persuasively;

\v 4 I am telling you this in order that no one may deceive you.
\v 5 Even though I am absent from you physically, I am very much concerned about you, just as if I were indeed with you. Yet I am rejoicing because I know that you follow Christ in a way that no one can stop you, that you trust in Christ without giving up.
