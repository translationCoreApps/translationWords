===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Mephibosheth** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:04:04|4:4]].
  * **He had not dressed his feet, or trimmed his beard, or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he came home in peace** - These acts show that Mephibosheth was in mourning for David until he returned safely. AT: "He did not care for himself, and he mourned for David until David returned home safely"
  * **Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?** - Possible meanings are 1) David did not know why he did not go and wanted Mephibosheth to tell him or 2) David believes that Mephibosheth had become his enemy and is rebuking Mephibosheth. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "If you really were my friend, you would have gone with me, Mephibosheth." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
