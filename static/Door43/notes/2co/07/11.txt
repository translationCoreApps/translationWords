<usfm>
\v 11 But \add think about what happened when you read my letter\add*. God caused you to be truly sorry \add for what you had done\add*. You eagerly \add wanted to do what was right\add*, and you wanted to show \add God\add* (OR\add , me\add*) that you had done the right thing. You were angry \add about what had happened\add*, and you were worried \add that God would punish you if the situation continued\add*. You also wanted me \add to visit you to encourage and help you\add*. You wanted me to know \add that you really do accept me as your apostle, and that you punished the man who had sinned as I told you to do. By doing\add* all of those things, you have shown \add me\add* that you have done what is right in this matter.
\v 12 So, even though I wrote that \add severe\add* letter to you, I did not \add write it just\add* so that \add you would punish\add* the man who had done what was wrong. Also, I \add did not write it\add* for the benefit of the person whom \add he\add* had wronged. Instead, \add I wrote it\add* so that, when you \add read the letter\add*, God would enable you to realize how much you really do respect \add my authority\add*.

\v 11 Now think about how much good you wanted to do because you had this sorrow that God gave you: you wanted to show me you were innocent. You were so concerned about that accusation of sin, and you were so worried about how that person had sinned. You wanted justice to be done. In sum, you showed that you were innocent.
\v 12 What I wrote to you was not intended for the wrongdoer, and it was not written either for the one who suffered the wrong, but it was written for you to understand how much you are faithful to us. God knows that you are faithful to us.

\v 11 See what great determination this godly sorrow produced in you. How great was the determination in you to prove you were innocent. How great was your indignation, your fear, your longing, your zeal, and your desire to see that justice should be done! In everything you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.
\v 12 Although I wrote to you, I did not write for the sake of the wrongdoer, nor for the one who suffered the wrong. I wrote so that your earnestness for us should be made known to you in the sight of God.
