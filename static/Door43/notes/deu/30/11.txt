\v 11 The commands that I am giving to you today are not very difficult for you to obey, and they are not difficult to know.
\v 12 They are not hidden in heaven. You do not need to say, 'Who can go up to heaven for us to bring them down here to us so we can learn them?'

\v 11 For this commandment that I am commanding you today is not too hard for you, neither is it too far for you to reach.
\v 12 It is not in heaven, so that you should have to say, 'Who will go up for us to heaven and bring it down to us and make us able to hear it, so that we may do it?'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **neither is it too far for you to reach** - Moses speaks of being able to understand what a commandment requires a person to do as if it were that person being able to reach a physical object. AT: "neither is it too difficult for you to understand what Yahweh requires you to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Who will go up for us to heaven and bring it down to us and make us able to hear it, so that we may do it?** - Here Moses uses a rhetorical question to emphasize that the people of Israel think that Yahweh's commands are too difficult for them to know. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Someone must travel to heaven to learn God's commands and then return to tell us what they are so we can obey them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
