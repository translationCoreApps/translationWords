<usfm>
\q
\v 14 They wandered, blind, through the streets.
\q They were so defiled by that blood that no one was allowed to touch their clothes.
\q
\v 15 "Away! Unclean!" people cried at them. "Away! Away! Do not touch!"
\q So they wandered about; people said among the nations, "They can stay here no longer."
