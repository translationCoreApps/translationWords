====== Job 21 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. This chapter is Job's response to Zophar. It is also a response to all three of his friends in general.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Ancestor's sin ==
In the ancient Near East, it was common to believe that a person could be punished because of the sins of their fathers and ancestors. It was seen as the punishment of a god. While a father's sin may have consequences for their children, Yahweh does not punish people because of their father's sin. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:believe]], [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical questions ==
Job uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter in order to try to convince Zophar that he is wrong. These questions help to build Job's argument. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
