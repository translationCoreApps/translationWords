====== 1 Samuel 21 General Notes ======
 
=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotes, songs or poems. The ULB sets 21:11 apart because it is a song that is sung. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== David and the High Priest ==
David visited the Chief Priest, lied to him about being on a special mission for the king and asked for food, weapons and prayer. The Chief Priest gave him some sacred bread, Goliath's sword and prayed for him. 

== David and the Philistine of Gath ==
David fled to Gath. The advisers to the king told him that David was almost the King of Israel. So David was afraid of the king and pretended to be insane or mad.


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical question ==
The King of Gath's advisers use two rhetorical questions to warn him about how dangerous David could be: "Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another about him in dances, 'Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands?'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
