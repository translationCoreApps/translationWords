====== John 16 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Comforter ==
This is another name for the Holy Spirit, who is also called the "Spirit of truth." He was already present in the world, but would come in a special way, to dwell in Christians, permanently. Jesus and the Holy Spirit are both God, because of this fact, it can be said that Jesus will live in Christians after his death. This is one of the reasons why it is "better for you that I go away." (See: [[:en:obe:kt:holyspirit]])

== "The hour is coming" ==
This is a phrase that can also be translated as "the time is coming." Jesus refers to the time after his death as this coming hour. When used, it can be seen as a prophecy. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
Jesus compares his death to the pains of a woman giving birth. It is through pain that new life comes. It is doubtful that the audience would have understood the metaphor when it was spoken. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
