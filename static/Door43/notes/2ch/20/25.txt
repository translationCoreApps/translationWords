====== 2 Chronicles 20:25-26 ======

<usfm>
\v 25 So Jehoshaphat and his soldiers went to take the possessions of their enemies, and they saw that there was a lot of equipment and clothing and other valuable things; there was more than they could carry away. There were very many things, with the result that it took three days for them to collect it all.
\v 26 The following day they gathered in Beracah Valley and praised Yahweh there. That is why that valley is still called Beracah, \add which means praise\add*.

\v 25 When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take plunder from them, they found among them abundant goods, clothing, and valuable articles, which they took for themselves, more than they could carry away. It took them three days to carry off the plunder, there was so much of it.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa among them \fqb , some ancient and modern versions read \fqa cattle \fqb . Instead of \fqa clothing \fqb , some ancient and modern versions read \fqa dead bodies \fqb .\f*
\v 26 On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah. There they praised Yahweh, so the name of that place is the "Valley of Beracah" to this day.
