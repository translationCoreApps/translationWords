\v 24 But I have something good to say about the rest of you believers in the city of Thyatira. It is good that you do not accept these wrong things. It is good that you reject what those teachers call their 'secret practices' that Satan taught them. I will not burden you with any other commands.
\v 25 Just keep believing firmly in me and obey me until I come.

\v 24 But to the rest of you in Thyatira, to everyone who does not hold this teaching, and does not know what some call the deep things of Satanâ€”to you I say, 'I do not put any other burden on you .'
\v 25 In any case, you must hold on tightly until I come.
