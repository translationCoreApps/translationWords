\v 5 That is why, \add when we\f + \ft exclusive \f* teach people\add*, we do not boast about ourselves, \add as some people say that we do\add*. Instead, \add we teach you\add* that Jesus Christ is our Lord. We ourselves are \add only\add* your servants. \add We want to honor and obey\add* Jesus.
\v 6 When God \add created the world\add*, he commanded the light to shine \add where there was nothing but\add* darkness.

\v 5 We do not proclaim ourselves to you as people who can rescue you from any evil. Instead, we proclaim Christ Jesus as our Master, and we are your servants because we are joined to Jesus.
\v 6 For God is the one who said, "Light will shine out of the darkness." He has shone his light into our hearts, so that when we trust in Jesus Christ, we can learn how wonderful God is.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants** - You can supply the verb for these phrases. AT: "but we proclaim Christ Jesus as Lord, and we proclaim ourselves as your servants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **for Jesus' sake** - "because of Jesus"
  * **Light will shine out of darkness** - With this sentence, Paul refers to God creating light, as described in the book of Genesis.
  * **He has shone ... to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God** - Here the word "light" refers to the ability to understand. Just as God created light, he also creates understanding for believers. AT: "He has shone ... to enable us to understand the glory of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in our hearts** - Here the word "hearts" refers to the mind and thoughts. AT: "in our minds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the light of the knowledge of the glory of God** - "the light, which is the knowledge of the glory of God"
  * **the glory of God in the presence of Jesus Christ** - "the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." Just as God's glory shone upon Moses' face (see [[:en:bible:notes:2co:03:07|3:7]]), it also shines upon Jesus face. This means that when Paul preaches the gospel, people are able to see and understand the message about God's glory. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
