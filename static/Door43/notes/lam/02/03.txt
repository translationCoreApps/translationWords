\v 3 With fierce anger he has cut off every horn of Israel.
\q He has withdrawn his right hand from before the enemy. 
\q He has burned up Jacob like a blazing fire that devours everything around it.
\q
\v 4 Like an enemy he has bent his bow toward us, 
\q with his right is ready to shoot.
\q He has slaughtered all who had been so pleasing to him in the tent of the daughter of Zion;
\q he has poured out his wrath like fire.
