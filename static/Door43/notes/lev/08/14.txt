===== translationNotes: =====

  * **laid their hands on the head** - This is a symbolic action that identifies Aaron and his sons with the animal they are offering. In this way they are offering themselves to Yahweh through the animal. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:01:03|1:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **horns of the altar** - This refers to the corners of the altar. They are shaped like the horns of an ox. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:04:06|4:7]].
  * **set it apart for God** - "set the altar apart for God"
  * **in order to make atonement for it** - Here "atonement" means to make the altar fit for use in serving God. AT: "in order to make it a suitable place for burning sacrifices for sin"
