\v 34 Take note that this is why I will send prophets, wise men, and other men who will teach you \add my message\add*. You will kill some of them by nailing them to crosses, and you will kill some in other ways. You will whip some of them in the places where you worship and \add you will\add* chase them from city to city.
\v 35 As a result, God will consider that you are guilty for killing \f + \ft synecdoche \f* all the righteous \add people\add*, including killing \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add Adam's son\add* Abel, who was a righteous man \f + \ft synecdoche \f*, and Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, whom you \add are guilty of\add* killing \add in the holy place\add* between the Temple and the altar, and for killing \add all the prophets\add* who lived between \add the times that those two men lived\add*.
\v 36 Think about this: You people who have observed my ministry, it is you whom \add God\add* will punish \add for killing all\add* those \add prophets\add*!"

\v 34 Take note that this is why I will send prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them by nailing them to crosses, and you will kill some in other ways. You will whip some of them in the places where you worship and you will chase them from city to city.
\v 35 So God will consider that you and your ancestors are guilty for killing all the righteous people who ever lived on earth, including Adam's son Abel, who was a righteous man, and Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, whom your ancestors killed in the holy place between the temple and the altar. You also killed all the prophets who lived between the times that those two men lived.
\v 36 Think about this: You people who have observed my ministry, it is you whom God will punish for killing all those prophets!"

\v 34 Therefore, see, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; and some you will whip in your synagogues and drive them out from city to city.
\v 35 The result is that upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel, to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar.
\v 36 Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to rebuke the religious leaders because of their hypocrisy.

  * **I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes** - Sometimes the present tense is used to show that someone will do something very soon. AT: "I will send prophets, wise men, and scribes to you"
  * **upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on the earth** - The phrase "upon you will come" is an idiom that means to receive punishment. To shed blood is a metonym meaning to kill people, so "righteous blood that has been shed on the earth" represents righteous people who have been killed. AT: "God will punish you for the murders of all the righteous people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **from the blood ... to the blood** - Here the word "blood" represents a person being killed. AT: "from the murder ... to the murder" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Abel ... Zechariah** - Abel was the first victim of murder, and Zechariah was probably thought to be the last to be murdered, by Jews in the temple. These two men represent all the murdered righteous people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Zechariah** - This Zechariah was not the father of John the Baptist.
  * **whom you killed** - Jesus does not mean the people to whom he is speaking actually killed Zechariah. He means their ancestors did.
  * **Truly I say to you** - "I tell you the truth." This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
