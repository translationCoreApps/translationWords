===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is the next part of the story. As Jesus and his disciples are walking along, they come across a blind man.

  * **as Jesus passed by** - Here "Jesus" is a synecdoche for Jesus and the disciples. AT: "as Jesus and his disciples passed by" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) 
  * **who sinned, this man or his parents ... blind?** - This question reflects the ancient Jewish belief that sin caused all illnesses and other deformities. The rabbis also taught that it was possible for a baby to sin while still in the womb. AT: "Teacher, we know that sin causes a person to be blind. Whose sin caused this man to be born blind? did this man himself sin, or was it his parents who sinned?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
