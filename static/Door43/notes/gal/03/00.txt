====== Galatians 03 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Equality in Christ ==
In the church, there is equality between all members. Race, ethnic identity, sex and economic standing do not matter. All have equal standing with each other and in the eyes of God. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
Paul uses many different rhetorical questions to convince the Galatians of their sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Those who believe are sons of Abraham" ==
Scholars are divided over what this means. Some believe Christians inherit the promises of Abraham, replacing the physical descendants of Israel. Others believe Christians are those who follow in the spiritual footsteps of Abraham but they do not inherit the promises given to Abraham.  In light of Paul's other teachings, and the context here, it is probably that Paul talks about the Jewish Christians as living in equality with the Gentile Christians but this does not negate the specific future and inheritance of the physical descendants of Abraham. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
