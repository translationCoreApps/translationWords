===== translationNotes: =====

  * **tell them to keep away from the holy things** - "tell them when they should keep away from the holy things." Yahweh is about to describe situations where a priest is unclean and not allowed to touch holy things.
  * **profane my holy name** - The word "profane" here means to dishonor. The word "name" represents Yahweh's character. AT: "dishonor my reputation" or "dishonor me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **throughout your generations** - "from now on"
  * **while he is unclean** - A person who is not acceptable for God's purposes is spoken of as if the person were physically unclean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **that person must be cut off from before me** - A priest no longer being able to serve Yahweh is spoken of as if that person had been cut off from Yahweh's presence, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree. This can be translated in active form. AT: "that person will no longer be able to serve as a priest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
