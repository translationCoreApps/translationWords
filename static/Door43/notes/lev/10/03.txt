===== translationNotes: =====

  * **"This is what Yahweh was talking about when he said, 'I will reveal my holiness ... before all the people.'"** - This has a quotation within a quotation. A direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "This is what Yahweh was talking about when he said that he would reveal his holiness ... who come near him, and that he will be glorified ... people." (See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **I will reveal my holiness to those who come near me** - The phrase "those who come near me" refers to the priests that serve Yahweh. "I will show those that come near to serve me that I am holy" or "Those who come near to serve me must treat me as holy"
  * **I will be glorified before all the people** - This second part of Yahweh's statement still concerns the priest, who are the ones who come near to Yahweh. This can be translated in active form. AT: "They must glorify me before all the people" or "They must honor me in the presence of all the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Mishael ... Elzaphan ... Uzziel** - These are names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **your brothers** - This does not mean they were literal brothers. Here "brothers" means relatives or cousins.
