<usfm>
\q
\v 6 But he has made me a byword of the people;
\q they spit in my face.
\q
\v 7 My eye is also dim because of sorrow;
\q all my body parts are as thin as shadows.
\q

\q the innocent man will stir himself up against godless men.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Job continues to speak.

  * **he has made me a byword of the people** - This means that people speak of him in a mocking way and use his name as an insult. AT: "because of him, people use my name as an insult" or "because of them, people use my name as a byword" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **they spit in my face** - "people spit in my face." In this culture spitting on someone was a great insult. If spitting has a different meaning in your culture you can write this differently. AT: "people insult me greatly, by spitting in my face" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]]) 
  * **My eye is also dim because of sorrow** - Job speaks of his vision as his "eyes." AT: "My vision has become weak because I am so sad" or "I am almost blind because of my sorrow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **all my body parts are as thin as shadows** - Shadows have no thickness and are infinitely thin. That is an exaggeration of how thin Job's body parts are. AT: "all my body parts are very thin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **all my body parts** - This is a generalization used to emphasize that his whole body is thin, but refers specifically to his arms and legs. AT: "my arms and legs" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **stunned** - "shocked" or "horrified"
  * **by this** - "by what has happened to me"
  * **will stir himself up against** - This is an idiom. AT: "will be distressed because of" or "will be very angry with" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
