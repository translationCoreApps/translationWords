\v 3 That day there were four men who had leprosy\f + \ft Or: a dreaded skin disease \f* who were sitting outside the gate of Samaria \add city. They said to each other, "Why should we\add* wait here until we die?\f + \ft Or: \add It is ridiculous for us to\add* wait here until we die. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 4 If we go into the city, we will die there, because there is no food there. If we remain sitting here, we will die here. So let's go to where the army of Syria has set up their tents. If they kill us, we will die. But if they allow us to remain alive, we will not die."

\v 4 If we go into the city, we will die there, because there is no food there. If we remain sitting here, we will die here. So let us go to where the army of Aram has set up their tents. If they kill us, we will die. But if they allow us to remain alive, we will not die."

\p
\v 3 Now there were four men with leprosy right outside the city gate. They said one to another, "Why should we sit here until we die?
\v 4 If we say that we should go into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we will die there. But if we still sit here, we will still die. Now then, come, let us go to the army of the Arameans. If they keep us alive, we will live, and if they kill us, we will only die."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here the writer starts to tell a new part of the story.
  * **Why should we sit here until we die?** - Although there were four men, probably only one of them asks this question. The question is rhetorical and emphasizes that they should not do this. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "Certainly we should not sit here until we die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If they keep us alive, we will live, and if they kill us, we will only die** - The four men with leprosy are saying that the Arameans might feed them so that they can live, or they might kill them, which would be no worse since they would die anyway.
