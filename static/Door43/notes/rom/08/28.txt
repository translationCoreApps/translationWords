\v 28 And we know that to those\f + \ft Or: us \f* who love God, he works out all things that happen \add to them\f + \ft Or: us \f*\add* in a way that produces good \add spiritual\add* benefits \add for us\add*. He does this for those\f + \ft Or: us \f* whom he has chosen, because that was \f + \ft Or: was according to \f* what he planned to do.
\v 29 God knew previously \add that we would believe\add* in him \f + \ft Or: \add would be saved\add* \f*. We are those who God also decided previously would have a character like his Son's character. The result of that is that \add Christ is like\add* a firstborn\f + \ft Or: highest \f*-ranking \add son\add*, and \add those\f + \ft Or: we \f* who are God's children\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* are \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* many \add younger\add* brothers \add of Jesus\add*.
\v 30 And us who God decided previously \add that we would be like his Son\add* he also summoned. And for us whom he summoned, he also erased the record of our sins. And for us whose record of sins he has erased, he also will surely give future splendor.

\v 28 And we know that for those who love God, he works out all things that happen to them in a way that does us good. He does this for those whom he has chosen, because that was what he planned to do.
\v 29 God knew previously that we would believe in him. We are those who God also decided previously would have a character like his Son's character. The result is that Christ is God's firstborn Son, and those who are God's children are the many younger brothers of Jesus.
\v 30 And the ones God decided previously who would be like his Son, he also called them to be with him. And the ones he called to be with him, he also made them to be right with himself. And to the ones whom he has put right with himself, he also will give them honor.

\v 28 We know that for those who love God, he works all things together for good, \f + \ft Instead of \fqa he works all things together for good \fqa* , some older versions read, \fqa all things work together for good. \f* for those who are called according to his purpose.

\v 29 Because those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
\v 30 Those whom he predestined, these he also called. Those whom he called, these he also justified. Those whom he justified, these he also glorified.
