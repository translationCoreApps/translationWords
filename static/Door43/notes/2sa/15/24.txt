\v 24 Abiathar and Zadok, \add the priests\add*, were walking with them. The descendants of Levi \add who helped the priests\add* also went with them, carrying the sacred chest that contained the Ten Commandments. But they set it on the ground until all the others had left the city.
\p
\v 25 But then the king said to Zadok, "You two take the sacred chest back into the city. If Yahweh is pleased with me, he will some day allow me to return to see it and the place where it is kept.
\v 26 But if he says that he is not pleased with me, then I am willing for him to do to me whatever he thinks is good."

\v 24 Even Zadok with all the Levites, carrying the ark of the covenant of God, were present. They set the ark of God down, and then Abiathar joined them. They waited until all the people had passed by out of the city.
\v 25 The king said to Zadok, "Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Yahweh, he will bring me back here and show me again the ark and the place where he lives.
\v 26 But if he says, 'I am not pleased with you,' look, here am I, let him do to me whatever seems good to him."
