===== translationNotes: =====


  * **I will destroy his advice** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "advice" is expressed as the verb "advise."  "I, Yahweh, will confuse those who advise the king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **mediums, and spiritualists** - See how you translated similar words in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:08:19|8:19]].
  * **I will give the Egyptians into the hand of a harsh master** - Here "hand" refers to power or control. AT: "I will give the Egyptians over to the control of a harsh master" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **declaration of the Lord, Yahweh of hosts** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:24|1:24]].
