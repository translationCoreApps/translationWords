\v 5 Then to show me that I needed to be prepared to endure even greater difficulties, Yahweh said to me,
\q1 "It is as though you have become exhausted from racing against men;
\q2 so how will you be able to race against horses?
\q1 If you only prepare to run on open ground,
\q2 what will happen to you when you are running through the thick foliage near the Jordan River?
\q1
\v 6 Already your brothers and other members of your own family oppose you.
\q2 They plot against you and they say bad things about you.

\q1 do not trust them!

\q
\v 5 Yahweh said, "indeed, if you, Jeremiah, have run with foot soldiers and they have tired you out, how can you compete against horses?
\q If you fall down in the safe countryside, how will you do in the thickets along the Jordan?
\q 
\v 6 For even your brothers and your father's family have betrayed you and have loudly denounced you.
\q Do not trust in them, even if they say nice things to you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **how can you compete against horses? ... how will you do in the thickets along the Jordan?** - These two questions are intended to make statements. AT: "you will never compete well against horses ... you will fail in the thickets along the Jordan." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If you fall down in the safe countryside** - Some modern versions interpret this passage in Hebrew as "If you feel secure in the safe countryside."
  * **the safe countryside** - This refers to the open countryside, where it is easy to travel quickly, in contrast to the overgrown thickets along the Jordan River, where it is difficult to move.
  * **thickets** - many bushes or small trees growing close together
