===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh finishes describing his promises to King David through the prophet Nathan.

  * **But my covenant faithfulness will not leave him** - This can be stated in a positive form. AT: "But my covenant faithfulness will certainly remain with him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **Your house and kingdom will be confirmed forever before you. Your throne will be established forever.** - These two sentences have similar meanings and emphasize that David's dynasty will last forever. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Your house and kingdom will be confirmed** - Here the word "house" refers to David's descendants, who will rule as kings. Here "kingdom" means about the same thing as "house." This can also be stated in active form. AT: "I will confirm your house and kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
