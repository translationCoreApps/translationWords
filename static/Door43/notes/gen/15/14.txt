<usfm>
\v 14 But then I will punish the people of that country that made them become slaves, and then your descendants will leave that country, taking many possessions with them.
\v 15 But as for you, you will die \f + \ft euphemism \f* peacefully when you are very old.
\v 16 After your descendants have been slaves for 400 years, they will return here, and take control of this land and defeat the Amor people-group, because those people have not yet sinned enough to deserve to be punished now."

\v 14 But then I will punish the people of that country where they are slaves. Then your descendants will leave that country, taking many possessions with them.
\v 15 But as for you, you will die peacefully and be buried when you are very old.
\v 16 After your descendants have been slaves for four hundred years, they will come back here. They will take control of this land and defeat the Amor people. This will not happen before that time, because the Amor people have not yet sinned to the degree that I would punish them like that for it."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I will judge that nation that they will serve, and afterward they will come out with abundant possessions.
\v 15 But you will go to your fathers in peace, and you will be buried in a good old age.
\v 16 In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorites has not yet reached its limit."
