\v 28 The one who had been stealing must steal no longer. He must labor, doing useful work with his hands, so that he may have something to share with the those who are in need. 
\v 29 Do not let any filthy talk come out of your mouth. Use only words that are helpful for building others up, according to their needs, that your words would be helpful to those who hear you.
