\v 9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's palace with all the servants of his master, and he did not go down to his house.
\v 10 When they told David, "Uriah did not go down to his house," David said to Uriah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?"
\v 11 Uriah answered David, "The ark, and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my master Joab and my master's servants are camped in an open field. How then can I go into my house to eat and to drink and to sleep with my wife? As sure as you are alive, I will not do this."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **his master** - The word "his" refers to Uriah and the word "master" refers to David.
  * **Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?** - This rhetorical question is used to show David's surprise that Uriah did not visit his wife. This can be written as a statement. AT: "After coming from such a long journey, you should have gone down to your house." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Israel and Judah** - This refers to their armies. AT: "the armies of Israel and Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **How then can I go into my house ... with my wife?** - This rhetorical question is used to emphasize Uriah's refusal to visit his wife and can be translated as a statement. AT: "It would be wrong for me to go into my house ... with my wife while the other soldiers in my army are in danger." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **As sure as you are alive, I will not do this.** - Uriah swears a strong promise that he will not go home to his wife as long as the rest of the soldiers are at war. He makes this promise by comparing the truth of his promise to the certainty that the king was alive. AT: "I solemnly promise that I will not do this!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
