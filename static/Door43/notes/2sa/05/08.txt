\v 8 On that day, David said \add to his soldiers\add*, "Those who want to get rid of the Jebus people-group should go through the water tunnel \add to enter the city\add*. Then they can attack those people whom I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* detestâ€”and \add we will find out if any\add* blind and crippled people \add will be able to stop them\add*!" That is why people say, "Blind and crippled people cannot enter Yahweh's temple."
\p
\v 9 After \add David and his soldiers captured\add* the city with its strong walls around it, he lived there, and they named it 'David's City.' David \add and his soldiers\add* built the city around the fortress, starting where the \add land was filled in\f + \ft Or: terraces \f* on the east side of the hill\add*.
\v 10 David continued to become more and more powerful\f + \ft Or: influential \f*, because the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels was with\f + \ft Or: helping \f* him.

\v 8 On that day, David said to his soldiers, "Those who want to get rid of the Jebus people should go through the water tunnel to enter the city. That is where my enemies are, even my enemies who are 'crippled people and blind people'." That is why people say, "Those who are 'blind and crippled' are not allowed to go into David's palace."
\p
\v 9 After David and his soldiers captured the city with its strong walls around it, he lived there, and they named it the city of David. David and his soldiers built the city around the fortress, starting where the land was filled in on the east side of the hill.
\v 10 David continued to become more and more powerful because Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, was helping him.

\v 8 At that time David said, "Those who attack the Jebusites will have to go through the water shaft to reach the 'lame and the blind' who are David's enemies." That is why people say, "The 'blind and the lame' must not enter the palace."
\v 9 So David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David. He fortified around it, from the terrace toward the inside.
\v 10 David became very powerful because Yahweh, the God of hosts, was with him.
