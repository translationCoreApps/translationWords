====== Jeremiah 50 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 50:1-5, 6-46, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Babylon destroyed ==

Babylon will be conquered and the Jews will return to their homeland. At this time, Babylon controled almost the entire Near East. The fulfillment of this prophecy would have been unthinkable. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]] and [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===
== Israel ==
The author uses the term Israel to refer to the people group from the northern kingdom of Israel and the nation of Israel as a whole. He switches between these definitions several times without explaining telling the reader. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
