====== Zechariah 09 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is written mainly in prose about the cities and peoples around where Israel stood as a country until the exile. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 9:9-10, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Prophecies against other nations ==
The first two verses show that the prophecy concerns neighboring countries. Hamath, Damscus, Tyre and Sidon are cities in areas that were near Israel. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])
