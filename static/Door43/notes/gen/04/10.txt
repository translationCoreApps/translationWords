===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Yahweh said, "You have done a terrible deed \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! So now \add it is as though\add* your younger brother's voice is crying to me from the ground, demanding that this must be avenged.
\v 11 You have killed your younger brother, and it is as though the ground has soaked up your younger brother's blood. So now I will expel you from this land and curse your efforts to produce crops.
\v 12 You will till the ground to plant crops, but the ground will produce very few \f + \ft hyperbole \f* crops. And you will continually wander around the earth, and not have any place to live permanently."

\v 10 Yahweh said, "What you have done is terrible! Your brother's blood that has soaked into the ground convicts you of your guilt.
\v 11 You have killed your younger brother, and, now that the ground has soaked up your younger brother's blood, you are not welcome on it and your efforts to produce crops on it will fail.
\v 12 When you till the ground to plant crops, the ground will produce very little for you. You will continually wander around the earth, and not have any place to live permanently."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Yahweh said, "What have you done? Your brother's blood is calling out to me from the ground.
\v 11 Now cursed are you from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
\v 12 When you cultivate the ground, from now on it will not yield to you its strength. A fugitive and a wanderer you will be in the earth."
