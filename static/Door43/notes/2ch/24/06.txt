  * **Why have you not required the Levites ... covenant decrees?** - "You have behaved wickedly. I told you to require the Levites ... covenant decrees, but you have not done it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **for the tent of the covenant decrees** - Although it refers to the temple that Solomon built, it is a reminder that the "tent of meeting" was the first holy place for the people of God.
  * **holy things** - This refers to the items used in the temple.
