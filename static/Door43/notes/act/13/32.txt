\v 32 "Right now we are proclaiming to you this good message. We want to tell you that God has fulfilled what he promised to our Jewish ancestors!
\v 33 Now he has done this for us who are their descendants, and also for you who are not Jews, by making Jesus alive again. That is just like what David wrote in the second Psalm, when God was speaking about sending his Son,
\q 'You are my Son,
\q today I have become your Father.'
\p
\v 34 God has raised the Messiah from the dead and will never let him die again. God said to our Jewish ancestors, 'I will surely help you, as I promised David that I would do.'

<usfm>
\v 32 So we are bringing you good news about the promises made to our forefathers:
\v 33 God has kept these promises to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus back to life. This is also what was written in the second Psalm:
\q 'You are my Son, today I have become your Father.'
\v 34 Also about the fact that he raised him up from the dead ones so that his body will not return to decay, he has spoken like this: 
\q 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'
