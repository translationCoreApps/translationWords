==Â The next king ==
David did not announce who was to succeed him. Because of this, there was fighting between David's sons over who should be king. Adonijah invited guests to a banquet and declared himself king. Then those favoring Solomon told David and he declared Solomon the new king.

== Idiom ==
Several times in this chapter, the people use the idiom "sit on the thrown" to mean "be king." Solomon assures Adonijah that if he behaves himself "not a hair of his will fall to the earth" meaning, "he will not be harmed." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
