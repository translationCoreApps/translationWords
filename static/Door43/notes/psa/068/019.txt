===== translationNotes: =====

  * **daily bears our burdens** - "carry our heavy loads every day." The Lord's care for his people is spoken of as if he was physically carrying their troubles as a burden. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the God who is our salvation ... Our God is a God who saves** - These phrases mean the same thing. Here "is our salvation" can be translated with the verb "save." AT: "the God who save us ... Our God is a God who saves us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **will strike through the heads of his enemies** - God is spoken of as a warrior who will kill his enemies by striking them in their heads in order to kill them. AT: "will kill his enemies by striking them in the head" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the hairy scalps** - It seems to have been the custom for soldiers not to cut their hair during the time of war. AT: "the long-haired skulls" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
