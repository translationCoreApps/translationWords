\v 4 This is what you must say to him: 'Yahweh says this: See, what I built, I am now tearing down. What I planted, I am now pulling up. This is true over all the earth.
\v 5 But are you hoping for great things for yourself? Do not hope for that. For see, disaster is coming on all humanity—this is Yahweh's declaration—but I am giving you your life as your plunder everywhere you will go.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This is what you must say to him** - Yahweh is telling Jeremiah what to say to Baruch.
  * **what I built, I am now tearing down. What I planted, I am now pulling up** - Both of these metaphors mean the same thing. Yahweh destroying the people of the nation of Judah is spoken of as if the nation were a building he would tear down or a plant that he will pull up. AT: "this nation is like a building that I built, but I am now tearing down. It is like a plant that I planted, but I am now pulling out of the ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **This is true over all the earth** - AT: "This will happen over the entire earth"
  * **But are you hoping for great things for yourself?** - AT: "You do hope for great things for yourself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **For see** - AT: "Be aware"
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **your life as your plunder** - AT: "I will allow you to live. That will be the best you can hope for." See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **plunder** - things stolen from a place by force
