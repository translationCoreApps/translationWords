===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 When a drunk man picks up a bush full of thorns
\q2 and starts to swing it around at people,
\q2 that is as helpful as a fool reciting proverbs,
\q2 people stand back and try to get away from him.
\q1
\v 10 An archer who aims and shoots arrows at people standing around him,
\q2 is as dangerous as one who hires a fool
\q2 or he takes so little care that he hires the next person who comes along.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Like a thorn ... is a proverb in the mouth of fools** - How the two are alike can be stated clearly. AT: "A proverb in the mouth of fools is as dangerous as a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard** - Possible meanings are 1) if a drunk person holds a thornbush, a thorn will prick his hand, or 2) if a drunk person is angry, he will pick up a thornbush and swing it at people. For the second meaning, the word "thorn" represents a thornbush. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **in the mouth of fools** - "in the speech of fools" or "that fools say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
