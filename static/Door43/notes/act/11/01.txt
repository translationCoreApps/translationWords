\v 1 The apostles and other believers who lived in various towns in the province of Judea heard people say that some non-Jewish people had also believed the message of God about Jesus.
\v 2 But there were some Jewish believers in Jerusalem who wanted all followers of Christ to be circumcized. When Peter returned from Caesarea to Jerusalem, they met with him and criticized him.
\v 3 They said to him, "Not only was it wrong for you to visit in the homes of uncircumcized non-Jews, you even ate with them!"
