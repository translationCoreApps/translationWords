====== 1 Corinthians 13:1-3 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 If we could speak  \add all\add* the various languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* that people  \add in the world speak\add* and even speak  \add the language\add* that angels  \add speak\add*, if we did not love  \add others, speaking those languages\add* would be  \add as useless as beating\add* a brass gong or clanging cymbals  \add together\add*.
\v 2 If we had the ability to speak messages that come directly from God, and if we could understand the plans that he has not yet revealed  \add to others\add*, and if we could know everything  \add about everything\add*, and if we believed in God so strongly that we could  \add do impossible things like\add* causing mountains to move, if we did not love  \add others, God would consider all that\add* to be worthless.
\v 3 If we would give everything that we own to poor people, and if we would let others kill us in order that we could boast about  \add sacrificing our\add* own bodies, if we did not love  \add others\add*, we would not get any reward  \add from God\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 If I could speak so that I could amaze and persuade people to do what I wanted, or if I could speak the language of angels— but if I did not love people, all my talking would be worth less than a noisy gong or a cymbal that only clangs.
\v 2 If I could proclaim messages for God, and if I could explain secret truths about God, and if I trusted in God so much that I could move a mountain—but if I did not love people, I would be worth nothing.
\v 3 If I gave away all I own to feed the poor, or if I sacrificed myself to be burned to rescue someone else—but if I did not love people, I would gain nothing.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Suppose that I speak with the tongues of men and of angels. But if I do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
\v 2 Suppose that I have the gift of prophecy and understand all hidden truths and knowledge, and that I have all faith so as to remove mountains. But if I do not have love, I am nothing.
\v 3 And suppose that I give all I own to feed the poor, and that I give my body to be burned. But if I do not have love, I gain nothing.
\f + \ft The ULB and UDB, together with most versions, read, \fqa I give my body to be burned. \fqb Some older versions read, \fqa I give my body so that I might boast. \fqb \f*

===== translationNotes: ===== 

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Having just talked about the gifts that God gave to believers, Paul emphasizes what is more important.

  * **the tongues of ... angels** - Possible meanings are 1) Paul is exaggerating for the sake of effect and does not believe that people speak the language that angels use or 2) Paul thinks that some who speak in tongues actually speak the language that angels use. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal** - I have become like instruments that make loud, annoying sounds (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **gong** - a large, thin, round metal plate that is hit with a padded stick to make a loud sound (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **a clanging cymbal** - two thin, round metal plates that are hit together to make a loud sound (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **I give my body to be burned** - This can be made active. AT: "I allow those who persecute me to burn me to death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
