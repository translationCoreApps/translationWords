\v 5 Make models that represent the rats and the tumors that are ruining your land. Make them in order to honor the god of the Israelite people. If you do that, perhaps he will stop punishing [IDI] you, and your gods, and your land.
\v 6 Do not be \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* stubborn [IDI] like the Egyptians and their king were. \add They did not do what their god told them to do, so he punished them\add*. After their god finished punishing them very severely, they were glad to allow the Israelites to leave their country \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.

<usfm>
\v 5 Make models that represent the rats and the tumors that are ruining your land. Make them in order to honor the god of the Israelite people. If you do that, perhaps Yahweh will stop punishing you, your gods, and your land.
\v 6 Do not be stubborn as Pharaoh and the Egyptians were. Remember that Yahweh finally made them suffer more than they could bear, and that they finally allowed the Israelites to leave their land.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 So you must make models of your tumors, and models of your mice that ravage the land, and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you, from your gods, and from your land.
\v 6 Why should you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? That was when the God of Israel dealt severely with them; did not the Egyptians send away the people, and they left?
