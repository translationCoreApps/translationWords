\v 19 My fellow believers whom I love, you know that every one of you should be eager to pay attention to God's true message. You should not quickly speak your own thoughts, nor quickly get angry,
\v 20 because when we get angry we cannot do the righteous things that God wants us to do.


\p
\v 21 So stop doing all kinds of evil, and humbly accept the message that God planted in your inner beings, because he is able to save you if you accept his message.

<usfm>
\v 19 You know this, my beloved brothers: let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.
\v 20 For the anger of man does not work the righteousness of God.
\v 21 Therefore put away all sinful filth and abundance of evil. In humility receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You know this** - Possible meaning are 1) "Know this" as a command, to pay attention to what I am about to write or 2) "You know this" as a statement, that I am about to remind you of something that you already know.
  * **let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak** - People should first listen intently, and then consider carefully what they say. "Slow to speak" does not mean speaking slowly.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **slow to anger** - "not get angry easily"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the anger of man does not work the righteousness of God** - When a person gets angry, he cannot do God's work, which is righteous.
  * **put away all sinful filth and abundance of evil** - Sin and evil are spoken of here as if they were objects that could be put aside or thrown away. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **put away all sinful filth and abundance of evil** - Here the expressions "sinful filth" and "evil" share similar meanings. James uses them to emphasize how bad sin is. AT: "stop doing every kind of sinful behavior" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])

  * **In humility** - "Without pride" or "Without arrogance"

  * **receive the implanted word** - Here "word," that is, God's word, stands for the message of salvation in Christ Jesus that God speaks to believers. When they believe it, God saves them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **save your souls** - What a person is saved from can be made explicit. AT: "save you from God's judgment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
