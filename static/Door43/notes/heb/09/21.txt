\v 21 Likewise, he sprinkled that blood on the Sacred Tent and on every object that they used in working there.
\v 22 It was by sprinkling blood that they cleansed almost everything. That was what was stated in God's laws. If blood does not flow when they sacrifice an animal, God does not forgive the sins of those people.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **he sprinkled** - "Moses sprinkled"
  * **sprinkled** - Sprinkling was a symbolic action done by the priests by which they applied the benefits of the covenant to people and to objects. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:09:18|9:19]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **container** - an object that can hold something
  * **used in the service** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the priests used in their work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **almost everything is cleansed with blood** - Making something acceptable to God is spoken of as if it were cleansing that thing. This idea can be stated in active form. AT: "the priests use blood to cleanse almost everything" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **blood** - Here the animal "blood" is talking about the animal's death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness** - Here "shedding of blood" refers to something dying as a sacrifice to God. This double negative can mean that all forgiveness comes through the shedding of blood. AT: "Forgiveness only comes when something dies as a sacrifice" or "God only forgives when something dies as a sacrifice" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **forgiveness** - You can state explicitly the implied meaning. AT: "forgiveness of the sins of the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
