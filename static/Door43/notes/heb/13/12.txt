\v 12 Similarly, Jesus suffered \add and died\add* outside the gate \add of Jerusalem\add* in order that he might make \add us\add*, his people, holy by \add offering\add* his own blood \add as a sacrifice to atone for our sins\add*.
\p
\v 13 So, we must abandon \add performing Jewish\add* sacrifices and rituals \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add in order to be saved\add*, and let us go to Jesus \add to be saved\add*. As we do that, we must \add be willing to\add* let others reproach us just like people reproached him.
\v 14 Here on earth, we believers do not have a city \add such as Jerusalem where we must\add* continually \add offer sacrifices\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Instead, we are waiting for a future \add heavenly\add* city \add that will last forever\add*.

\v 12 Similarly, Jesus suffered and died outside the gates of Jerusalem in order that he might make us, his people, special for God. He did this by offering his own blood as a sacrifice for our sins.
\p
\v 13 So we must go to Jesus to be saved; we must allow others to insult us just like people insulted him.
\v 14 Here on earth, we believers do not have a city such as Jerusalem. Instead, we are waiting for the heavenly city that will last forever.

<usfm>
\v 12 So Jesus also suffered outside the city gate, in order to sanctify the people through his own blood.
\v 13 Let us therefore go to him outside the camp, bearing his shame.
\v 14 For we do not have any permanent city here. Instead, we are looking for one that is to come.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - There is a comparison here between Jesus' sacrifice and the tabernacle sacrifices of the Old Testament.

  * **So** - "In the same way" or "Because the bodies of the sacrifices were burned outside the camp" ([[:en:bible:notes:heb:13:09|13:11]])
  * **outside the city gate** - This stands for "outside the city." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Let us therefore go to him outside the camp** - Obeying Jesus is spoken of as if a person were leaving the camp to go out where Jesus is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **bearing his shame** - Disgrace is spoken of as if it were an object that had to be carried in one's hands or on one's back. AT: "while allowing others to insult us just like people insulted him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **looking for** - "waiting for" (UDB)
