===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in front of you** - "while you are present." This means that Moses was to be there with the priest when he blew the trumpets. 
  * **the leaders, the heads of the clans of Israel** These two phrases refer to the same group of people, the second phrase is used to describe the first phrase. AT: "the leaders, who are the heads of the clans of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **When you blow a loud signal** - Here the word "you" is plural. Yahweh is speaking to Moses, but he his referring to the priests. The priests will blow the trumpets, Moses will not. AT: "When they blow a loud signal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
