====== Hosea 06:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I want \add my people\add* to faithfully love me
\q2 more than \add I want them to offer\add* sacrifices to me;
\q1 \add I want them\add* to know me
\q2 more than \add I want them to\add* completely burn sacrifices \add on the altar\add*.
\q1
\v 7 But they have refused to obey my agreement like Adam did;
\q2 they have not been faithful to me.
\q1
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Yahweh says, "I want you to be faithful to me forever.
\q2 I want that more than I want you to offer me sacrifices.
\q1 I want you to know me—that is much more important to me
\q2 than when you give me offerings that the priests burn on the altar.
\q1
\v 7 But like Adam, the first man, 
\q2 the covenant that they made with me and that I, Yahweh, made with them—they broke it. 
\q2 When they did that, they were not faithful to me. 


\q1
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 6 For I desire faithfulness and not sacrifice,
\q and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
\q
\v 7 Like Adam they have broken the covenant;
\q they were unfaithful to me.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking.

  * **For I desire faithfulness and not sacrifice** - This grammatical construction in Hebrew signals here the idea of "more than," as the next line shows ("and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings"). AT: "For I desire faithfulness more than sacrifice"
  * **Like Adam** - Some modern versions translate "As at Adam." "Adam" was the name of a city in Israel.
