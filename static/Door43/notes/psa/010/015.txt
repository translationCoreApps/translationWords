  * **wicked and evil** - These words have the same meaning. You can use one word to express both concepts. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Make him account for his evil deeds** - Making someone account for his evil deeds represents punishing him. AT: "Punish him for the evil things he has done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the nations are driven out of his land** - This can be stated in active form. "Yahweh forces the people of other nations to leave his land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
