===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here Isaiah describes events that will happen in the future as if they happened in the past. This emphasizes that they certainly will happen.

  * **Who would have believed what we heard?** - What Isaiah just found out is so amazing that he wonders if the exiles will believe it. The "we" includes him and those in exile. AT: "It is hard for anyone to believe what we have heard." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **And the arm of Yahweh, to whom has it been revealed?** - Arm refers to God's power. This can be stated in active form. AT: "And Yahweh has revealed his power to people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **For he grew up before Yahweh like a sapling, and like a sprout out of parched earth** - Here "he" refers to God's servant whom Isaiah compares to a very young tree. This emphasizes that he will appear weak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
