\v 12 You whom I love, do not be surprised about the painful things that you are suffering because you belong to Christ. Those things are testing you as people test metal by putting it into a fire. Do not think that something strange is happening to you.
\v 13 Instead, rejoice that you are suffering the same kinds of things that Christ endured. Rejoice when you suffer, in order that you may also be very glad when Christ returns and shows everyone how glorious he is.
\v 14 If others insult you because you believe in Christ, God is pleased with you, because it shows that the Spirit of God, the Spirit who reveals how great God is, lives within you.

\p
\v 12 Beloved, do not regard as strange the testing in the fire that has happened to you, as if something strange were happening to you.
\v 13 Instead, however much you experience the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that you may also rejoice and be glad at the revealing of his glory.
\v 14 If you are insulted for Christ's name, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God is resting on you.
