\v 1 The angel of Yahweh went up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, "I brought you up from Egypt, and have brought you to the land I swore to give to your fathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you.
\v 2 You must make no covenant with those who live in this land. You must tear down their altars.' But you have not listened to my voice. What is this that you have done?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **angel of Yahweh** - Possible meaning are 1) "angel who represents Yahweh," or 2) "messenger who serves Yahweh," or 3) it may refer to Yahweh himself, who looked like an angel as he talked to a person. Either one of these meanings would explain the angel's use of "I" as if Yahweh himself were talking.
  * **went up from Gilgal to Bochim** - "left Gilgal and went to Bochim"
  * **Bochim** - This is what the Israelites named this place in 2:5 after the angel rebukes the people. "Bochim" means "crying." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **and said** - It is understood that the angel of Yahweh is speaking to the people of Israel. AT: "and said to the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **brought you up from Egypt** - "led you from Egypt"
  * **your fathers** - "your ancestors" or "your forefathers"
  * **break my covenant with you** - This is an idiom. AT: "fail to do what I said I would do for you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **you have not listened to my voice** - Here "voice" represents what Yahweh said. AT: "you have not obeyed my commands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **What is this that you have done?** - This question is asked to cause the people of Israel to realize they have disobeyed Yahweh and will suffer because of it. AT: "You have done a terrible thing." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
