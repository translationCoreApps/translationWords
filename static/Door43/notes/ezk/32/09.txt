<usfm>
\v 9 So I will terrify the heart of many peoples in lands that you do not know, when I bring about your collapse among the nations, among lands that you have not known.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa when I bring about your collapse among the nations \fqa* , some ancient and modern versions have \fqa when I take you into captivity among the nations \fqa* . \f*
\v 10 I will shock many peoples concerning you; their kings will shudder in horror concerning you when I swing my sword before them. Every moment each one will tremble because of you, on the day of your downfall.
