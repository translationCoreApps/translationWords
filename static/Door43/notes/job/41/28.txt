====== Job 41:28-30 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 Shooting arrows at them does not cause them to run away.
\q2 Hurling stones at them from a sling is like hurling bits of chaff at them.
\q1
\v 29 They are not afraid of clubs \add anymore than they would be afraid of men throwing\add* bits of straw at them,
\q2 and they laugh when they hear the whirl\f + \ft Or: sound \f* of javelins \add being thrown at them\add*.
\q1
\v 30 Their bellies are covered with scales that are as sharp as broken pieces of pottery.
\q2 When they drag themselves through the mud,
\q2 their bellies tear up the ground like a plow.

\q
\v 28 An arrow cannot make him flee;
\q to him sling stones become chaff.
\q
\v 29 Clubs are regarded as straw;
\q he laughs at the whirring flight of a spear.
\q
\v 30 His lower parts are like sharp pieces of broken pottery;
\q he leaves a spreading trail in the mud as if he were a threshing sledge.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to him sling stones become chaff** - Chaff cannot hurt Leviathan, and sling stones cannot hurt him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Clubs are regarded as straw** - This can be translated in active form. A club made of straw would not hurt him, and a club made of wood would not hurt him. AT: "He thinks of clubs as if they were straw" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **he laughs at the whirring flight of a spear** - The person throwing the sphere hopes that the spear will kill Leviathan, but the writer speaks as if Leviathan knows the sphere will not kill him and so laughs. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **he leaves a spreading trail in the mud as if he were a threshing sledge** - A threshing sledge goes over grain on a threshing floor and turns what it runs over to powder, and his tail leaves a trail in the mud as he wags it as he walks. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
