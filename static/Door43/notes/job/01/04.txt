<usfm>
\v 4 Each year, Job's sons made feasts \add in their houses\add* to celebrate their birthdays. Whenever each one made a feast, he would invite \add all his brothers\add* and his three sisters to come and eat together.
\v 5 When each celebration ended, Job would summon them. He would get up early in the morning and kill animals and burn them on the altar as sacrifices, one for each of his children. He said to himself, "Perhaps \add one of\add* my sons has sinned and said something evil about God in his heart."

\v 4 Job's sons often held feasts in their houses. Whenever each one made a feast, he would invite all his brothers and sisters to come and eat together.
\v 5 After each celebration, Job would summon them. He would ask Yahweh to purify them from any action they might have committed during their feasting that would make them unacceptable to him. He would get up early in the morning, kill animals, and burn them on the altar as sacrifices, one for each of his children. For Job always said, "Perhaps my children have sinned and said something evil about God in their hearts."

\v 4 On each son's assigned day, he would give a feast in his house. They would send and call for their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
\v 5 When the days of the feast were over, Job would send for them and he would consecrate them. He would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings for each of his children, for he would say, "It may be that my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." Job always did this.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **On each son's assigned day, he would give** - The word "day" perhaps refers to the day when they celebrated the son's birth. But it at least refers to the idea that the sons each took a turn in holding a feast. AT: "On each son's birthday, the son would give" or "Each son in turn would give"
  * **he would give ... They would send and call for ... Job would send ... he would consecrate ... He would rise early in the morning and offer ... he would say** - "he habitually gave ... They habitually sent and called for ... Job habitually sent ... he habitually consecrated ... He habitually rose early in the morning and offered ... he habitually said"
  * **with them** - The word "them" refers to the seven sons and the three daughters but does not include Job.
  * **When the days of the feast were over** - "When the feast was over" or "After the feast"
  * **Job would send for them** - "Job habitually sent someone to call them to come to him"
  * **he would consecrate them** - Here "consecrate" means to ask God to take away any ritual impurities that Job's children might have brought upon themselves as they happily feasted together. Job did this by making sacrifices to God for them.
  * **cursed God in their hearts** - Often such thoughts could come unintentionally, without the person wanting to think them. AT: "cursed God in their thoughts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
