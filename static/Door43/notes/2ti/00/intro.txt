====== Introduction to 2 Timothy ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of 2 Timothy ===

  - Paul greets Timothy and encourages him to endure hardship as he serves God (1:1-2:13).
  - Paul gives general instructions to Timothy (2:14â€“26).
  - Paul warns Timothy about future events and instructs him about how to carry out his service to God (3:1-4:8).
  - Paul makes personal remarks (4:9-24).


=== What is the Book of 2 Timothy about? ===

Paul, an older servant of God, gives his younger colleague, Timothy, various instructions in this letter. The topics he addresses include warnings about false teachers and about difficulties ahead. During the time that 2 Timothy was written, Paul was probably in jail, so he wished to encourage Timothy to endure hardship. This letter also shows how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches. 

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "2 Timothy" or "Second Timothy." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "Paul's Second Letter to Timothy," or "The Second Letter to Timothy." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is the soldier imagery in 2 Timothy? ===
As Paul awaits his imminent death, he often speaks of himself as a soldier of Jesus Christ. As soldiers are answerable to their leader, Christians are ultimately responsible for answering to Jesus. As "soldiers" of Christ, believers are to obey his commands, even if they should die as a result.

=== What does it mean that God inspired Scripture? ===

The teaching of this books helps the reader to understand that while each writer of Scripture has a distinct way of writing, God is the true author of Scripture. This is why it is also referred to as God's word. This doctrine has various implications. One implication is that the Bible is trustworthy and free from error. Another implication is that we can rely on God to preserve his word in this world, no matter how many of his enemies try to stamp it out. A third implication is that God's word should be translated into all the world's languages.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Singular and plural "you" ===
In this book, the word "I" refers to Paul. Also, the word "you" is almost always singular and refers to Timothy. The exception to this is 4:22. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

=== What does Paul mean by the expression "in Christ," "in the Lord," etc.? ===

Paul means to express the idea of very close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.

=== What are the major textual issues in the text of the Book of 2 Timothy? ===

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of Romans:

  * "Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher" (1:11). The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have this reading. However, some older versions read, "Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher to the Gentiles."
  * "Warn them before God" (2:14). The ULB, UDB, and many modern versions have this reading. However, other versions read, "Warn them before the Lord." Translators should consider following the same reading that other versions in their region have.
