===== translationNotes: =====

  * **After I am worn-out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?** - You may want to add "of having a baby" (UDB). Sarah used this rhetorical question because she did not believe that she could have a child. AT: "I cannot believe that I will experience the joy of having a child. My master is also too old" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **my master is old** - This means "since my husband is also old."
  * **my master** - This is a title of respect that Sarah gave to her husband Abraham.
