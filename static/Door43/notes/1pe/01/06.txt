\v 6 You rejoice because of what will happen then, but now you are grieving for a short time while you suffer many different hardships.
God is allowing you to be tested, as precious metals are tested to see if they are pure. These trials that you are experiencing are necessary.
\v 7 These hardships happen in order to prove that you really do trust in Jesus. This means more to God than all the gold in the world, which fire can destroy. Because you trust in Jesus, God will honor you very highly when Jesus Christ comes again.

\v 6 You are very glad about this, even though it is now necessary for you to feel sadness in many different troubles.
\v 7 This is for the proving of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes, even though it is tested by fire. This happens so that your faith will be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revealing of Jesus Christ.
