\v 17 Because Abraham trusted God, he was ready to kill his son Isaac as a sacrifice when God tested him. Abraham, to whom God promised to give a son, was going to sacrifice the very son whom he had given him, the only son whom his own wife had borne!
\v 18 It was about this son that God had said, "It is only from Isaac that I will consider your family to descend."
\v 19 Abraham considered that to fulfill that promise, God could make Isaac live again even if he died after Abraham had sacrificed him! The result was that when Abraham did receive Isaac back after God told him not to harm Isaac, it was as though he received him back even after he died.

\v 17 It was by faith that Abraham, when he was tested, offered Isaac. It was his only son whom he offered, he who had received the promises.
\v 18 It was Abraham to whom it had been said, "It is through Isaac that your descendants will be named."
\v 19 Abraham reasoned that God was able to raise up Isaac from the dead ones, and figuratively speaking, it was from them that he received him back.

  * **when he was tested** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "when God tested him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **to whom it had been said** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "to whom God said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **that your descendants will be named** - Here "named" means assigned or designated. This sentence can be stated in active form. AT: "that I will designate your descendants"
  * **figuratively speaking** - "in a manner of speaking." This means that what the author says next is not to be understood literally. God did not bring Isaac back from death literally. But because Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac when God stopped him, it was as if God brought him back from the dead.
  * **it was from them** - "it was from the dead ones"
  * **he received him back** - "Abraham received Isaac back"
