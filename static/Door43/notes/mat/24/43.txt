\v 43 You know that if the owners of a house knew at what time in the night thieves would come, they would be awake and prevent the thieves from breaking into their houses. Similarly I \add will come just like unexpectedly as a thief\add*.
\v 44 So you need to be ready \add for my return\add*, because \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, will return \add to the earth\add* at a time when you do not expect \add me to come\add*."

\v 43 You know that if the owner of a house knew at what time in the night thieves would come, he would be awake and prevent the thieves from breaking in. Similarly, the Son of Man will come as unexpectedly as a thief.
\v 44 So you need to be ready because the Son of Man will return to the earth at a time when you do not expect him to come."

\v 43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what time of night the thief was coming, he would have been on guard and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
\v 44 Therefore you must also be ready, for the Son of Man will come at an hour that you do not expect.
