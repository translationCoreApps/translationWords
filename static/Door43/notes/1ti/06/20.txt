<usfm>
\v 20 Timothy, faithfully proclaim the true message that Jesus has given to you. Avoid the people who want to chatter about things that are not important to God. Avoid the people who say that they have true knowledge but who say things that are against the true things we teach.
\v 21 Certain men teach these things and so they stop believing the truth. May God be kind to you all.
