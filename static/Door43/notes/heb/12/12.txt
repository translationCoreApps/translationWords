<usfm>
\v 12 So, instead of acting as though you were spiritually tired out, trust God's discipline to renew you.
\v 13 Go straight forward following Christ so that believers who are weak in trusting Christ will gain strength from you and not become crippled. Instead, they will be spiritually restored as an injured and useless limb becomes well again.

\v 13 Make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame will not be sprained but rather be healed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **strengthen your hands that hang down and your weak knees. Make straight paths for your feet** - Possibly this continues the metaphor about the race in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:12:01|12:1]]. It is in this way that the author speaks about living as Christians and helping others. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **straight paths** - Living so as to honor and please God is spoken of as if it were a straight path to follow. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **what is lame will not be sprained** - In this metaphor of running a race, "lame" represents another person in the race who is hurt and wants to quit. This, in turn, represent the Christians themselves. AT: "whoever is weak and wants to quit will not sprain his ankle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will not be sprained** - Someone who stops obeying God is spoken of as if he injured his foot or ankle on a path. This can be stated in active form. AT: "will not sprain his ankle"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **rather be healed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "instead become strong" or "instead God will heal him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
