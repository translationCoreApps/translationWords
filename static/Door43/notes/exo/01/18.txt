===== translationNotes: =====

  * **midwives** - These were women who helped a woman give birth to a baby. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:01:15|1:16]].
  * **Why have you done this, and let the baby boys live?** - Pharaoh asked this question to rebuke the midwives for allowing the male children to live. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You have disobeyed my order by not killing the male babies!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
  * **The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women** - The midwives answered wisely to appease Pharaoh's anger.
