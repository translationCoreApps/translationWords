===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek** - God speaks of destroying Amalek as if he were removing people's memory of Amalek. When a group of people is completely destroyed, there is nothing to remind people about them. AT: "I will completely destroy Amalek" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a hand was lifted up** - People would raise their hand when they made a promise or pledge, so raising the hand represents making a promise. AT: "a promise was made" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a hand was lifted up** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh lifted up his hand" or "Yahweh made a solemn promise" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **Amalek** - This refers to the Amalekites. AT: Amalekites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
