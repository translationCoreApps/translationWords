===== translationNotes: =====

  * **four people were carrying him** - "four of them were carrying him." It is likely that there were more than four people within the group that brought the man to Jesus.
  * **were bringing a paralyzed man** - "were bringing a man who was unable to walk or use his arms"
  * **could not get near him** - "could not get close to where Jesus was"
  * **they removed the roof that was above Jesus ... made an opening** - Houses where Jesus lived had flat roofs made of clay and covered with tiles. The process of making a hole in the roof can be explained more clearly or made more general so that it may be understood in your language. AT: "they removed the tiles from the part of the roof above where Jesus was. And when they had dug through the clay roof" or "they made a hole in the roof above where Jesus was, and then they lowered"
