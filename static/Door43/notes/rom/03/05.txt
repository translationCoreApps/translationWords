\v 5 So if we \add Jews'\add* being wicked \f + \ft personification \f* shows that it is right that God \add does not bless us\add*, what shall we say\f + \ft Or: conclude \f*? Shall we conclude that it is not right for God to be angry \add and punish us Jews\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*? I \add should not be saying these things\add*, \add but\add* I am speaking as ordinary humans \add speak\add*.
\v 6 We should certainly not \add conclude that God should not judge us\add*, because if God \add did not judge us Jews\add*, it would not possibly be right for him to judge \add anyone in\add* the world \f + \ft metonymy \f*!\f + \ft Or: how could he judge \add anyone in\add* the world? \f* \f + \ft metonymy, rhetorical question \f*

\v 5 So if God did not bless because we were wicked, can we say that he acted unfairly? That he was wrong to punish us out of anger? (I am speaking as ordinary humans speak.)
\v 6 We should certainly not conclude that God should not judge, because if God did not judge, it could not possibly be right for him to judge the world!

<usfm>
\v 5 But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what can we say? God is not unrighteous when he is inflicting his wrath, is he? I am speaking according to human logic.
\v 6 May it never be! For then how would God judge the world?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what can we say?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "But some men argue that when we do wrong, people can see more clearly how God does right. What can we say about that?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **God is not unrighteous when he is inflicting his wrath, is he?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "We cannot say that God is not righteous when he punishes people" or "We must still say that God is righteous, even when he punishes people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **his wrath** - Here "wrath" is a metonym for God's punishment. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I am speaking according to human logic** - Here "human logic" refers to the way humans would normally speak. AT: "I am saying here what people would normally say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **For then how would God judge the world?** - Paul uses this question to show that the arguments against the gospel are not valid, since the Jews believe that God will judge all people. AT: "We all know that God will in fact judge the world!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the world** - The "world" is a metonym for the people who live in the world. AT: "anyone in the world" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
