===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 We have spoken to you very openly and honestly, fellow believers at Corinth. We have freely shown you that we love you.
\v 12 We are not the ones holding back, but you seem to be reluctant to show that you love us.
\v 13 It would be a fair exchange—I am speaking as to children—for you to love us in return.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 11 We have spoken the whole truth to you, Corinthians, and our heart is wide open.
\v 12 Your hearts are not restrained by us, but you are restrained by your own feelings.
\v 13 Now in fair exchange—I speak as to children—open your hearts wide.
