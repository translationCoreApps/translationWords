===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man, is the house of Israel, that rebellious house, not asking, 'What are you doing?'** - God asks this rhetorical question to remind Ezekiel of something he already knew - that the people had asked him this question. AT: "Son of man, the house of Israel, that rebellious house, are asking, 'What are you doing?'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the house of Israel, that rebellious house** - This is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. Translate "rebellious house" as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:04|2:5]]. AT: "the people of Israel, that rebellious people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **What are you doing?** - Since the people had seen what Ezekiel was doing, their question implies their desire to know the reason why he was doing it. AT: "What is the meaning of the things you are doing?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **in whose midst they are** - The phrase "in whose midst" refers to Jerusalem, while "they" refers to the "house of Israel." AT: "who are in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
