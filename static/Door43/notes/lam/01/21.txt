\v 21 People have heard us while we groaned,

\q1 \add Yahweh\add*, you caused us to experience this \add disaster\add*,
\q2 and our enemies are happy to see what you have done \add to us\add*.
\q1 But cause it soon to be the time that you have promised,
\q2 when our enemies will suffer like we have suffered!

\q1
\v 22 Yahweh, see all the evil deeds that they have committed
\q2 and punish them!
\q1 \add Punish them\add* like you have punished us
\q2 for all the sins that we committed.

<usfm>
\v 21 Here my groaning!
\q2 but no one came to comfort me.
\q1 All our enemies know what happened to me;
\q2 they were all happy to hear
\q2 about what Yahweh has done to his people.
\q1 Please do soon what you have promised,
\q2 when our enemies will suffer like we have suffered!
\q1
\v 22 Yahweh, let those evils deeds come near to you
\q2 so you may see them all!
\q1 Punish them as you have punished me
\q2 for all my sins!
\q1 I suffer and groan very much,
\q2 and I faint within my inner self.

<usfm>
\q
\v 21 They have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me.
\q All my enemies have heard of my trouble and they are glad that you have done it.
\q You have brought the day you promised; now let them become like me.
\q
\v 22 Let all their wickedness come before you.
\q deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my transgressions.
\q My groans are many and my heart is faint.
