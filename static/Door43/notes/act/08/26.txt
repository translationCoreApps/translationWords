\v 26 One day an angel whom the Lord God had sent commanded Philip, "Get ready and go south along the road that extends from Jerusalem to the city of Gaza." That was a road in a desert area.
\v 27 So Philip got ready and went along that road. On the road he met a man from the land of Ethiopia. He was an important official who took care of all the funds for the queen of Ethiopia. In his language people called their queen Candace. This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship God,
\v 28 and he was returning home and was seated riding in his chariot. As he was riding, he was reading aloud in the book of the prophet Isaiah.

\v 26 Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip and said, "Arise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." (This road is in a desert.)
\v 27 He arose and went. Behold, there was a man from Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. He was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship.
\v 28 He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This begins the part of the story about Philip and the man from Ethiopia.
  * **General Information:** - Verse 27 gives background information about the man from Ethiopia. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

  * **Now** - This marks a transition in the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])
  * **Arise and go** - These verbs work together to emphasize that he should get ready to start a long journey that will take some time. AT: "Get ready to travel"
  * **goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza** - The phrase "goes down" is used here because Jerusalem is higher in elevation than Gaza.
  * **This road is in a desert** - Most scholars believe Luke added this comment to describe the area through which Philip would travel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **Behold** - The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **eunuch** - The emphasis of "eunuch" here is about the Ethiopian's being a high government official, not so much his physical state of being castrated.
  * **Candace** - This was a title for the queens of Ethiopia. It is similar to the way the word Pharaoh was used for the kings of Egypt. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **He had come to Jerusalem to worship** - This implies that he was a Gentile who believed in God and had come to worship at the Jewish temple. AT: "He had come to worship God at the temple in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **chariot** - Possibly "wagon" or "carriage" is more fitting in this context. Chariots are normally mentioned as a vehicle for war, not as a vehicle for long-distance travel. Also, people stood to ride in chariots.
  * **reading the prophet Isaiah** - This is the Old Testament book Isaiah. AT: "reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
