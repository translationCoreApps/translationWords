\v 25 The king of Israel said to some servants, "You people seize Micaiah and take him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, my son.
\v 26 You people will say to him, 'The king says: Put this man in prison and feed him with only a little bread and only a little water, until I return safely.'"
\v 27 Then Micaiah said, "If you return safely, then Yahweh has not spoken by me." And he added, "Listen to this, all you people."
