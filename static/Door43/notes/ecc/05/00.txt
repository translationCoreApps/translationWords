====== Ecclesiastes 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 5, which is an extended quotation. Some lines are indented twice to further set them apart. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Materialism ==
The author describes the pointlessness of pursuing material things. This is known as "materialism." Those who pursue after things will always want more. At the end of their life, they will not be able to use these things.
