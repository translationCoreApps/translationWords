===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my son** - Eli was not the other man's true father. Eli speaks as if he were the man's father to show the man that he is not angry but that the man needs to answer him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Israel fled from the Philistines** - This is a general statement about what happened. The rest of the man's words give details.
  * **Also, there has been ... people. Also, your two sons** - "I will now tell you something worse ... I will now tell you something worse" or "Not only has there been ... people, but your two sons"
  * **the ark of God has been taken** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Philistines have taken the ark of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
