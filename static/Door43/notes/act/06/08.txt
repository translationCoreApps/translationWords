\v 8 God was giving Stephen power to do many amazing miracles among the people that showed that the message about Jesus was true.
\v 9 However, some people opposed Stephen. They were Jews from a group that regularly met together in a synagogue that was called the Freedmen's Synagogue, and also people from the cities of Cyrene and Alexandria and from the provinces of Cilicia and Asia. They all began to argue with Stephen.
