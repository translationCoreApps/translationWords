===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **let the earth rejoice; let the many coastlands be glad** - The earth and the coastlands are said to have emotions like people. AT: "Rejoice and be glad every person on the earth and near the seas" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **coastlands** - Possible meanings are 1) "lands near the seas" or 2) "islands."
  * **Clouds and darkness surround him** - "We cannot see him; it is as if he were sitting in the dark with clouds all around him"
  * **Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne** - The word "throne" is a metonym for the deeds and words of the one who sits on it. The psalmist speaks as if righteousness and justice were physical objects that made the throne secure. AT: "He is righteous and just in everything he does" or "He is able to rule because he rules righteously and justly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the foundation of his throne** - Here "the foundation of his throne"â€‹ refers to how Yahweh rules his kingdom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
