=== What is the Book of Job about? ===

The Book of Job presents a situation in which disaster came to Job, even though he was faithful to Yahweh. The book asks why God permits trials and losses to come into the lives of those who worship him. The book explains that when this happens, it is more important to trust God and to find peace in him than it is to understand the reason for the suffering.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

The Book of Job is named for Job, the main character in the book. His name is not related to the English word "job." Translators might choose to make the title clearer, for example, "The book about Job."

=== Who wrote the Book of Job? ===

The author of the Book of Job is not known. Many suggest that Moses composed or compiled the book, but this is uncertain.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Does sin cause suffering? ===

Although sin causes suffering, this does not mean that sin causes all suffering. It was generally believed in the Ancient Near East that a person suffered because of certain sins in his life or in the lives of his parents or ancestors. This is, in fact, what many religions teach. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== When did the events presented in the Book of Job take place? ===

The story about Job is set in the time of the patriarchs—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Very little is known for certain about the religious and cultural context of the book. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What style of writing is in the Book of Job? ===

The beginning and end of the Book of Job are mostly narrative, forming the introduction and conclusion. However, most of the book is poetry. This is well-suited to the lessons in the book, which apply equally well to people living in any time period.There are many examples of this philosophical kind of poetry from the ancient Near East. 

=== How do I translate the term "friends?" ===

While the ULB uses the term "friends" in reference to Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, this word is somewhat misleading. Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar were not really Job's friends. Instead, they tried to persuade Job to say something about God that he believed was false. 

=== Is the Book of Job difficult to translate? ===

Because Job is not connected with a specific historical context, the translator may wish to translate this book before other Old Testament books. On the other hand, the book of Job has many unique words and phrases, which make parts difficult to understand. The translator should be aware that this causes the book to be hard to translate. For this reason, translators may decide not to attempt to translate this book until they have gained much experience translating other portions of the Bible.
