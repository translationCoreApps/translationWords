<usfm>
\v 24 When Rebekah gave birth, it was true! Twin boys were born!
\v 25 The first one born was red, and his body had hair all over it, like a garment made of hair. So they named him Esau, which sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'hairy.'
\v 26 Then his brother was born, grasping Esau's heel. So they named him Jacob, which sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'heel.' Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born.
