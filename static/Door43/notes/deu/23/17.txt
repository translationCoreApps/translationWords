\v 17 There must be no cultic prostitute among any of the daughters of Israel, neither must there be a cultic prostitute among the sons of Israel.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **cultic prostitute ... cultic prostitute ... prostitute ... dog** - Yahweh gives a complete list of both forms of prostitution by both men and women to forbid prostitution by anyone for any reason. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **cultic prostitute ... among any of the daughters ... among the sons** - Possible meanings are that Moses 1) openly forbids women and men to perform sexual acts as part of temple service or 2) uses a euphemism to forbid women and men to perform sexual acts to receive money. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **You must not bring the wages of a prostitute ... into the house** - "A woman who earns money as a prostitute must not bring that money ... into the house"
  * **a dog** - a man who allows men to have sex with him for money 
  * **into the house of Yahweh your God** - "into the temple"
  * **for any vow** - "to fulfill a vow"
