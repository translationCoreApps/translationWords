\v 8 Look, the money that we found in our sacks' openings, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then could we steal out of your master's house silver or gold?
\v 9 With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my master's slaves."
\v 10 The steward said, "Now also let it be according to your words. He with whom the cup is found will be my slave, and you others will be innocent."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Look** - This adds emphasis to what the brothers say next.
  * **the money that we found in our sacks' openings** - "you know the money that we found in our sacks"
  * **we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan** - "we brought back to you from Canaan"
  * **How then could we steal out of your master's house silver or gold?** - The brothers use a question to emphasize that they would not steal from the lord of Egypt. AT: "So we would never take anything from your master's house!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **silver or gold** - These words are used together to mean that they would not steal anything of any value.
  * **With whomever of your servants it is found** - The brothers refer to themselves as "your servants." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with greater authority. It can be stated in the first person. Also, "is is found" can be stated in active form. AT: "If you find that one of us has stolen the cup" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **we also will be my master's slaves** - The phrase "my master" refers to the steward. This can be stated in the second person. AT: "you may take us as your slaves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Now also let it be according to your words** - Here "now" does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows. Also, "words" stands for what was said. AT: "Very well. I will do what you said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He with whom the cup is found will be my slave** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "If I find the cup in one of your sacks, that person will be my slave" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
