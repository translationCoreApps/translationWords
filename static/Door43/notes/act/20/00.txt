====== Acts 20 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter functions as a way for Paul to say goodbye to the people of Ephesus. He gives them instructions, since they will never see him again.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Race ==
Paul uses the image of a "race" for the Christian life. This is not to say that the Christian life is about winning or coming in first place. Instead, it is a long race that requires discipline and perseverance. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:discipline]])

== The leading of the Holy Spirit ==
Christians are to follow the leadership and guidance of the Holy Spirit in their lives.
