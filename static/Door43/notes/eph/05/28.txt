====== Ephesians 05:28-30 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 In the same way, each man should love his wife as he loves his own body. Men who love their wives, \add it is as though\add* they love themselves.
\v 29-30 This is shown by the fact that no one ever hated his own body. Instead, he feeds his own body and cares for it, just like Christ also cares for all us believers. We have become one group of believers that belongs to him \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 Each man should love his wife as he loves his own body. When men love their wives, it is as though they loved themselves,
\v 29-30 because no one ever hated his own body. Instead, he feeds his own body and cares for it, just like Christ also cares for all us believers in his worldwide assembly. We have become one group of believers that belongs to him.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 In the same way husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.
\v 29 For no one ever hated his own body, but nourishes and treats it with care, just as Christ nourishes and treats the church with care,
\v 30 because we are members of his body.
