\v 19 Later all those young women were gathered together again. By that time Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, where the elders and leaders would hold court and settle disputes for others in the kingdom.
\v 20 But Esther still did not tell anyone about her family, or about her people, the Jews. She continued to do what Mordecai had told her to do; she continued to respect him and honor him by doing what he said.
\v 21 One day when Mordecai was at the king's gate, two of the king's officials were there. Their names were Bigthana and Teresh. They were the guards who protected the king, standing just outside the king's own rooms. They became angry with the king, and they were planning how they could do him great harm.

\v 19 Now when the virgins had been gathered together a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.
\v 20 Esther had not yet told anyone about her relatives or her people, as Mordecai had instructed her. She continued to follow Mordecai's advice, as she had done when she was raised by him.
\v 21 In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, two of the king's officials, Bigthan and Teresh, who guarded the doorway, became angry and sought to do harm to King Ahasuerus.
