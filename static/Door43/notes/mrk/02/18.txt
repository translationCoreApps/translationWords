\v 18 The disciples of John \add the Baptizer\add* and some men who belonged to the Pharisee \add sect\add* used to abstain from food \add to show that they wanted to please God\add*.

\v 19 \add Jesus wanted them to understand that it was not appropriate for his disciples to show sorrow by abstaining from food while he was still with them\add*. So he said to them, "When a man is marrying a woman, his friends will certainly not abstain from food while he is still with them, will they \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? No. During the time that he is with them, they will not abstain from food \add because they are happy together\add*.

\v 18 Now at this time, the disciples of John the Baptizer and some men who belonged to the Pharisee sect were abstaining from food, as they often did. Some men came to Jesus and asked him, "The disciples of John and the Pharisees often abstain from food. Why do your disciples not abstain from food?"
\v 19 Jesus said to them, "When a man is marrying a woman, his friends will certainly not abstain from food while he is still with them. The wedding is a time of feasting and celebrating with the groom. It is not a time for abstaining from food, especially while the groom is with them.

\v 18 John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And some people came and said to him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
\v 19 Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding attendants fast while the bridegroom is still with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus tells parables to show why his disciples should not fast while he is with them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **some people** - "some men." It is best to translate this phrase without specifying exactly who these men are. If in your language you have to be more specific, the possible meanings are 1) these men were not among John's disciples or the disciples of the Pharisees or 2) these men were among John's disciples. 
  * **the Pharisees were fasting ... the disciples of the Pharisees** - These two phrases refer to the same group of people. The second phrase is a more specific phrase. Both refer to the people who are followers of the Pharisee sect, but it does not necessarily refer to the leaders of the Pharisees. "the disciples of the Pharisees ... the disciples of the Pharisees"
  * **but your disciples do not fast** - Fasting means not eating. In cultures where fasting is not practiced, it may be more natural to use a positive statement. AT: "but your disciples continue to eat regularly"
  * **Can the wedding attendants fast while the bridegroom is still with them?** - Jesus asks this question to make a comparison between himself and his disciples and a bridegroom and his friends. This question can be written as a statement. AT: "My disciples celebrate while I am here with them!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
