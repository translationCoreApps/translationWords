  * **Who is the one who will harm you if you desire what is good?** - Peter asks this question to emphasize that it is unlikely that someone would harm them if they do good things. AT: "No one will harm you if you do good things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

  * **you are blessed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will bless you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Do not fear what they fear. Do not be troubled** - These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that believers should not be afraid of those who persecute them. AT: "Do not be afraid of what people might do to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **what they fear** - Here the word "they" refers to anyone who might try to harm those to whom Peter is writing.
