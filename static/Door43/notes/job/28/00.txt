== Yahweh's wisdom ==

Despite being upset about his circumstances, Job does not curse God. Instead, he recognizes Yahweh's wisdom and authority. This chapter especially focus on Yahweh's wisdom as he controls the circumstances of Job's life. Man cannot understand because they do not have Yahweh's wisdom. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:curse]] and [[:en:obe:kt:wise]])
