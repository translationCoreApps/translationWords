  * **Why is light given to him who is in misery?** - Here Job is wondering why people must stay alive and suffer. AT: "I do not understand why God gives life to a person who is suffering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

  * **Why is light given to one who rejoices very much and is glad when he finds the grave** - Here Job uses a question to make a statement.
