\v 3 His mother and father objected very strongly. They said, "Is there no woman from our tribe, or from the other Israelite tribes, that you could marry? Why must you go to the heathen Philistines to get a wife?"
\p But Samson told his father, "Get her for me! She is the one I want!"
\v 4 His mother and father did not realize that Yahweh was arranging this. He was preparing a way for \add Samson to defeat\add* the Philistines, who were ruling over Israel at that time.

\v 3 His mother and father objected very strongly. They said, "Is there no woman from our tribe, or from the other Israelite tribes, that you could marry? Why do you want a wife from the Philistines, who are not circumcised and do not worship Yahweh?"
\p But Samson told his father, "Get her for me! She is the one I want!"
\v 4 His mother and father did not realize that Yahweh was arranging this. He was preparing a way for Samson to create a conflict with the Philistines, for they were ruling over Israel at that time.

\v 3 His father and mother said to him, "Is there not a woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people? Are you going to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?" Samson said to his father, "Get her for me, for when I look at her, she pleases me."
\v 4 But his father and his mother did not know that this matter came from Yahweh, for he desired to create a conflict with the Philistines (for at that time the Philistines were ruling Israel).

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Is there not a woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people?** - They ask this question to suggest that they could find Samson a wife among their own people. This question can be written as a statement. AT: "Surely there are women among your people whom you could marry." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the daughters of your relatives** - The word "daughter" is a polite way to refer to a young, unmarried woman. AT: "one of the unmarried women among your relatives" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **Are you going to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?** - This question is asked to rebuke Samson. This question can be written as a statement. You can make explicit the reason his parents do not want him to marry a Philistine. AT: "You really should not marry a Philistine woman because the Philistine people do not worship Yahweh." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Get her for me** - This is an idiom. Samson was demanding his parents to speak to the Philistine woman's parents about marriage. AT: "Now arrange for her to be my wife" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **she pleases me** - This means that Samson thinks she is beautiful. "I am pleased by how beautiful she is" or "she is beautiful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **this matter** - This refers to Samson's request to marry the Philistine woman.
  * **for he desired to create a conflict** - The word "he" refers to Yahweh.
