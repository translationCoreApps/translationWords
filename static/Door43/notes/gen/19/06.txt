<usfm>
\v 6 Lot went outside the house and shut the door behind him, so that they could not go inside.
\v 7 He said to them, "My friends, don't do such an evil thing!
\v 8 Listen to me. I have two daughters who have never had sex with any man. Let me bring them out to you now, and you can do with them whatever pleases you. But don't do anything to these men, because they are guests in my house, so I must protect them!"

\v 6 So Lot went out the door to them and shut the door after himself.
\v 7 He said, "I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.
\v 8 Look, I have two daughters who have not slept with any man. Let me, I beg you, bring them out to you, and you do to them whatever is good in your eyes. Only do nothing to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof."
