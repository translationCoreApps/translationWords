\v 17 Now I have something to say to anyone of you Jews to whom I am writing: You trust that God will save you because you know the laws that he gave to Moses. You boast that you belong to God.
\v 18 You know what God desires. Because you have been taught God's laws, you are able to know which things are right and to choose to do them.
\v 19 You are certain that you are able to show God's truth to non-Jews, and that you can instruct those who know nothing about God.
\v 20 You are certain that you can instruct those who believe foolish things about God and those who are like children because they know nothing about him at all. You are certain about all this because you have the law that teaches you truly about God.

\p
\v 17 Suppose that you call yourself a Jew, rest upon the law, rejoice proudly in God, 
\v 18 know his will, and test the things that differ from it, having been instructed by the law. 
\v 19 And suppose that you are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, 
\v 20 a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, and that you have in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here begins Paul's discussion that the law the Jews possess actually condemns them because they do not obey it. 

  * **Suppose that you call yourself a Jew** - Here Paul speaks as if he were addressing only one person. What is true for one is true for all people. "Now you think of yourself as a member of the Jewish people"
  * **rest upon the law, rejoice proudly in God** - The phrase "rest upon the law" is an idiom. Paul speaks of relying on the law as if one could actually lean on it for support. AT: "and you rely on the law of Moses and rejoice proudly because of God"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **know his will** - "and you know God's will"
  * **having been instructed by the law** - "because you have learned what the law of Moses teaches"
  * **And suppose that you are confident ... and of the truth** - If your language has a way to mark that 2:19-20 interrupts Paul's main argument of [[:en:bible:notes:rom:02:17|17, 18]] and [[:en:bible:notes:rom:02:21|21]], you can use it here. You might have to place 2:19-20 before 2:17.
  * **that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness** - Here "a guide of the blind" and "a light" are metaphors for ways of helping a person who cannot see. These two phrases have very similar meanings. Using them, Paul compares a Jewish person teaching someone about the law to helping a person that cannot see. AT: "that you yourself are like a guide to someone who is blind, and you are like a light to someone who is lost in the dark" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a corrector of the foolish** - "you correct those who do wrong"
  * **a teacher of babies** - Here Paul compares those who do not know anything about the law to babies. AT: "and you teach those who do not know the law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and that you have in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth** - The knowledge of the truth that is in the law comes from God. AT: "because you are sure you understand the truth that God has given in the law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
