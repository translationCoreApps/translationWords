  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

  * **you went down to Sheol** - The people did not literally go to Sheol, the world of the dead. Instead, Yahweh is indicating that the people were willing to go anywhere to find new gods to worship. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
