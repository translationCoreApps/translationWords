\v 8 You must bring the grain offering made from these things to Yahweh, and it will be presented to the priest, who will bring it to the altar.
\v 9 Then the priest will take some from the grain offering as a representative offering, and he will burn it on the altar. It will be an offering made by fire, and it will produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh.
\v 10 What is left of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is very holy to Yahweh from the offerings to Yahweh made by fire.
