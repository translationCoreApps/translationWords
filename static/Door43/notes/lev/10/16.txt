\v 16 When Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* inquired about the goat that had been sacrificed to cause the people to become acceptable to Yahweh, he\f + \ft Or: I \f* found out that it had been completely burned. So he\f + \ft Or: I \f* was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar and asked them,
\v 17 "Why did you not eat near the Sacred Tent the meat of the sin offering? It was very holy, and it was given to you to enable the Israelite people to no longer be guilty for their sins and to be forgiven for their sins.
\v 18 Since its blood was not taken into the holy place inside the Sacred Tent, you should have eaten the \add meat of\add* the goat outside the Sacred Tent, as I commanded."

\v 16 When Moses inquired about the goat that the priests had sacrificed for the people's sins, he found out that the priests had burned it all. So he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar and asked them,
\v 17 "Why did you not eat near the sacred tent the meat of the sin offering? It was very special for Yahweh; he gave it to you so he could forgive the sins of the people.
\v 18 Since its blood was not taken into the holy place inside the sacred tent, you should have eaten the meat of the goat outside the sacred tent, as I commanded."

\v 16 Then Moses asked about the goat for the sin offering, and found that it was burned up. So he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the remaining sons of Aaron; he said,
\v 17 "Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the area of the tabernacle, since it is most holy, and since Yahweh has given it to you to take away the iniquity of the assembly, to make atonement for them before him?
\v 18 Look, its blood was not brought inside the tabernacle, so you should certainly have eaten it in the tabernacle area, as I commanded."

  * **since it is most holy** - "since the sin offering is most holy"
  * **to take away the iniquity of the assembly** - Causing Yahweh to forgive the people of Israel is spoken of as if iniquity were an object that Yahweh takes from the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
