\v 3 You had thrown me into the depths, into the heart of the seas,
\q and the currents surrounded me;
\q all your waves and billows

\q yet I will again look toward your holy temple.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [[:en:bible:notes:jon:02:01|2:2]]. In verse 4 Jonah spoke of something he had prayed before this prayer.

  * **into the depths, into the heart of the seas** - This speaks of the vastness of the ocean Jonah was in. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **into the heart of the seas** - "to the bottom of the sea"
  * **the currents surrounded me** - "the sea water closed in around me"
  * **waves and billows** - These are characteristics of the surface of the ocean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **I am driven out** - This can be stayed in active form. AT: "You have driven me away" or "You have sent me away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from before your eyes** - "from you." When Jonah said "your eyes" he was speaking about Yahweh in his entirety. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **yet I will again look toward your holy temple** - Jonah has hope that, in spite of all he is going through, he will see the temple (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
