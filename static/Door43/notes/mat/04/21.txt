===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus calls more men to be his disciples.

  * **He called them** - "Jesus called John and James." This phrase also means that Jesus invited them to follow him, live with him, and become his disciples.
  * **immediately** - "at that moment"
  * **left the boat ... and followed him** - It should be clear that this is a life change. These men are no longer going to be fishermen and are leaving the family business to follow Jesus for the rest of their lives.
