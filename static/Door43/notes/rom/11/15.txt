\v 15 God has rejected most of my fellow Jews because they refused to believe, with the result that he made peace between himself and other people in the world. If that is what happened after most of the Jews rejected Christ, think about the excellent things that will happen after they trust in him. It will be like they have risen from the realm of the dead!
\v 16 Just like the whole lump of dough will belong to God if people offer to God the bread baked from the first part of it, so the Jews will belong to God because their ancestors belonged to God. And just like the branches of a tree will belong to God if the root belongs to God, so the descendants of our great Jewish ancestors who belonged to God will also some day belong to God.

\v 15 For if the rejection of those is the reconciliation of the world, what will their reception be but life from the dead ones?
\v 16 If the firstfruits are reserved, so is the lump of dough. If the root is reserved, so are the branches.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **those** - This pronoun refers to Jewish unbelievers.
  * **the world** - Here "the world" is a metonym for the people who live in the world. AT: "the people in the world" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **what will their reception be but life from the dead?** - Paul asks this question to add emphasis. You can translate it in an active form. AT: "how will God receive them when they believe in Christ? It will be like they have come back to life from the dead!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If the firstfruits are reserved, so is the lump of dough** - Paul is speaking of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the Israelites' ancestors, as if they were the first grain or "firstfruits" to be harvested. He is also speaking of the Israelites who are descendants of those men as if they were a "lump of dough" that they made from the grain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **If the root is reserved, so are the branches** - Paul is speaking of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the Israelites' ancestors, as if they were the root of a tree, and the Israelites who are descendants of those men, as if they were the tree's "branches." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **reserved** - The people always dedicated to God the first crops that they harvested. Here "firstfruits" stands for the first people to believe in Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
