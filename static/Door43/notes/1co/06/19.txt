===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do you not know ... God? ... that you are not your own?** - Paul is continuing to teach the Corinthians by emphasizing what they already know. AT: "I want to remind you ... God and that you are not your own." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **your body** - the body of each individual Christian is a temple of the Holy Spirit
  * **temple of the Holy Spirit** - A temple is dedicated to divine beings, and it is also where they dwell. In the same way, each Corinthian believer's body is like a temple because the Holy Spirit is present within them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For you were bought with a price** - God paid for the freedom of the Corinthians from the slavery of sin. This can be stated as active. AT: "God paid for your freedom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Therefore** - "Because this is true"
