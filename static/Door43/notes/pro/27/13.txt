  * **Take a garment of one who has put up security for a stranger** - When lending money, a lender would take something from the borrower, such as a garment, as a guarantee of repayment. He would return it after the money was repaid. If the borrower was too poor, someone else could give something to the lender as a guarantee for him. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:20:15|20:16]].
