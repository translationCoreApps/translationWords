===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues his metaphor in which he speaks of the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. This metaphor continues through [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:23:33|23:34]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow** - This speaks of being very drunk and sorrowful as if drunkenness and sorrow were things that filled his body. AT: "You will become very drunk and very sad" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the cup of horror and devastation** - "the cup that causes horror and devastation" The words "horror" and "devastation" share similar meanings here and emphasize how terrible her punishment will be. AT: "for what is in that cup causes horror and devastation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the cup of your sister Samaria** - Oholibah's sister Oholah represents Samaria. Samaria is called by it's name but still referred to as a sister. The cup is a symbol for the punishment that she received. AT: "for this is the same cup of punishment that you sister drank, who represents Samaria"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **tear your breasts** - "cut your beasts" (UDB)
