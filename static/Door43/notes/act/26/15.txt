\v 15 Then I asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' The Lord said to me, 'I am Jesus. You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are harming me \add by harming my followers\add*.
\v 16 But instead \add of continuing to do that\add*, stand up now! I have appeared to you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* to tell you that I have chosen you to serve me. You must tell people about \add what I am showing you\add* as you are seeing me \add now\add*, and about what I \add will show you when\add* I will \add later\add* appear to you.
\v 17 I will protect you \add from those who will try to harm you, both\add* your own people and \add also\add* those who are not Jewish. I am sending you to them
\v 18 to help them to realize \f + \ft metonymy \f* what is true and to stop believing what is false \f + \ft metaphor \f*. I am sending you to them so that they may let God control them and not let Satan control them anymore. \add Then God\add* will forgive their sins and will accept them as his people because they believe in me.' \add That is what Jesus said to me\add*."

\v 15 Then I said, 'Who are you, Lord?' He said, 'I am Jesus! I am the one you are fighting against.
\v 16 But get up and stand on your feet! I have appeared to you in order to make you into a servant and a witness both of what you have seen of what you know about me now and what I will show you later.
\v 17 I will protect you from the people and the non-Jews to whom I will send you,
\v 18 in order to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of the enemy to God. In this way God will forgive their sins and give to them the things that all my people will have forever, the people who belong to me by faith.

\v 15 Then I said, 'Who are you, Lord?' The Lord replied, 'I am Jesus whom you persecute.
\v 16 Now get up and stand on your feet; because for this purpose I appeared to you, to appoint you to be a servant and a witness concerning the things that you know about me now and the things that I will show to you later;
\v 17 and I will rescue you from the people and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you,
\v 18 to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive from God the forgiveness of sins and the inheritance that I give to them who are sanctified by faith in me.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues giving his defense to King Agrippa. In these verses he continues quoting his conversation with the Lord. 

  * **to open their eyes** - Helping people to understand the truth is spoken of as if a person were literally helping someone to open his eyes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to turn them from darkness to light** - Helping someone to stop doing what is evil and to start trusting and obeying God is spoken of as if the person is literally leading someone out of a dark place into a place of light. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to turn them ... from the power of Satan to God** - Helping someone to stop obeying Satan and to start obeying God is spoken of as if a person were literally turning a person and taking them from the place where Satan rules and leading him to the place where God rules. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they may receive from God the forgiveness of sins** - The abstract noun "forgiveness" can be stated as the verb "forgive." AT: "God may forgive their sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the inheritance that I give** - The abstract noun "inheritance" may be stated as the verb "inherit." AT: "they may inherit that which I give" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the inheritance** - The blessings that Jesus gives to those who believe in him are spoken of as if they were an inheritance that children receive from their father. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **sanctified by faith in me** - Jesus choosing some people to belong to him is spoken of as if he literally set them apart from other people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
