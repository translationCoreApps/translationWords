====== Jeremiah 20 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===


Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 20:7-18, which is an extended quotation. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Pashhur ==
This chapter prophesied punishment against a specific leader named Pashhur. He was in charge of protecting the temple and had Jeremiah beaten and arrested. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:temple]])

== Jeremiah's reaction ==
Jeremiah's reaction contrasts with the reaction of the Jews in general. Although Jeremiah was not happy with Yahweh's actions, he still trusted in Yahweh. On the other hand, the Jews were not happy with the prophecies Yahweh gave to Jeremiah, so they beat the prophet. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])
