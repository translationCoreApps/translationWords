\v 22 Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man authenticated by God to you by mighty deeds and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves knowâ€”
\v 23 because of the determined plan and foreknowledge of God, he was delivered up, and you, by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed him;
\v 24 whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death from him, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.
