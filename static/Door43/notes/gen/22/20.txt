  * **Abraham was told** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "someone told Abraham" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Milcah has borne children, as well** - "Milcah has also borne children"
  * **Milcah** - This is the name of a woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **They were Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother** - "The name of his first born was Uz, and the names of the rest of his children were Buz his brother"
  * **Uz ... Buz ... Kemuel ... Aram ... Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel** - These are all names of men. Translate this so that it is clear that all of these except Aram are the sons of Nahor and Milcah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
