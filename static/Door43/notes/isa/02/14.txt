===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah speaks to the people of Judah in the form of a poem. He continues to describe what will happen on the day of Yahweh of Hosts ([[:en:bible:notes:isa:02:12|2:12]]). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **and against** - In 2:14-16 Isaiah lists things that God will destroy. Possible meanings are 1) these refer to prideful people that God will humble or 2) God will actually destroy all these things in the list.
  * **mountains ... hills** - These words are metaphors for the pride of the Israelites. They also appear in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:02:01|2:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **that are lifted up** - This is an idiom. AT: "that are very high" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **high tower ... impregnable wall** - These refer to things people would build around their cities so they could defend themselves against their enemies. They are a metaphor for the Israelites' pride and belief that they had no need for Yahweh and could stand against any punishment Yahweh would mete out to them for their sins. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **impregnable wall** - "wall that nothing can break down or go through"
  * **ships of Tarshish ... beautiful sailing vessels** - These refer to large boats that people used to travel far on the sea and bring back goods to the cities.
