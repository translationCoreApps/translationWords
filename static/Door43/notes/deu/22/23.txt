\v 23 If there is a girl who is a virgin, engaged to a man, and another man finds her in the city and sleeps with her,
\v 24 take both of them to the city gate, and stone them to death. You must stone the girl, because she did not cry out, even though she was in the city. You must stone the man, because he violated his neighbor's wife; and you will remove the evil from among you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "you" is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **engaged to a man** - "who is promised to marry a man"
  * **take ... and stone** - These commands are addressed to Israel as a group and so are plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **take both of them** - "then you must bring both the girl and the man who slept with her"
  * **because she did not cry out** - "because she did not call for help" 
  * **because he violated his neighbor's wife** - The Israelites at that time thought of a man and woman who had engaged each other for marriage as husband and wife. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "because he slept with a girl who belongs to a fellow Israelite" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])  
  * **and you will remove the evil from among you** - The adjective "evil" can be translated as a noun phrase. AT: "you must remove from among the Israelites the person who does this evil thing" or "you must execute this evil person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
