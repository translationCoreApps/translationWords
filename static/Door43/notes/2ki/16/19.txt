===== translationNotes: =====


  * **are they not written ... Judah?** - This question is used to either inform or remind the readers that the information about Ahaz is in this other book. This can also be stated in active form. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:08:22|8:23]]. AT: "they are written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah." or "someone has written about them in The Book ... Judah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Ahaz slept with his ancestors** - Sleeping represents dying. AT: "Ahaz died as his ancestors had" or "like his ancestors, Ahaz died"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **and was buried with his ancestors** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "and people buried him with his ancestors" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **became king in his place** - The phrase "in his place" is a metaphor meaning "instead of him." AT: "became king instead of Ahaz" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
