===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Rejoice and be glad** - These two words mean basically the same thing and emphasize the intensity of gladness. The writer uses these words sarcastically. AT: "Be very glad." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **Daughter of Zion ... daughter of Edom** - These are poetic names for the people of Jerusalem and of the land of Edom, which are spoken of here as if they were woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **to you also the cup will be passed** - The wine that people will drink from the cup is a symbol of Yahweh's anger. AT: "Yahweh will also judge you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he will not extend your exile** - Here the word "he" refers to Yahweh.
  * **uncover your sins** - "expose your sins"
