====== Daniel 03 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The king's new idol ==

Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to worship the new idol. In the ancient Near East, refusing to worship the king was a sign of rebellion against the king. It was often considered the crime of treason. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sign]])

== The furnace ==

There was a forth person with them in the furnace and because of this they were not hurt. Most scholars believe this to be Jesus before he was born.
