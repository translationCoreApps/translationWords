====== Jeremiah 18 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 18:13-17, 19-23, which are extended quotations. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== Attacking Jeremiah ==
Things were so bad in Judah, they even attacked Jeremiah. To attack Yahweh's prophet was to attack Yahweh himself. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Simile ==

Like a potter can change what he is making from one type of pot to another, God can change his plans and not punish people if they repent. The image of God as a potter and mankind as clay is an important one in Scripture. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:repent]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
