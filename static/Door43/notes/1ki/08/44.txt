===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Suppose that your people go out ... suppose that they pray** - When Solomon was speaking, these hypothetical situations had not happened, but Solomon knew that they might happen in the future. Use the form in your language for talking about events that have not happened but might happen in the future. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **for your name** - The word "name" is a metonym for the person, and "for ... name" refers to worshiping the person. Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:03:01|3:2]]. AT: "in which people will worship you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **their prayer and their request** - The words "prayer" and "request" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the people are sincere as they make their request. Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:08:27|8:28]]. AT: "their request" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
