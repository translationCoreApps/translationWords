===== translationNotes: =====

  * **can anyone understand the extensive spread of the clouds and the thunder from his hut?** - The implicit answer to this question is "no." AT: "no one can understand the extensive spread of the clouds and the thunder from his hut." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **his hut** - Here "his hut" probably represents, in an extremely understated way, the vast sky, above which God was apparently thought to live. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
