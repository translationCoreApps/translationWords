===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **out of the hand of him who struck him** - Here "hand" refers to power or control. AT: "so the one who struck him will not strike him again" or "from the man who hit him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **your eye must have no pity** - Here "eye" means the whole person. AT: "you should not feel sorry for her" or "you must not show her mercy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
