===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Ezekiel continues telling about the vision he saw.

  * **I heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake: "Blessed be the glory of Yahweh from his place!"** - Some versions take "Blessed ... place!" as a words that the "great earthquake" spoke: "I heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake, which said, 'Blessed be the glory of Yahweh from his place!'" Others understand the sound of the earthquake as the sound of the glory of Yahweh leaving his place, "as the glory of Yahweh left its place, I heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake."
  * **the sound of a great earthquake** - It is not clear if the sound came from an earthquake, from a voice that was loud like an earthquake, or from the wings and wheels. "a sound like the sound of a great earthquake" or "a voice speaking; the voice sounded like a great earthquake" or "a loud rumbling noise"
  * **the glory of Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:01:27|1:28]].
  * **the sound of a great earthquake** - "a loud, deep and powerful rumbling sound like that of an earthquake"
