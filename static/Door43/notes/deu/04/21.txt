===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Yahweh was angry with me because of you** - This refers to when Moses disobeyed what Yahweh told him to do because Moses was angry with the people of Israel. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:01:37|1:37]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Yahweh your God is giving to you** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
