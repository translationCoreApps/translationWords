===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:christ]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:amen]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:reward]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **is not against us** - "is not opposing us" 
  * **is for us** - It can be explained clearly what this means. AT: "is trying to achieve the same goals that we are" (UDB)
  * **gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ** - Jesus speaks about giving someone a cup of water as an example of how one person may help another. This is a metaphor for helping someone in any way. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **not lose** - This negative sentence emphasizes the positive meaning. In some languages, it is more natural to use a positive statement. AT: "definitely receive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
