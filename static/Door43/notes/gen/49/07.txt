===== translationNotes: =====


  * **May their anger be cursed, for it was fierce—and their fury, for it was cruel** - God cursing Simeon and Levi is spoken of as if God were cursing their anger and fury. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The Lord says, 'I will curse them because of their fierce anger and their cruel fury" or "I, the Lord, will curse them because of their fierce anger and their cruel fury" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **May their anger be cursed** - In prophecy, the prophet will often speak the words of God as if God himself were speaking. This emphasizes how closely united the prophet and God are.
  * **and their fury, for it was cruel** - The words "I will curse" are understood. AT: "and I will curse their fury, for it was cruel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel** - The word "I" refers to God. The word "them" refers to Simeon and Levi but they are a metonymy standing for their descendants. The words "Jacob" and "Israel" are a metonymy standing for all people of Israel. AT: "I will divide their descendants and scatter them among all the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
