====== Exodus 34 General Notes ======

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "He will bring the punishment for the fathers' sin on their children" ==
This phrase does not mean that a child is necessarily punished for the sins of their parents. Many scholars believe that this passage indicates that a parent's sins will have consequences that will affect their children and grandchildren. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])
