====== 1 Corinthians 10 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. Many English translations indent the line of 10:7, which is a quotation from the Old Testament. 

Chapters 8-10 form a single unit, answering the question: "Is it alright to eat meat that has been sacrificed to an idol?" In this chapter, Paul uses the exodus as a warning to people not to sin.  Then, he returns to discussing meat offered to idols, using the Lord's Super as an example. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Exodus ==
Paul uses the experiences of Israel leaving Egypt and roaming the desert as a warning to the believers. Although they all followed Moses, they all died on the way and none of them reached the Promised Land. Some worshiped an idol, some tested Christ and some grumbled. This is a warning for Christians not to sin because temptation can be resisted because God provides a way of escape. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland]])
 
== Eating meat sacrificed to idol ==
Paul discusses meat offered to idols. Christians are allowed to eat but it may hurt others. So when buying meat or eating with a friend, do not ask if it has been offered to idols; but if someone tells you it has been offered to idols, don't eat it for the sake of that person. Do not offend anyone but seek to save them. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:save]])
