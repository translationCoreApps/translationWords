\v 15 Look down from heaven and take notice from your holy and glorious habitation. 
\q1 Where are your zeal and your mighty acts? 
\q1 Your pity and your compassionate actions are kept from us.
\q1
\v 16 For you are our father, 
\q1 though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does not recognize us, 
\q1 you, Yahweh, are our father. 'Our Redeemer' has been your name from ancient times.
