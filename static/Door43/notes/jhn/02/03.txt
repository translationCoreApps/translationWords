===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Woman** - This refers to Mary. If it is impolite for a son to call his mother "woman" in your language, use another word that is polite, or leave it out.
  * **why do you come to me?** - This question is asked to provide emphasis. AT: "this has nothing to do with me" or "you should not tell me what to do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **My time has not yet come** - The word "time" is a metonym that represents the right occasion for Jesus to show that he is the Messiah by working miracles. AT: "It is not yet the right time for me to perform a mighty act" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
