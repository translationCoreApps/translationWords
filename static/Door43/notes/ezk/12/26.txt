\v 26 Yahweh also gave me this message:
\v 27 "You human, the Israelite people are constantly saying about you, 'The things that he sees in visions \add will not happen soon\add*. They are about \add things that will happen\add* many years from now, far in the future.'
\p
\v 28 Therefore say to them, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord \f + \ft doublet \f* says: I will no longer delay \add causing to happen\add* any of the things that I have prophesied. Whatever I have predicted will \add soon\add* happen.'~"

\v 26 Again the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 27 "Son of man! Behold, the house of Israel has said, 'The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of far off times.'
\v 28 Therefore say to them, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: My words will not be delayed any longer, but the word that I have spoken will be doneâ€”this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.'"
