===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah speaks Yahweh's words to the people of Judah in the form of a poem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Wash, cleanse yourselves** - Here God compares a person who stops sinning with one who washes his body. AT: "Repent and wash the sin from your heart like you wash the dirt from your body" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **remove the evil of your deeds from my sight** - God was not telling them to do their evil deeds somewhere else, but to stop doing them. AT: "stop doing the evil deeds that I see you doing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **make straight the oppression** - God speaks of people who oppress others as if they had made crooked something that should be straight, and he calls on them to make that object straight again. The abstract noun "oppression" can be translated as a verb. AT: "make sure that those helpless people you have harmed no longer suffer from the bad things you have done to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **give justice to the fatherless** - "be fair to the children who do not have fathers"
  * **defend the widow** - "protect the women whose husbands have died"
