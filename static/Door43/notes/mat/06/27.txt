\v 27 None of you can, just by worrying, add years to your life. You cannot add even one minute to your life! So you should not worry about things you need.
\p
\v 28 You should also not worry about whether you will have enough clothes to wear. Think about the way flowers grow in the fields. They do not work to earn money, and they do not make their own clothes.
\v 29 But I tell you that even though King Solomon, who lived long ago, wore very beautiful clothes, his clothes were not as beautiful as one of those flowers.

\v 27 Which one of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his lifespan?
\v 28 Why are you anxious about clothing? Think about the lilies in the fields, how they grow. They do not work, and they do not spin cloth.
\v 29 Yet I say to you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.

  * **Which one of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his lifespan?** - Jesus uses a question to teach the people. AT: "None of you can, just by worrying, add years to your life.

  * **one cubit** - A cubit is a measure of a little less than half a meter. Here it is a metaphor for adding time to how long a person will live. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
