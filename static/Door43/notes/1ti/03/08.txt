===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Deacons, in the same way, should be people whom others respect. They should be sincere when they speak. They should not drink too much wine, and they must not be greedy for money.
\v 9 They should believe in the true things that God has told us, and at the same time know what is right, and then do it.
\v 10 Find these qualities in them first, and then choose them to serve because no one can find anything wrong with them.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Deacons, likewise, should be dignified, not double-talkers. They should not drink too much wine or be greedy.
\v 9 They should keep the revealed truth of the faith with a clean conscience.
\v 10 They should also be approved first, then they should serve because they are blameless.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul gives some special instructions on how the deacons of the church and their wives should act and be.

  * **Deacons, likewise** - "Deacons, like overseers"
  * **should be dignified** - "should act properly" or "should be worthy of respect"
  * **not double-talkers** - Paul speaks about these people as if they could say two things at once. He means the person says one thing but mean something else. AT: "not insincere" or "and they must mean what they say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **They should keep the revealed truth of the faith** - "They must continue to believe the true message God revealed to us and that we believe." This refers to a truth that had existed for some time but that God was showing to them at that moment. Paul speaks of true teaching about God as if it were an object that a person could keep with himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the revealed truth** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the truth that God revealed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **with a clean conscience** - Paul speaks of a person's knowledge that he has done no wrong as if that knowledge or conscience were clean. AT: "knowing they have tried their hardest to do what is right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They should also be approved first** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Other believers should approve of them first" or "They should prove themselves first" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **be approved** - This means other believers should evaluate those who want to be a deacon and determine if they are fit to serve in the church.
