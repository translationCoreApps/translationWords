\q2 he remembers that he created us from dust
\q2 and that we therefore quickly fail to do what pleases him .
\q1
\v 15 We humans do not live forever;
\q2 we are like grass which withers and dies.
\q1 We are like wild flowers that bloom for a short while;
\q1
\v 16 but then the hot wind blows over them, and they disappear;
\q2 no one sees them again.

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 For he knows how we are formed;
\q he knows that we are dust.
\q
\v 15 As for man, his days are like grass;
\q he flourishes like a flower in a field.
\q
\v 16 The wind blows over it, and it disappears,
\q and no one can even tell where it once grew.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **how we are formed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "what our bodies are like" or "how he formed our bodies" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **he knows that we are dust** - When Yahweh created Adam the first man he created him from dust. AT: "he remembers that he created us from dust" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **As for man, his days are like grass** - In this simile, the length of man's life is being compared to the short length of time that grass grows before it dies. AT: "The length of man's life is short like that of grass" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **he flourishes like a flower in a field** - In this simile, how man grows over time is compared to how a flower grows. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **flourishes** - To "flourish" is to grow well or be healthy.
  * **The wind blows over it, and it disappears ... where it once grew** - These phrases continue to talk about flowers and grass. They compare how flowers and grass die to how man dies. AT: "The wind blows over the flowers and grass and they disappear, and no one can tell where they once grewâ€”it is the same way with man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
