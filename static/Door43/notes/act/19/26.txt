\v 26 Also, you know that \add this fellow\add* Paul has persuaded many people who live in Ephesus \add to no longer buy the images that we make. Now even the people from\add* many other towns in our province \add no longer want to buy what we make\add*. This fellow tells people that the gods that we have made \add and worship\add* are not gods \add and that we should not worship them\add*.
\v 27 \add If people continue to listen to him\add*, soon they will ruin our business. Besides, they will no longer think that they should \add come to\add* the temple of Artemis \add to worship her. People\add* all over our Asia \add province\add* and everywhere \f + \ft hyperbole \f* else worship \add our great\add* goddess \add Artemis. Soon people\add* may no longer consider that Artemis is great!"

\v 26 You know that Paul has taught many people who live in Ephesus to no longer buy the statues that we make. Now even the people from many other towns in our province no longer want to buy what we make. Paul tells people that the gods that we worship are not gods and that we should not worship them.
\v 27 If people listen to him, they will stop our business. People will not think that they should come any longer to the temple of Diana to worship her. People will no longer think that Diana is great. Yet all the province of Asia and even the whole world worship her!"

\v 26 You see and hear that, not only at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people. He is saying that there are no gods that are made with hands.
\v 27 Not only is there danger that our trade will no longer be needed, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana may be considered worthless. Then she would even lose her greatness, she whom all Asia and the world worships."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Demetrius continues to speak to the craftsmen.

  * **You see and hear that** - "You have come to know and understand that"
  * **turned away many people** - Paul's stopping people from worshiping idols is spoken of as though Paul were literally turning the people in a different direction. AT: "caused many people to stop worshiping the local gods" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He is saying that there are no gods that are made with hands** - Here the word "hands" can refer to the whole person. AT: He is saying that there are no gods that are made with the hands of people" or "He is saying that the idols that people make are not real gods" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **that our trade will no longer be needed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that the people will no longer want to buy idols from us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the temple of the great goddess Diana may be considered worthless** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the people will think there is no benefit in going to the temple to worship the great goddess Diana" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **she would even lose her greatness** - Diana's greatness only comes from what people think of her.
  * **whom all Asia and the world worships** - This was an exaggeration to show how popular the goddess Diana was. Here the words "Asia" and "the world" refer to the people in Asia and the known world. AT: "whom many people in Asia and in other parts of the world worship" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
