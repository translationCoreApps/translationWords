===== translationNotes: =====

  * **came to rest** - "landed" or "stopped on solid ground"
  * **in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month ... tenth month** - Because Moses wrote this book, it is possible he is referring to the seventh month and tenth month of the Hebrew calendar, but this is uncertain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **On the first day of the month** - "On the first day of the tenth month"
  * **appeared** - This can be made more explicit: "appeared above the surface of the water." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
