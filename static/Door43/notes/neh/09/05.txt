===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then the Levites ... said, "Stand up ... ever."** - Here the Levites are speaking to the people of Israel.
  * **give praise to Yahweh** - "bless Yahweh"
  * **Jeshua ... Kadmiel ... Bani ... Sherebiah ... Shebaniah** - men's names. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:neh:09:03|9:3-4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]) 
  * **Hashabneiah ... Hodiah ... Pethahiah** - men's names (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **May they bless your glorious name** - the Levites are speaking to Yahweh. "May the people of Judah bless your glorious name, Yahweh"
  * **the highest heavens, with all their host ... the host of heaven worship you** - A host is an army. The "host of heaven" speaks in a metaphor of the many stars as if they were an army. The stars in turn are a metaphor for the many angels. The stars worshiping Yahweh is a metaphor for the angels worshiping Yahweh. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
