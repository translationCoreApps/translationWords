  * **Moab's disaster is soon to happen; calamity is hurrying quickly** - These two sentences mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Moab's destruction will happen very soon. AT: "Moab's enemies will destroy her very soon." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the strong staff, the honored rod, has been broken** - Here the words "staff" and "rod" refer to the power and political support that Moab provided to other nations. AT: "Moab's enemies have broken her great power." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
