====== Genesis 31 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== God's blessing ==
When Jacob left Paddam Aram, he left very wealthy. Despite his punishment of exile from Canaan, God still blessed Jacob and his family. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:bless]])

== Household gods ==
Although a few scholars believe the possession of the household gods was a sign of inheritance, this seems unlikely. It is probable that Rachel believed these idols would bring them "good luck" and would bring them great blessing. This was sinful because they were to trust in Yahweh, who already promised to bless them. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]], [[:en:obe:kt:inherit]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Irony ==
Laban's sons complained that Jacob cheated them out of their father's possessions. It was their father who tried to cheat Jacob out of what he promised to give Jacob. Jacob treated his brother Esau in the same way. Jacob cheated Esau out of their father's blessing.
