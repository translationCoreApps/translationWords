====== Genesis 19 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The evil desires of the Sodomites ==
The men of Sodom desired to have sexual relations with the angels who came to the city appearing as men. It is possible that they were trying to do this against the angel's desires. This is known as "rape." This was also view as especially evil because he was willing to sacrifice his own children for the sake of protecting his guests. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:evil]])

== Hospitality ==
Hospitality, or being kind to a visitor, was very important in the ancient Near East. Lot showed these men great kindness and did his utmost to protect them from the homosexual attacks of the people of Sodom. Lot put the principal of hospitality over all other matters. He did not stand up to the evil actions of the Sodomites or protect his children. Instead, he avoided offending his guest. This should have been less important to him.
