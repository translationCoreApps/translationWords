===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize the people's capacity to learn from their ancestors, given the brevity of life and the ancestors' willingness to impart teachings. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **give your attention to what our ancestors learned** - "study carefully what our ancestors discovered" or "consider what our forefathers learned"
  * **our days on earth are a shadow** - In this simile, life is compared to a shadow; both pass by quickly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Will they not teach you and tell you? Will they not speak words from their hearts?** - Bildad poses these questions to rebuke Job. AT: "They will teach you and tell you, and from their understanding bring forth words." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
