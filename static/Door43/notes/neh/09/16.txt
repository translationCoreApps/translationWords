<usfm>
\v 16 But our ancestors were very proud and stubborn [IDI], and they did not obey what you commanded them to do.
\v 17 They refused to heed you, and they forgot about all the miracles that you had performed for them. Instead, they became stubborn [IDI], and they appointed someone to lead them back to Egypt, where they would be slaves again! But you are a God who forgives us and who acts kindly and mercifully \add toward us\add*. You do not quickly become angry. You are always faithfully loving us.

\v 16 But our ancestors were very proud and stubborn. They refused even to listen to what you commanded them to do.
\v 17 They refused to listen to you. They forgot about all the miracles that you had performed for them. They became stubborn, and because they rebelled against you, they appointed a leader to take them back to Egypt, where they would be slaves again! But you are a God who forgives again and again. You are slow to be angry, and your love for them is never-ending and it is great. You did not abandon them.

\v 16 But they and our ancestors acted disrespectfully, and they were stubborn, and did not listen to your commandments.
\v 17 They refused to listen, and they did not think about the wonders that you had done among them, but became stubborn, and in their rebellion they appointed a leader to return to their slavery. But you are a God who is full of forgiveness, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love. You did not abandon them.

  * **Connecting Statement:** - In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

  * **they and our ancestors** - the Israelites at the time of Moses and the people of Israel after the time of Moses
  * **they were stubborn ... became stubborn** - The literal statement is "they hardened their necks." If your language has a different idiom for being stubborn, you may want to use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the wonders that you had done among them** - "the miracles that you had done among them"
  * **they appointed a leader to return to their slavery** - "they appointed a leader to take them back to the land where they had been slaves." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **who is full of forgiveness** - The desire to forgive is spoken of as if it were a liquid that could fill a container. AT: "who is ready to forgive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
