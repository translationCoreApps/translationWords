====== 1 Corinthians 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the last line of 4:6, which is a quotation from the Old Testament. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Pride ==
Paul contrasts the Corinthian's pride with the humbleness of the apostles. The Corinthian believers have no reason to be proud because all that they have, and all they are, is a gift from God. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:apostle]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
There are many metaphors in this chapter. The apostles are described as servants. Paul speaks of a victory parade where the apostles are the prisoners who will be killed. He uses a rod to stand for punishment. He calls himself their father because he is their "spiritual father. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]])

== Irony ==
Paul uses irony to shame the pride of the Corinthians. The Corinthian believers are reigning but the apostles are suffering. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
