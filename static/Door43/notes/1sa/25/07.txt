====== 1 Samuel 25:7-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 I heard people say that you are cutting the wool from your sheep. Previously, when your shepherds were among us, we did not harm them. All the time that your shepherds were among us at Camel, we did not steal any sheep from them.
\v 8 You can ask your servants if this is true, and they will tell you \add that it is true\add*. We have come here at a time when you are celebrating, so I ask you to please be kind to us and give these men whatever extra food you have, for me, David, and my men to eat.'"

\v 7 I hear that you have shearers. Your shepherds have been with us, and we did them no harm, and they missed nothing the whole time they were in Carmel.
\v 8 Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Now let my young men find favor in your eyes, for we have come on a festive day. Please give whatever you have on hand to your servants and to your son David.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **you have shearers** - "your shearers are working" or "your shearers have sheep to shear." David wants his men to speak so that Nabal understands that his sheep were well because David's men helped guard them. 
  * **we did them no harm, and they missed nothing** - David is pointing out how he and his men offered protection to Nabal's servants and flocks. This can be stated in positive form. AT: "we kept them and all their property from harm" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **let my young men find favor in your eyes** - Here the eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. AT: "may you be pleased with my young men" or "may you consider my young men favorably" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **to your servants** - David was expressing respect toward Nabal by calling his men Nabal's servants.
  * **your son David** - David spoke as if he were Nabal's son to show that he respected Nabal, who was an older man.
