\v 8 So Abram said to Lot, "Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; after all, we are family.
\v 9 Is not the whole land before you? Go ahead and separate yourself from me. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right, then I will go to the left."

  * **after all, we are family** - "because we are family"
  * **family** - "kinsmen" or "relatives." Lot was Abraham's nephew.
  * **Is not the whole land before you?** - This rhetorical question can be translated as a positive statement. AT: "The whole land is available for you to use." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Go ahead and separate yourself from me** - Abraham was speaking kindly to Lot and encouraging him to do something that would help them both. "Let's separate."
  * **If you go to the left, then I will go to the right** - Possible meanings are 1) "If you go one way, then I will go the other" or 2) "If you go to the north, I will go to the south." Abram let Lot choose the part of the land he wanted, and Abram would take what remained.
