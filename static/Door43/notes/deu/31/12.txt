===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking to the priests and the elders.

  * **your foreigner who is within your city gates** - Here "city gates" represents the cities themselves. Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the instances of "your" here are singular. AT: "your foreigners who live in your cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **keep all the words of this law** - "carefully obey all the commands in this law"
