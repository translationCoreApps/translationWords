\q1 You must believe that only I am God
\q2 and that there is no other God,
\q2 and that there is no other one who can save you!
\q1
\v 5 I took care of your \add ancestors\add* when they were in the desert,
\q2 where it was extremely \add hot and\add* dry.
\q1
\v 6 When I provided food for them,
\q2 their stomachs were full, and they were satisfied.
\q1 But then they became proud
\q2 and they forgot about me,
\q2 \add and you are like your ancestors\add*!

\v 4 But I am Yahweh, whom you should worship;
\q2 I am the one who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
\q1 You must worship no other God; you must worship only Me.
\q2 There is no one else who can rescue you.
\q1
\v 5 I took charge of you in the wilderness,
\q2 in a desert where there was no water to drink. 
\q1
\v 6 When I provided food for you,
\q2 you ate as much as you wanted and were satisfied.
\q1 But when you were no longer hungry, you became proud
\q2 and forgot about me.

\q
\v 4 But I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
\q You must acknowledge no God but me;
\q you must acknowledge that besides me, there is no other savior.
\q
\v 5 I knew you in the wilderness,
\q in the land of great dryness.
\q
\v 6 When you had pasture, then you became full;
\q and when you were filled, your heart became lifted up.
\q For that reason you forgot me.
