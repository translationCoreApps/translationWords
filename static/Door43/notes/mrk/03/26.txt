\v 27 Contrary to \add what you say about me\add*, someone can enter the house of a strong man \add like Satan\add* and carry off his possessions only if he first ties up the strong man. Then \add and only then\add* will he \add be able to\add* steal the things in that man's house."

\v 26 Similarly, if Satan and his evil spirits were fighting one another, instead of remaining strong, he would become powerless.
\v 27 No one can go into the house of a strong man and take his possessions away from him unless he first ties up the strong man. Only then will he be able to steal the things in that man's house."

\v 26 If Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand, but has come to an end.
\v 27 But no one can enter into the house of a strong man and steal his belongings without tying up the strong man first, and then he will plunder his house.
