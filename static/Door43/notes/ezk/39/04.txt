<usfm>
\v 4 You will fall dead on the mountains of Israel—you and all your troops and the soldiers who are with you. I will give you to the birds of prey and the wild beasts of the fields for food.
\v 5 You will fall dead on the surface of the field, for I myself declare it—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
\v 6 Then I will send out fire on Magog and on those living in safety on the coasts, and they will know that I am Yahweh.
