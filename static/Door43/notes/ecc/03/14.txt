====== Ecclesiastes 03:14-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I also know that what God does endures forever. No one can add to what God does, and no one can take away from the things that God does. God does those things in order that people would revere him.
\q1
\v 15 Things that exist now have already existed previously,
\q2 and things that will happen in the future have already happened previously;
\q2 God causes the same things to happen many times.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I know that whatever God does lasts forever. Nothing can be added to it or taken away, because it is God who has done it so that people will approach him with honor.
\q1
\v 15 Whatever exists has already existed;
\q2 whatever will exist has already existed.
\q1 God makes human beings seek hidden things.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa God makes human beings seek hidden things \fqb , other modern versions interpret this line in different ways. \f*
