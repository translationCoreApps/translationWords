\v 26 But \add my\add* Father will send the Holy Spirit. He is the one who will encourage\f + \ft Or: be like a legal counsel for \f* you. He will come with my authority \f + \ft metonymy \f*. He will teach you all of \add God's truth that you need to know\add*. He will also cause you to remember all the things that I have told you.
\v 27 As I leave you, I am causing you to have \add inner\add* peace. This \add inner\add* peace comes from me. I am not causing you to have something that those who do not belong to God \f + \ft metonymy \f* can give you. \add So\add* stop being anxious\f + \ft Or: worried \f*, and do not be afraid.

\v 25 I have said these things to you while I am still with you.
\v 26 The Helper, the one who comes alongside to be with you—my Father will send him in my name. He will teach you everything that you need to know. He will also cause you to remember all the things that I have told you.
\v 27 As I leave you with peace, it is my peace that I am giving to you. I give you a kind of peace no one and nothing that belongs to this world can give you. So do not be upset or anxious; and do not be afraid.

\v 25 I have said these things to you, while I am staying with you.
\v 26 However, the Comforter—the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name—he will teach you everything and he will remind you of everything that I said to you.
\v 27 I leave you peace; I give you my peace. I do not give it as the world gives. Do not let your heart be troubled, and do not be afraid.
