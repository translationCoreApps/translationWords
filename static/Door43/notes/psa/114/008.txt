===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He turned the rock into a pool of water, the hard rock into a spring of water** - These two phrases are parallel. The writer describes Yahweh causing water to flow from the rock as if he turned the rock into water. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the hard rock into a spring of water** - The verb may be supplied from the previous phrase. AT: "He turned the hard rock into a spring of water" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
