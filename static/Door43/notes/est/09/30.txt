\v 30-31 What they wrote \add in the second letter\add* was, "We wish that all of you will be living peacefully and safely\f + \ft Or: righteously \f*. We want you and your descendants to celebrate Purim each year on the days that we two established, and to do the things that we two told you to do." In that letter, Queen Esther and Mordecai also gave them instructions about fasting\f + \ft Or: abstaining from eating food \f* and being sorrowful. Then copies of that letter were sent to all the Jews who were living in the 127 provinces of the empire.
\v 32 The letter that Esther wrote about the manner in which they should celebrate the Purim feast was also written in an official record.

\v 32 The command of Esther confirmed these regulations that explained how they should celebrate the Purim festival. The instructions about the feast and the account of these events were written down in the book of history.
