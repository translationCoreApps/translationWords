===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Rabbi, right now the Jews are trying to stone you, and you are going back there again?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to emphasize that the disciples do not want Jesus to go to Jerusalem. AT: "Teacher, you surely do not want to go back there! The Jews were trying to stone you the last time you were there!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the Jews** - This is a synecdoche for the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus. AT: "the Jewish leaders" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Are there not twelve hours of light in a day?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "You know that the day has twelve hours of light!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If someone walks in the daytime, he will not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world** - People who walk in the light of the day can see well and do not stumble. "Light" is a metaphor for "truth." Jesus is implying that people who live according to truth will be able to successfully do the things that God wants them to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
