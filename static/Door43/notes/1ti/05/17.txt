===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul again talks of how elders (overseers) should be treated and then gives Timothy some personal instructions.

  * **Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "All believers should think of the elders who are good leaders as worthy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **double honor** - Possible meanings are 1) "of respect and payment" or 2) "more respect than others receive"
  * **those who work with the word and in teaching** - Paul speaks about the word as if it is an object which a person can work with. AT: "those who preach and teach God's word" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For the scripture says** - This is personification that means that this is what someone has written in the scriptures. AT: "For we read in the scriptures that" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **You shall not put a muzzle on an ox while it treads the grain** - Paul is using this quotation as a metaphor meaning that church leaders deserve to receive payment from the Christian community for their work. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **muzzle** - a sleeve that goes over an animal's snout and mouth to prevent it from eating while it is doing work (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **treads the grain** - This is when an ox walks on or pulls a heavy object over the cut grain to separate the grain from the stalks. The oxen were allowed to eat some of the grain as they worked.
  * **is worthy of** - "deserves"
