===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and the command "ask now" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) 

  * **Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?** - Here the people of Israel are reminded of how Yahweh has spoken to them in an amazing way in the past. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "No other people besides you has heard God speak from the middle of the fire and lived." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **hear the voice of God speaking** - The word "voice" is a metonym for God, who was speaking. AT: "hear God's voice as he spoke" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
