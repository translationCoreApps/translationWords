===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.

  * **the end is upon you** - The "end" is spoken of as if it were a robber attacking the people. AT: "your life is finished" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **I am sending out my wrath on you** - "Wrath" is spoken of as if it were an arrow that Yahweh was shooting at the people. AT: "I am angry, and I will punish you"
  * **according to your ways** - "according to the things you do" or "because of the wicked things you do"
  * **I will bring all your abominations upon you** - "I will punish you for doing those things that I hate so much"
  * **For my eyes will not pity you** - The eye is a metonym for what the person thinks. AT: "For I will not look at you with compassion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will bring your ways upon you** - The way a person lives is spoken of as a path on which one walks. AT: "I will punish you for the things you have done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
