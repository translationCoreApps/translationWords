====== Jeremiah 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 4:1-3, 4-9, which are extended quotations.

The prophecy revealed to Jeremiah is recorded in 3:19-4:3. Despite covering more than one chapter, this should be seen as one unit. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:reveal]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Yahweh's punishment ==
This chapter prophecies Yahweh's punishment. This should bring Judah to repentance, but it does not. It is also intended to make the nations fear the power of Yahweh and make them desire to worship him. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:repent]] and [[:en:obe:kt:fear]])
