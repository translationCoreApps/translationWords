===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 The cities that have strong walls around them will be empty;
\q2 like the desert, they will have no one living in them.
\q1 The houses will be abandoned,
\q2 and the streets will be full of weeds.
\q1 Calves will eat grass there and lie down there;
\q2 they will chew up all the leaves on the trees.
\q1
\v 11 \add The Israelite people are like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* dry branches on a tree;
\q2 women break them off and use them to make fires \add under their cooking pots\add*.
\q1 Our Israelite people do not have any sense;
\q2 so Yahweh, who created them, will not act mercifully toward them
\q2 or be kind to them.

\q1
\v 10 For the fortified city is desolate, the habitation is deserted and forsaken like the wilderness.
\q1 There a calf feeds, and there he lies down and consumes its branches.
\q1
\v 11 When the boughs are withered, they will be broken off. Women will come and make fires with them,
\q1 for this is not a people of understanding.
\q1 Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them, and he who made them will not be merciful to them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For the fortified city is ... consumes its branches** - Here Isaiah describes an event that will happen in the future as if it already happened. This emphasizes that it certainly will happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])
  * **For the fortified city is desolate, the habitation is deserted and forsaken like the wilderness** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The cities that were strong and had many people living in them will become empty like a desert" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the fortified city ... the habitation** - This does not refer to a specific city or habitation but to cities and habitations in general. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **a calf feeds, and there he lies down and consumes** - Here "calf" represents calves or cattle in general. AT: "calves feed, and there they lie down and consume" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **When the boughs ... not a people of understanding** - The people becoming so weak because they disobey Yahweh so that enemies can easily destroy them is spoken of as if they are dry branches that women break off of a tree. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **When the boughs are withered, they will be broken off. Women will come and make fires with them** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "When the branches wither, women will come and break them off and make fires with them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **this is not a people of understanding** - This can be made more explicit. AT: "this is not a people who understands Yahweh or his law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a people** - Possible meanings are 1) "people" refers to the people of Israel or 2) "people" refers the people of foreign nations who oppress the people of Israel.
  * **Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them, and he who made them will not be merciful to them** - Both clauses mean the same thing. AT: "Because they do not understand, Yahweh, the one who made them, will not be merciful to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
