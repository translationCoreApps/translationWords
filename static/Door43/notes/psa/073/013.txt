\q
\v 13 Surely it is in vain that I have guarded my heart
\q and washed my hands in innocence.
\q
\v 14 For all the day long I have been afflicted
\q and disciplined every morning.
\q
\v 15 If I had said, "I will say these things,"
\q then I would have betrayed this generation of your children.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verses 13 and 14, Asaph continues to describe how he sometimes wants to complain to God about those who are "arrogant" and "wicked" ([[:en:bible:notes:psa:073:001|73:3]]). In verse 15 he begins to talk about what he is really thinking.


  * **I have** - The word "I" refers to Asaph.
  * **guarded my heart** - Asaph speaks of guarding his heart as if he were guarding a city or building against enemies. AT: "I have kept my thoughts pure" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **washed my hands in innocence** - The writer speaks of his purity as if he had washed his hands with innocence instead of with water. AT: "my actions have remained pure" or "I have washed my hands to show that I am innocent." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:026:006|26:6]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **all the day long** - "Always" or "Every day"
  * **I have been afflicted** - "You have made me suffer." See how "they are not afflicted" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:073:004|73:5]].
  * **I have been ... disciplined** - "I have been ... punished"
  * **If I had said, "I will say these things," then I would have betrayed this generation of your children** - This hypothetical situation did not happen. AT: "I never said, 'I will say these things,' so I did not betray this generation of your children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
