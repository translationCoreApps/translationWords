===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus then goes to Capernaum, teaches the people in the synagogue there, and commands a demon to leave a man.

  * **Then he** - "Then Jesus." This indicates a new event. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])
  * **went down to Capernaum** - The phrase "came down" is used here because Capernaum is lower in elevation than Nazareth.
  * **Capernaum, a city in Galilee** - "Capernaum, another city in Galilee" 
  * **astonished** - "greatly surprised" or "impressed" or "amazed"
  * **he spoke with authority** - "he spoke as one with authority" or "his words had great power"
