\v 28 So while Jesus was teaching in the temple courtyard, he called out as he taught, "Yes, you say you know me, and you think you know where I am from. But I have come here not because I appointed myself. Instead, the one who sent me bears the truth as his testimony, and you do not know him.
\v 29 I know him because I have come from him. He is the one who sent me."

\v 28 Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know me and know where I come from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, and you do not know him.
\v 29 I know him because I come from him and he sent me."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **cried out** - "spoke in a loud voice"
  * **in the temple** - Jesus and the people were actually in the courtyard of the temple. AT: "in the temple courtyard" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **You both know me and know where I come from** - John uses irony in this statement. The people believe that Jesus is from Nazareth. They do not know that God sent him from heaven and that he was born in Bethlehem. AT: "You all know me and you think you know where I come from" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **of myself** - "on my own authority." See how you translated "of himself" in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:05:19|5:19]].
  * **he who sent me is true** - "God is the one who sent me and he is true"
