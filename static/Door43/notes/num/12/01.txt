\v 1-2 Moses' older sister Miriam and his older brother Aaron were jealous of Moses and said, "Is Moses the only one to whom Yahweh has spoken messages to tell to us? Does Yahweh not speak messages through us two also?" They also criticized Moses because he had married a woman who was a descendant of the Cush people group. And Yahweh heard Miriam and Aaron complaining about Moses.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Has Yahweh spoken only with Moses? Has he not spoken also with us?** - Miriam and Aaron use these questions to complain that Moses had so much authority and they did not. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "Yahweh has not spoken only with Moses. He has also spoken with us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Now Yahweh heard** - The word "Now" hear draws attention to the important point that follows. 
  * **Now the man Moses** - "Now" is used to mark a break in the main story line. The narrator tells background information about Moses' character. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
