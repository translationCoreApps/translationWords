===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

  * **spices** - dried plants that people grind into a powder and put in oil or food to give it a nice smell or flavor. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:25:03|25:6]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **five hundred shekels ... 250 shekels** - "500 shekels ... 250 shekels." A shekel is about 11 grams. Translators may use units that people know and round numbers: "5.7 kilograms ... 11.4 kilograms" or "six kilograms ... three kilograms" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]])
  * **cinnamon ... cane ... cassia** - These are sweet spices. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **the weight of the shekel of the sanctuary** - There were evidently shekels of more than one weight at the time. This specified which one was to be used. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:30:11|30:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]])
  * **one hin** - Translators may use units that people know and round numbers: "3.7 liters" or "four liters"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bvolume]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]])
  * **with these ingredients** - "with these items"
  * **the work of a perfumer** - Possible meanings are 1) Moses was to have a perfumer do the work or 2) Moses was to do the work himself the way a perfumer would do it.
  * **a perfumer** - a person who is skilled in mixing spices and oils
