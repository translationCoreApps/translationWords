\v 11 But the swamps and marshes \add along the shore\add* will not become fresh; they will be left to make salt.
\v 12 Many kinds of fruit trees will grow on both sides of the river. Their leaves will not wither, and they will always have fruit. They will bear more fruit every month, because the water that comes from the temple flows continually to the trees. Their fruit will be good to eat and their leaves will be good for healing."

\v 11 But the Salt Sea's swamps and marshes will not be made fresh; they will be for providing salt.
\v 12 Beside this river on its banks, on both sides, all kinds of trees will grow that bear food. Their leaves will not wither and their fruit will never fail to grow. Each month the trees will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves will be for healing.
