===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The Jewish leaders interrupt Jesus as he is speaking to the crowd.

  * **grumbled** - talked unhappily
  * **I am the bread** - Just as bread is necessary for our physical life, Jesus is necessary for our spiritual life. AT: "I am the one who is like true bread." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:35|6:35]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **Is not this Jesus ... whose father and mother we know?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to emphasize that the Jewish leaders believe that Jesus is no one special. AT: "This is just Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know! (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **How then does he now say, 'I have come down from heaven'?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to emphasize that the Jewish leaders do not believe that Jesus came from heaven. AT: "He is lying when he says that he came from heaven!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
