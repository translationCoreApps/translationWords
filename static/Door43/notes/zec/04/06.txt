\v 6 Then the angel said to me, "This is the message from Yahweh to you, Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah: 'You will do what I want you to do, but it will not be by your own strength or power. It will be done by the power of my Spirit,' says Yahweh, commander of the angel armies."
\v 7 The angel continued to speak to me: "Zerubbabel, you have many difficult matters to handle. They are like high mountains. But it will be as though they became flat land. And you will bring to the new temple the final stone, the highest stone, to complete it. When you set it in place, all the people will shout repeatedly, 'It is beautiful! May God bless it!'"

\v 6 So he said to me, "This is the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel:
\q Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,
\q says Yahweh of hosts.
\v 7 What are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain, 
\q and he will bring out the top stone to shouts of 'Grace! Grace to it!'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The angel who speaks with Zechariah continues to explain the vision.

  * **Zerubbabel** - This is the name of a man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Not by might nor by power** - Possible meanings are 1) that the words "might" and "power" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the greatness of Zerubbabel's strength, or 2) that the word "might" refers to military strength and the word "power" refers to Zerubbabel's physical ability. AT: "Certainly not by your own strength" or "Not by military strength nor by your own power." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **What are you, great mountain?** - Yahweh asks this question to the mountain to point out that through the Spirit of Yahweh, not even a mountain is strong enough to overpower Zerubbabel. AT: "Great mountain, even you are weak compared to Zerubbabel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **he will bring out the top stone** - The top stone is the last stone placed when building something.
