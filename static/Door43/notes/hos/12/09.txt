===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking. He seems to say that the luxurious homes in the northern kingdom will be destroyed, and that he will make the people live once again in tents, as their ancestors had done when celebrating the Festival of Shelters, which had probably been long discontinued by the time of this prophecy.

  * **I am your God from the land of Egypt** - This may mean, "I am your God, who brought your ancestors from the land of Egypt" or "I have been your God ever since you were in the land of Egypt," or "I became your God when you were in the land of Egypt."
  * **in tents** - This may be a reference to the coming scattering of the Jews. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **By the hand of the prophets** - "Hand" is often used to introduce the one who carries out an action. AT: "Through the prophets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I gave parables** - Some modern versions interpret this difficult passage as, "I will destroy."
