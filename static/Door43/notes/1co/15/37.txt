====== 1 Corinthians 15:37-39 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 A seed, such as a wheat seed, is very different from the plant that sprouts from it.
\v 38 God gives everything that lives the form that he desires. He gives each seed its own form.
\v 39 \add Similarly\add*, people, animals, birds, and fish all have flesh, but each one has a different kind of flesh.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 And what a farmer plants does not look the same as what will come up. It is only a bare seed; it will change into something entirely different.
\v 38 God will give it a new body just as he chooses, and to each seed put into the ground he will give a different body.
\v 39 Not all living creatures are the same. There are human beings, and there are animals on the land of many kinds, and there are the birds and fish. All of them are different.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 What you sow is not the body that will be, but a bare seed. It may become wheat or something else.
\v 38 But God will give it a body as he chooses, and to each seed its own body.
\v 39 Not all flesh is the same. Instead, there is one flesh of human beings, and another flesh for animals, and another flesh for birds, and another for fish.
</usfm>

===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:other:sow]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:body]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:seed]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:flesh]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **what you sow is not the body that will be** - Paul uses the metaphor of the seed again to say that God will resurrect the dead body of the believer, but that body will not appear as it was. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **what you sow** - Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so the word "you" here is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **God will give it a body as he chooses** - "God will decide what kind of body it will have"
  * **flesh** - In the context of animals, "flesh" may be translated as "body," "skin," or "meat."
