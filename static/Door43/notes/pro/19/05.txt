  * **A false witness will not go unpunished** - This can be written in positive and active form. AT: "They will certainly punish a false witness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **he who breathes out lies will not escape** - This means that he will be captured. AT: "they will capture the one who breathes out lies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])

  * **a generous person** - someone who often gives away things
  * **everyone is a friend** - This is a slight exaggeration. AT: "it seems that everyone is a friend" or "almost everyone is a friend" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
