\q1 No one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* has gathered\f + \ft Or: held \f* the wind in his hand.
\q1 No one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* has wrapped the water \add in the ocean\add* in \add a piece of\add* cloth
\q2 and no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* has established the boundaries of the earth.
\q1 \add If you know those things, tell me\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* his name, and the names of his children \f + \ft sarcasm \f*.
