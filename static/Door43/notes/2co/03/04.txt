====== 2 Corinthians 03:4-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 I \add can very\add* confidently \add write these things about the work that Silas, Timothy, and I did among you, because God knows that what I write is true. We\f + \ft exclusive \f* are true workers\add* for God\add because of what\add* Christ \add has done for us\add*.
\v 5 We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, by ourselves, do not have the ability \add to do this work\add*. None of us \add apostles\add* can say, "\add I have changed the lives of these people\add*." God is the one \add who has given us this ability\add*.
\v 6 He is the one who enables us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* to be his messengers. \add He has enabled us to tell people the message\add* about the new agreement \add that he is making with them\add*. This is not a \add message about obeying all the\add* written laws \add of his old agreement that he made with the Jewish people\add*. Instead, \add it is a message about God giving us his\add* Spirit. \add Previously, God condemned people to be\add* separated from him forever \add if they did not obey his laws\add*. But by \add God's new agreement\add* his Spirit enables people to live \add eternally\add*.

\v 4 This is how we trust God, because we are joined to Christ.
\v 5 We are not able to do anything for God in our own strength, so we cannot claim to be able to. Instead, it is God who gives us all we need to serve him.
\v 6 God gave us what we needed to be servants of the new covenant. This covenant does not get its strength from the law that was written down, but from the Spirit of God. The written letter of the law brings death, but the Spirit gives life.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 And this is the confidence that we have through Christ before God.
\v 5 We are not competent in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us. Instead, our competence is from God.
\v 6 It is God who made us able to be servants of a new covenant. This is a covenant not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **this is the confidence** - This refers to what Paul has just said. His confidence comes from knowing that the Corinthians are the validation of his ministry before God.
  * **competent in ourselves** - "qualified in ourselves" or "sufficient in ourselves"
  * **to claim anything as coming from us** - Here the word "anything" refers to anything pertaining to Paul's apostolic ministry. AT: "to claim that anything we have done in ministry comes from our own efforts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **our competence is from God** - "God gives us our sufficiency"
  * **a covenant not of the letter** - Here the word "letter" means letters of the alphabet and refers to words that people write down. The phrase alludes to the Old Testament law. AT: "a covenant not based on commands that men have written" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **but of the Spirit** - The Holy Spirit is the one who establishes God's covenant with people. AT: "but a covenant based on what the Spirit does" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the letter kills** - Paul speaks of the Old Testament law as a person who kills. Following that law leads to spiritual death. AT: "the written law leads to death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
