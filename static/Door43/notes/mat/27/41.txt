\v 41 In the same way the chief priests were mocking him, along with the scribes and elders, and said,
\v 42 "He saved others, but he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel. Let him come down off the cross, and then we will believe in him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He saved others, but he cannot save himself** - Possible meanings are 1) the Jewish leaders do not believe that Jesus saved others or that he can save himself, or 2) they believe he did save others but are laughing at him because now he cannot save himself.   (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **He is the King of Israel** - The leaders are mocking Jesus. They call him "King of Israel," but they do not really believe he is king. AT: "He says that he is the King of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
