\q2 I will not even look at you.
\q1 Even if you pray to me very frequently,
\q1 I will not listen to you,
\q2 because \add it is as though\add* your hands are covered with the blood \add of people whom you have killed\add*.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - God continues to speak to the people of Judah.

  * **they are a burden to me; I am tired of enduring them** - This compares how God feels about the people's celebrations to carrying a heavy object. AT: "they are a heavy load that I am tired of carrying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I hide my eyes from you** - This is a way of saying "I will not look at you" or "I will not pay attention to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **your hands are full of blood** - This is the reason that God will not listen to their prayers. The blood likely refers to violence that they have done against people. AT: "because it is like your hands are covered with the blood of those you have harmed" or "because you are guilty of violence" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
