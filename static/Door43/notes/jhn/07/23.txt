\v 23 You sometimes circumcise boys on the Sabbath so that you will not violate the law of Moses. So why are you angry with me, saying I worked on the Sabbath when I was healing a man! Healing someone is more wonderful, and it is a greater work than circumcising a baby!
\v 24 Stop deciding whether healing this man was right or wrong according to a false application of God's law, and that without any thought! Instead, decide what a person should do and how he should be judged by the principle of what is right and what is just according to God, not man."

\v 23 If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses is not broken, why are you angry with me because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?
\v 24 Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteously."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses is not broken** - "If you circumcise a male baby on the Sabbath so that you do not break the law of Moses" 
  * **why are you angry with me because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "you should not be angry with me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **on the Sabbath** - "on the Jewish Day of Rest?"
  * **Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteously** - Jesus implies that the people should not decide what is right, based only on what they can see. Behind the action is a motive that cannot be seen. AT: "Stop judging people according to what you see! Be more concerned with what is right according to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
