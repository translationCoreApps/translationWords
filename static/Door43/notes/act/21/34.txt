\v 34 Some in the crowd were shouting one thing and others another. Since the captain could not tell anything because of all the noise, he ordered that Paul be brought into the fortress. 
\v 35 When he came to the steps, he was carried by the soldiers because of the crowd's violence.
\v 36 For the crowd of people followed after and kept shouting out, "Away with him!"
