===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 You know how to give good things to your children, even though you are evil. So God, your Father who is in heaven, will even more certainly give good things to those who ask him.


\p
\v 12 So in whatever way you want others to act toward you, that is the way you should act toward them, because that is the meaning of God's law and of everything that the prophets wrote long ago.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Therefore, if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him?
\v 12 Therefore, whatever things you want people to do to you, you should also do to them, for this is the law and the prophets.
