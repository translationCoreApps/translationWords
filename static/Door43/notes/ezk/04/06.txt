\v 6 After that, lie down again. This time, lie on your right side for forty days. That will symbolize that the Judean people, the southern kingdom, will be punished for their sins, one year for each day that you lie there.
\v 7 Turn your face toward the drawing of Jerusalem and bare your arm like a soldier does who prepares to go into battle, and prophesy about what will happen to the city.
\v 8 You will not be able to move; it will be as though I have tied you with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished symbolizing how many years the city will be besieged.

<usfm>
\v 6 When you have completed these days, then lie down a second time on your right side, for you will carry the sin of the house of Judah for forty days. I am assigning to you one day for each year.
\v 7 Set your face toward Jerusalem that is under siege, and with your arm uncovered prophesy against it.
\v 8 For behold! I am placing bonds on you so you will not turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The Spirit continues speaking to Ezekiel.

  * **these days** - the days Ezekiel lies down on his left side to illustrate the siege of the kingdom of Israel
  * **you will carry the sin** - Possible meanings are 1) "you will be guilty of the sin" or 2) "you will be punished for the sin." Either of these meanings will be demonstrated "symbolically" by Ezekiel as noted in the UDB. Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:04|4:4]].
  * **house of Judah** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the descendants of Judah over many years. Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Judah people group" or "the people of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I am assigning to you one day for each year** - "I will make you do this one day for each year that I will punish them."
  * **Set your face toward Jerusalem** - This is a command to stare at the model of Jerusalem as a symbol of punishing Jerusalem. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:01|4:3]]. AT: "Stare at Jerusalem" or "Stare at Jerusalem so that it will be harmed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **Set your face** - Here "face" is a metonym for attention or gaze, and "Set your face" refers to literally staring at something. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **prophesy against it** - "prophesy about the bad things that will happen to Jerusalem"
  * **behold!** - "look!" or "listen!" or "pay attention to what I am about to tell you!" 
  * **I am placing bonds on you** - Bonds are ropes or chains that keep a person from moving. It is not clear whether the word "bonds" is a metaphor for something Yahweh does that is as if he had bound Ezekiel (UDB) or if he used literal, physical ropes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
