\v 10 I request that you do something for Onesimus. He is now like a son of mine because I told him about Christ here in prison.
\v 11 Although his name, as you know, means "useful," he was useless to you in the past. But now he is useful both to you and to me!
\p
\v 12 Although he is very dear to me, I am sending him back to you.
\v 13 I would like to have kept him with me, in order that he might serve me in your place. I need him because I am in prison because of my preaching the message about Christ.

\v 10 I am asking you concerning my child Onesimus, whom I have fathered in my chains.
\v 11 For he once was useless to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me.
\v 12 I have sent him back to you, he who is my very heart.
\v 13 I wish I could have kept him with me, so he could serve me for you, while I am in chains for the sake of the gospel.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Onesimus is the name of a man who apparently was Philemon's slave who had stolen something and run away.
 
  * **my child Onesimus** - "my son Onesimus." Paul speaks of the way he is friends with Onesimus as if it were the way a father and his son love each other. Onesimus was not Paul's actual son, but he received spiritual life when Paul taught him about Jesus, and Paul loved him. AT: "my spiritual son Onesimus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Onesimus** - The name "Onesimus" means "profitable" or "useful." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **whom I have fathered** - How Onesimus became like a son to Paul can be made explicit. AT: "who became my spiritual son when I taught him about Christ and he received new life" or "who became like a son to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in my chains** - Prisoners were often bound in chains. Paul was in prison when he taught Onesimus and was still in prison when he wrote this letter. AT: "while I was in prison" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I have sent him ... back to you** - Paul was probably sending Onesimus with another believer who carried this letter.
  * **who is my very heart** - Here the word "heart" is used for someone who is dearly loved. Paul was saying this about Onesimus. AT: "whom I love dearly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so he could serve me for you** - "that, since you cannot be here, he might help me" or "so that he could help me in your place"
  * **I am in chains** - "while I am in prison" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for the sake of the gospel** - "because I preach the gospel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
