  * **In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah** - It can be stated clearly that this is the seventeenth year of his reign. AT: "In year 17 of the reign of Pekah son of Remaliah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])

  * **what was right in the eyes of Yahweh his God** - The phrase "eyes of Yahweh" is a metonym for Yahweh's sight, which is a metaphor for Yahweh's judgment. AT: "what was right in Yahweh his God's judgment" or "what Yahweh his God considers to be right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
