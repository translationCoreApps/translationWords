===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here the word "him" refers to Paul.

  * **The chief captain came** - Here "came" can be translated as "went." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_go]])
  * **It was only with a large amount of money** - "It was only after I paid a lot of money to the Roman authorities." The captain makes this statement because he knows how hard it is to become a Roman citizen, and he suspects Paul is not telling truth.
  * **I acquired citizenship** - "I obtained citizenship" or "I became a citizen"
  * **I was born a Roman citizen** - If the father is a Roman citizen, then his children become Roman citizens automatically when they are born.
