\v 10 Jesus said to him, "One who has taken a bath needs only to wash his feet. The rest of his body is already clean. You are clean, but not all of you."
\v 11 He knew who was going to hand him over. That is the reason he said, "Not all of you are clean."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to speak to Simon Peter.
  * **General Information:** - Jesus uses the word "you" to refer to all of his disciples. 

  * **He who is bathed has no need, except to wash his feet** - Here "bathed" is a metaphor that means that God has cleansed a person spiritually. AT: "If anyone has already received God's forgiveness, he now only needs to receive cleansing from his daily sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Not all of you are clean** - Jesus implies that the one who will betray him, Judas, has not trusted in him. Therefore God has not forgiven him of his sins. AT: "Not all of you have received God's forgiveness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
