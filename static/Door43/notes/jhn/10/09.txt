<usfm>
\v 9 I myself am like that gate. If anyone enters through the gate and goes into the pen where the sheep are, he will be safe, and he will go out and find good pasture.
\v 10 The thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy. I have come so that they may have life and that life will be full to overflowing.

\v 9 I am the gate. If anyone enters in through me, he will be saved; he will go in and out and will find pasture.
\v 10 The thief does not come if he would not steal and kill and destroy. I have come so that they will have life and have it abundantly.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I am the gate** - Here "gate" is a metaphor. By referring to himself as "the gate," Jesus is showing that he offers a true way to enter the kingdom of God. AT: "I myself am like that gate." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **pasture** - The word "pasture" means a grassy area where sheep eat.
  * **does not come if he would not steal** - This is a double negative. In some languages it is more natural to use a positive statement. AT: "comes only to steal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]]) 
  * **steal and kill and destroy** - Here the implied metaphor is "sheep," which represents God's people. AT: "steal and kill and destroy the sheep" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so that they will have life** - The word "they" refers to the sheep. "Life" refers to eternal life. AT: "so that they will really live, lacking nothing"
