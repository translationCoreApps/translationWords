===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In Isaiah's parable, the owner of the vineyard continues to talk about his vineyard. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **remove the hedge** - "take away the border of bushes." A hedge is a row of bushes or small trees that have been planted in order to protect a garden or some other kind of area. Here "hedge" probably refers to the thorn bushes that were planted to grow on the stone wall surrounding the vineyard.
  * **I will turn it into a pasture** - "I will allow animals to go there and eat." This is a grassy place where animals feed.
  * **it will be trampled down** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "animals will trample it down" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I will lay it waste** - "I will destroy it"
  * **it will not be pruned nor hoed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one will prune it or hoe it" or "no one will cut off the branches that are not needed, and no one will take care of the soil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **briers and thorns will spring up** - Briers and thorns are often used as symbols of ruined cities and land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
