====== Isaiah 38:14-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 \add I was delirious, and\add* I chirped like a swift or a swallow,
\q2 and moaned like a dove.
\q1 My eyes became tired looking up toward heaven for help.
\q2 I cried out, 'Yahweh, help me, because I am distressed!'
\b
\q1
\v 15 But there was really nothing\f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that I could say and ask him to reply to me,
\q2 because it was Yahweh who sent this illness.
\q1 So now I will live humbly during my \add remaining\add* years
\q2 because I am very anguished in my soul.
\q1

<usfm>
\q1
\v 14 Like a swallow I chirp; I coo like a dove; 
\q1 my eyes grow tired with looking upward. Lord, I am oppressed; help me.
\q1
\v 15 What shall I say? He has both spoken to me, and has done it;
\q1 I will walk slowly all my years because I am overcome with grief.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Hezekiah continues his written prayer.

  * **Like a swallow I chirp; I coo like a dove** - Both of these clauses mean the same thing and they emphasize how sad and pitiful Hezekiah's cries were. A swallow and a dove are types of birds. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **I am oppressed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "My sickness is troubling me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **What shall I say?** - Hezekiah uses a question to emphasize he has nothing left to say. AT: "I have nothing left to say." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **because I am overcome with grief** - "because I am full of grief" or "because I am very sad"
