===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the people of Israel called out to Yahweh** - This means the people of Israel desperately asked Yahweh for help.
  * **because we abandoned our God** - The people no longer obeying and worshiping Yahweh is spoken of as if they left Yahweh and went somewhere else. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **abandoned our God** - The people are speaking to Yahweh and refer to him as "our God." This can be stated in second person. AT: "abandoned you, our God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Did I not deliver you ... Sidonians?** - God was rebuking the people of Israel for their worship of other gods. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "I was the one who delivered you ... Sidonians." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Maonites** - These are the people from the clan or family of Maon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **from their power** - Here "power" represents the Amalekites and the Maonites. AT: "from them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
