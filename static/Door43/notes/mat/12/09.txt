\v 9 After Jesus left there \add that day\add*, he went into a building where we Jews worship God.
\v 10 \add He saw\add* a man with a shriveled hand there. \add The Pharisees thought that Jesus would be disobeying the tradition about not working on the day of rest if he healed the man, so one of\add* them asked him, "Does \add God\add* permit \add us\add* to heal \add people\add* on our day of rest?" \add They asked that question\add* so that they might accuse him \add if he healed someone\add* on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f*.

\v 9 After Jesus left there that day, he went into a synagogue.
\v 10 There he saw a man with a withered hand. The Pharisees kept wanting to debate with Jesus about the Sabbath, so one of them asked him, "Does God permit us to heal people on our day of rest?" They were hoping that Jesus would commit a sin by saying something wrong.

\v 9 Then Jesus left from there and went into their synagogue.
\v 10 Behold, there was a man who had a withered hand. The Pharisees asked Jesus, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" so that they might accuse him of sinning.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here the scene shifts to a later time when the Pharisees criticize Jesus for healing a man on the Sabbath.

  * **Then Jesus left from there** - "Jesus left the grainfields" or "Then Jesus left"
  * **their synagogue** - "a synagogue." Here "their" refers to the Jews in general not just the Pharisees from the previous section.
  * **Behold** - The word "Behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **a man who had a withered hand** - "a man who had a paralyzed hand" or "a man with a crippled hand"
  * **The Pharisees asked Jesus, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" so that they might accuse him of sinning** - "The Pharisees wanted to accuse Jesus of sinning, so they asked him, 'Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?'"
  * **Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?** - "According to the law of Moses, may a person heal another person on the Sabbath?"
  * **so that they might accuse him of sinning** - They did not just want to accuse Jesus in front of the people. The Pharisees wanted Jesus to give an answer that contradicted the law of Moses so they could take him before a judge and legally charge him with breaking the law.
