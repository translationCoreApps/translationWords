  * **May he** - The word "he" refers to Yahweh.
  * **Selah** - This may be a musical term that tells people how to sing or play their instruments here. Some translations write the Hebrew word, and some translations do not include it. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:003:001|3:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  * **May he grant** - "May he give"
  * **your heart's desire** - Here "heart" stands for the entire person. The abstract noun "desire" can be stated as a verb. AT: "what you desire" or "what you want" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
