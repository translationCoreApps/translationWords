\v 3 You observe my path and my lying down;
\q you are familiar with all my ways.

  * **too much for me** - "too much for me to understand"
  * **it is too high, and I cannot reach it** - Being high and out of reach is an expression, in this case, about some knowledge that human beings cannot have. AT: "it is too difficult to understand" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
