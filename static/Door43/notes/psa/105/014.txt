===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The psalmist is writing about Israel.

  * **for their sakes** - "for their own well-being." This is referring to Israel. 
  * **Do not touch my anointed ones** - Here "touch" means to harm, it's an exaggeration Yahweh used to strengthen his warning to not harm his people. AT: "Do not harm the people I have anointed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
