====== Jeremiah 33:25-26 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 But this is what I say: 'I will not reject my people any quicker than I will change my laws that control the day and the night, the sky and the earth.
\v 26 Similarly, I will never abandon the descendants of David or the other descendants of Jacob, and I will always allow descendants of David to rule the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will bring them back to their land, and I will act mercifully toward them.'~"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 I, Yahweh, say this, 'If I have not established the covenant of day and night, and if I have not fixed the laws of heaven and earth,
\v 26 then I will reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant, and not bring from them a person to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and show mercy to them.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **If I have not established ... and if I have not fixed ... then I will reject ... and not bring** - This is a hypothetical situation that Yahweh never expects to be true. AT: "I have established ... and I have fixed ... so I will never reject ... and I will bring" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **fortunes** - "wealth"
