===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - John continues to describe the part of the vision about the seven angels with the seven plagues. The seven plagues are the seven bowls of God's wrath.

  * **I heard** - The word "I" refers to John.
  * **bowls of God's wrath** - The image of the wine in the bowls can be stated clearly. The word "wrath" here refers to punishment. The wine is a symbol for punishment. AT: "bowls full of the wine that represents God's wrath." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:15:07|15:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
