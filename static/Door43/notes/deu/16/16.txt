===== translationNotes: =====

  * **all your males must appear before Yahweh** - Females were allowed, but Yahweh did not require that they come. The men could represent their whole families.
  * **must appear before Yahweh** - "must come and stand in the presence of Yahweh"
  * **they will not appear before Yahweh empty-handed; instead, every man** - "they will not come before Yahweh without an offering; instead, every man." These two negative phrases together have a positive meaning. AT: "every person who comes before Yahweh must bring an offering. Every man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
