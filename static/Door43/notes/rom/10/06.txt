\v 6 But those whom God puts right with himself because they trust in Christâ€”to them Moses says, "No one should try to go to heaven," that is, in order to bring Christ down to us.
\v 7 Moses also says this to them: "No one should try to go down to where the dead are," that is, in order to bring Christ back from the dead for us.

\v 6 But the righteousness that comes from faith says this, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down).
\v 7 And do not say, 'Who will descend into the abyss?'" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead ones.)

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But the righteousness that comes from faith says this** - Here "righteousness" is described as a person who can speak. AT: "But Moses writes this about how faith makes a person right before God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Do not say in your heart** - Moses was addressing the people as if he were speaking to only one person. AT: "Do not say to yourself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Who will ascend into heaven?** - Moses uses a question to teach his audience. His previous instruction of, "Do not say" requires a negative answer to this question. You can translate this question as a statement. AT: "No one is able to go up to heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **that is, to bring Christ down** - "in order that they might have Christ come down to earth"
  * **Who will descend into the abyss** - Moses uses a question to teach his audience. His previous instruction of, "Do not say" requires a negative answer to this question. You can translate this as a statement. AT: "No person can go down and enter the place where the spirits of dead persons are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **that is, to bring Christ up from the dead ones** - "in order that they might bring Christ back from the dead"
  * **dead** - Here "dead" means physical death.
