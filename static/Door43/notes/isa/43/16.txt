===== translationNotes: =====

  * **who opened a way ... like a burning wick** - In these verses, Isaiah speaks of the events following the exodus from Egypt, when Yahweh divided the sea to let the Israelites walk through on dry ground but then drowned the Egyptian army. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **They fell down together; they will never rise again** - Dying is spoken of as if it were falling down to the ground. AT: "They all died together; they will never live again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **they are extinguished, quenched like a burning wick** - The people dying is spoken of as if they were burning candle wicks that someone has extinguished. This can be stated in active form. AT: "their lives have ended, like a person extinguishes the flame of a burning candle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
