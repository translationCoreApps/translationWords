\v 1 Anyway, I definitely decided that I would not come to visit you again  \add now. If I had come, I would have spoken severely to you again, and\add* I would have made you unhappy as I did the last time  \add I visited you\add*.
\v 2  \add And\add* if I make you unhappy, I will have made unhappy  \add the only people who can cheer me up\add*, so there will be none of you to cheer me up!\f + \ft Or: who would cheer me up? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 1 In the last visit I made to Corinth I know that I hurt you very much by what I said to you. I decided this time that I would not make another painful visit to you.
\v 2 I caused you much pain on my last visit, and the people who could cheer me up the most would be the same people whom I hurt when I was there.

\v 1 So I decided for my own part that I would not again come to you in painful circumstances.
\v 2 If I caused you pain, who could cheer me up but the very one who was hurt by me?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Because of his great love for them, Paul makes it clear that his rebuke in his first letter to them (the rebuke of their acceptance of the sin of immorality) caused him pain as well as pain to the church people in Corinth and the immoral man.

  * **I decided for my own part** - "I made the decision"
  * **in painful circumstances** - "in circumstances that would cause you pain" 
  * **If I caused you pain, who could cheer me up but the very one who was hurt by me?** - Paul uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that neither he nor they would benefit if his coming to them would cause them pain. AT: "If I caused you pain, the only ones who could cheer me up would be the very ones whom I had hurt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the very one who was hurt by me** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the very one whom I had hurt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
