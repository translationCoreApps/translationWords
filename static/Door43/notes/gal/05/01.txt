\v 2 Consider very carefully what I, Paul, \add an apostle\add*, now tell you: If you are permitting yourself to be circumcised \f + \ft Or:someone to circumcise you \f*, what Christ \add has done for you\add* will not benefit you at all.

<usfm>
\v 1 Christ set us free from the law so that it may control us no longer. So stop anyone who says you are still slaves to the law, and do not let the law control you like slaves again.
\v 2 Consider very carefully what I, Paul, an apostle, now tell you. If you let anyone circumcise you, what Christ has done for you will not help you at all!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul applies the allegory by reminding the believers to use their liberty in Christ because all the law is fulfilled in loving neighbors as ourselves.

  * **It is for freedom** - The translation needs to emphasize "freedom" in contrast with the slavery talked about in the previous verses.
  * **It is for freedom that Christ has set us free** - "It is so that we can be free that Christ has set us free"
  * **stand firm** - This can be stated "stay where you are," even though people are trying to force you to move.
  * **if you become circumcised** - Paul is using "circumcision" as a metonym for Judaism. AT: "if you return to the Jewish religion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
