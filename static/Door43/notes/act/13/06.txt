\v 6 When they had gone through the whole island to Paphos, they found a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, whose name was Bar Jesus.
\v 7 This magician associated with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, because he wanted to hear the word of God.
\v 8 But Elymas "the magician" (that is how his name is translated) opposed them; he tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
