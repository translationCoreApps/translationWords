\v 29 It happened at midnight that Yahweh attacked all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on his throne, to the firstborn of the person in prison and all the firstborn of cattle.
\v 30 Pharaoh got up in the nightâ€”he, all his servants, and all the Egyptians. There was loud lamenting in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not someone dead.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **at midnight** - "in the middle of the night"
  * **all the firstborn in the land of Egypt ... all the firstborn of cattle** - Here, "firstborn" always refers to the oldest male offspring. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:11:04|11:5]].
  * **who sat on his throne** - This refers to Pharaoh.
  * **the firstborn of the person in prison** - "to the firstborn of people in prison." This refers to prisoners, in general, and not to a specific person in prison.
  * **There was loud lamenting in Egypt** - This can be stated with a verbal form. AT: "All the Egyptians cried loudly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **for there was not a house where there was not someone dead** - This double negative emphasizes the positive. AT: "because someone was dead in every house" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
