====== Romans 15:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Most of us are sure \add that God will not punish us for doing certain things that the laws and rituals God gave Moses said the Jews should not do. But we\add* should be patient with those who are uncertain \add about such things\add*, and we should not let them irritate us. We should not \add simply\add* please ourselves.
\v 2 Each of us should \add do the things that\add* please the fellow \add believers with whom we come in contact, and things that will\add* benefit them. \add We should do those things\add* in order to help them mature \add spiritually\add*.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Those of us believers who are sure that God allows us to do many more things than other believers think he allows them to doâ€”we should be patient with them and allow them to inconvenience us. This is more important than our pleasing ourselves.
\v 2 Each of us should do the things that please our fellow believers, and things that will help them, things that will encourage them to trust in Christ.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

\p
\v 1 Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and ought not to please ourselves.
\v 2 Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, in order to build him up.
