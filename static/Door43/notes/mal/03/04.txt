\pi "At that time, I will come to you to judge you. I will quickly testify against all those who practice sorcery, against those who mistreat helpless widows and orphans, against those who do not treat the foreigners among you justly, and against those who refuse to honor me."

\v 4 Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to Yahweh, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.
\v 5 "Then I will approach you for judgment. I will quickly become a witness against the sorcerers, the adulterers, the false witnesses, and against those who oppress the hired worker in his wages, those who oppress the widow and the fatherless, against those who turn away the foreigner, and against those who do not honor me," says Yahweh of hosts.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Malachi continues speaking in verse 4, but Yahweh begins speaking again in verse 5.

  * **the offering of Judah and Jerusalem** - Here "Judah" and "Jerusalem" stand for the people in those places. AT: "the offerings brought by the people of Judah and Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **as in the days of old, and as in ancient years** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the offering was once pleasing to Yahweh. AT: "as it was in the distant past" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **Then I will approach you for judgment** - Here "judgment" refers to the act of judging. AT: "Then I will approach you in order to judge you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **oppress the hired worker in his wages** - "cause the hired worker to suffer by not paying him for his work" 
  * **turn away the foreigner** - That is, turning away the foreigner from gaining his rights. Depriving people of their rights is spoken of as if it were physically turning them away from oneself. Perhaps the idea is turning away someone who comes for a wrong to be set right. AT: "deny foreigners living in Israel the rights that they should have" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
