\v 19 If the person who set apart the field for Yahweh later wants to buy it back, he must pay to the priest the price that the priest says it is worth, plus an added one fifth, and then the field will belong to that man again.
\v 20 However, if he does not buy it back, or if it has been sold to someone else, he will never be permitted to buy it back again.
\v 21 In the year of the celebration of Jubilee, it will be permanently set apart as a holy gift for Yahweh, and it will be given to the priest.

\v 19 If the man who set apart the field wishes to redeem it, then he must add a fifth to the valuation, and it will be become his again.
\v 20 If he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it cannot be redeemed any more. 
\v 21 Instead, the field, when it is released in the  year of Jubilee, will be a holy gift to Yahweh, like the field that has been completely given to Yahweh. It will belong to the priest.
