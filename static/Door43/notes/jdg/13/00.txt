== Warning not to cut his hair ==

The angel of the Lord prophesied about Samson and gave instructions to Samson's mother. Samson's mother was to offer up her son under a Nazarite vow. This was a special type of vow, dedicating Samson to Yahweh. Part of this vow prohibited the cutting of the person's hair. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:vow]])
