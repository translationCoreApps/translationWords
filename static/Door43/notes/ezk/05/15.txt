\v 15 They will scorn you and taunt you. When I severely punish you because of my great anger, they will be horrified and you will be a warning to them. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it.
\v 16 And when I cut off your food supply and cause there to be more famine, it will be as though I am shooting at you with my arrows that will destroy you.
\v 17 So I will cause you to experience a famine, and I will send wild beasts to attack you and your children, and all your children will be killed. You will experience plagues and wars, and I will cause your enemies to attack you with their swords. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it."

<usfm>
\v 15 So Jerusalem will become something for other people to condemn and to mock, a warning and a horror to the nations that surround you. I will execute judgments against you in wrath and fury, and with a furious rebuke—I, Yahweh have declared this!
\v 16 I will send out harsh arrows of famine against you that will become the means with which I will destroy you. For I will increase the famine on you and break your staff of bread.
\v 17 I will send a famine and disasters against you so you will be childless. Plague and blood will pass through you, and I will bring a sword against you—I, Yahweh, have declared this."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel and Judah.

  * **in wrath and fury** - The words "wrath" and "fury" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh is very angry. AT: "because I will be very angry with you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **will send out harsh arrows of famine against you** - The word "arrows" is a metonym for the sharp pains that people feel when they have had no food for a long time. AT: "will make you feel the pain of intense hunger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **increase the famine on you** - "make the famine more severe for you" or "make the famine last longer for you" or "make sure that there is less and less for you to eat"
  * **break your staff of bread** - A "staff" was something that people leaned upon to support them. This phrase is a metaphor for means removing the supply of food that the people were depending upon. See how "staff of bread" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:16|4:16]]. AT: "cut off your food supply" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Plague and blood will pass through you** - Sickness and violent death are spoken of as if they were soldiers going through the city killing everyone they could. AT: "Many people will die of disease, and many others will die in war" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **I will bring a sword against you** - The word "sword" is a metonym for killing people using a sword. AT: "I myself will cause you to die a violent death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
