\v 6 But when you ask God, trust him to answer you. Do not doubt that he will answer and always help you, because people who keep doubting God cannot follow him, like a wave of the sea that is blown back and forth by the wind and thus cannot continue in the same direction.
\v 7 Indeed, people who doubt should not think that the Lord God will do anything that they request him to do.
\v 8 For they are people who cannot decide whether they will follow Jesus or not follow Jesus. These people do not do what they say they will do.

\v 6 But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing. For anyone who doubts is like a wave in the sea that is driven by the wind and tossed around.
\v 7 For that person must not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.
\v 8 Such a person is double-minded, unstable in all his ways.
