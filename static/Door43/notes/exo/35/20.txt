\v 20 Then all the tribes of Israel left and went away from Moses's presence.
\v 21 Everyone whose heart stirred him up and whom his spirit made willing came and brought an offering to Yahweh for the construction of the tabernacle, for all the items of service in it, and for the holy garments.
\v 22 They came, both men and women, all who had a willing heart. They brought brooches, earrings, rings, and ornaments, all kinds of gold jewelry. They all presented offerings of gold as a wave offering to Yahweh.
