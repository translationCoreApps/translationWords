\v 6 When the trumpets are blown loudly the second time, the tribes that are to the south should start to move. The loud blasts on the trumpet will signal that they should start to move.
\v 7 When you want only to gather the people together, blow the trumpets, but do not blow them as loudly.
\p
\v 8 The priests who are descended from Aaron are the ones who should blow the trumpets. That is a regulation that will never be changed.

  * **When you blow a loud signal** - Here the word "you" is plural. Yahweh is speaking to Moses, but he is referring to the priests. The priests will blow the trumpets, Moses will not. AT: "When they blow a loud signal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **When the community gathers together** - "To gather the community together"
  * **second** - "2nd" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **They must blow a loud signal for their journeys** - "They" refers to the priests and the word "their" refers to the people of Israel.
  * **be a regulation for you** - "be a rule for you." Here  "you" is plural and refers to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
