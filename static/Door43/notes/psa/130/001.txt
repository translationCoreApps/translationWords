===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **song of ascents** - Possible meanings are 1) "song people sang while going up to Jerusalem for a celebration" or 2) "song people sang while going up the steps into the temple" or 3) "song whose words are like steps." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:120:001|120:1]]
  * **Out of the depths** - The author's sadness is spoken of as if it were a container. His sadness comes from the bottom of the container. Sadness is often spoken of as being a container that fills from the top to the bottom. AT: "Because I am very sad," (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **let your ears be attentive** - The ears represent Yahweh, but because the author knows that Yahweh hears everything, he is really asking for Yahweh to respond. AT: "please listen" or "please respond" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **to my pleas for mercy** - "Mercy" is not something that can physically be given to anyone. The author is asking for Yahweh to be merciful to him. AT: "to my pleas and be merciful to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
