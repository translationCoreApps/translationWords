\v 27 Furthermore, if \add it is true that\add* Satan enables me to expel demons, is it also true that your disciples \add who\add* expel demons\add do so\add* by\add Satan's\add* power \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \add No\add*!

<usfm>
\v 26 In the same way, if Satan were driving out his own demons, he would be fighting against himself. He will not be able to continue to rule over his servants!
\v 27 Furthermore, if it is true that Satan enables me to drive out demons, is it also true that your disciples who drive them out do so by Satan's power? No! So they will judge you for saying that Satan's power was behind their work.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
\v 27 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? For this reason they will be your judges.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to respond to the Pharisees' accusation that he healed the man by the power of Satan.

  * **If Satan drives out Satan** - The second use of Satan refers to the demons that serve Satan. AT: "If Satan works against his own demons" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Satan ... Beelzebul** - Both names refer to the same person.
  * **How then will his kingdom stand?** - Jesus uses a question to challenge the Pharisees. AT: "Satan's kingdom cannot stand" or "Satan's kingdom will not last" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **by whom do your sons drive them out?** - Jesus uses another question to challenge the Pharisees. AT: "then you must say your followers also drive out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But, you know this is not true".  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **your sons** - Jesus was speaking to the Pharisees. The phrase "your sons" refers to their followers. This was a common way of referring to those who follow teachers or leaders. AT: "your followers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For this reason they will be your judges** - "Because your followers cast out demons by the power of God, they prove that you are wrong about me."
