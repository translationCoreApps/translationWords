\v 3 I personally would be willing to let \add God\add* curse me \add and, as a result, be separated\add* from Christ \add if that would\add* help my fellow Israelites, my natural kinsmen, \add to believe in Christ\add*.
\v 4 We \add Jews\add* are \add Israelites, God's chosen\add* descendants of \add Jacob\add*. \add God has always considered\add* us as his children \f + \ft metaphor \f*. It was to our ancestors \add that he used to appear\add* gloriously \add while they were in the desert\add*. It was with them that \add God made\add* covenants \add several times\add*. It was to them \add that God\add* gave the laws \add at Mount Sinai\add*. They were the ones \add to whom God showed how they should\add* worship him. They were the ones \add to whom God\add* promised many things, \add especially that the Messiah would come from their race\add*.
\v 5 It was our ancestors, \add Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whom God chose to found our nation\add*. And, \add most importantly\add*, it was from us Israelites that the Messiah received his human nature. \add Nevertheless, most of my fellow Israelites have rejected Christ\add*, who is the one who controls all things! He is God, the one who is worthy that we praise him forever! This is true! \f + \ft Or: Amen! \f*

\v 3 I personally would be willing to let God curse me and, keep me apart from Christ forever if that would help my fellow Israelites, my natural kinsmen, to believe in Christ.
\v 4 They, like me, are Israelites. God chose them to be his children. It is to them that he showed how wonderful he is. It is with them that he made the covenants. It is to them that he gave the law. They are the ones who have the worship of God. They are the ones to whom God promised many things.
\v 5 It was our ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whom God chose to begin our nation. And, most importantly, it was from us Israelites that the Christ was born as a human being. He is God, the one who is worthy that we praise him forever! This is true!

\v 3 For I could wish that I myself would be cursed and set apart from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race according to the flesh.
\v 4 They are Israelites. They have adoption, the glory, the covenants, the gift of the law, the worship of God, and the promises.
\v 5 Theirs are the ancestors from whom Christ has come with respect to the fleshâ€”he who is God over all. May he be praised forever. Amen.
