====== Psalm 010 General Notes ======


=== Type of psalm ===

Psalm 10 is a psalm of deliverance. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:deliverer]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Evil people ==
The wicked people are prospering and think that God does not care. They think that he is not involved in these affairs. They destroy the innocent. The godly need God to come to their rescue and to punish the wicked people for the evil that they are doing to the good people. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:evil]], [[:en:obe:kt:innocent]], [[:en:obe:kt:godly]] and [[:en:obe:kt:good]])

== Second half of Psalm 9 ==

As noted in the intro to the last Psalm, this one is part of an acrostic poem. This Psalm covers the last half on the Hebrew alphabet. It also does not have a superscription to introduce it. However, the Psalms do separate well on the subjects they address. One addresses thanksgiving and praise whereas Psalm 10 is a lament. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lament]])
