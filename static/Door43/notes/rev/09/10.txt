===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They had tails** - The word "They" refers to the locusts.
  * **with stingers like scorpions** - A scorpion is a small insect with a poisonous stinger at the end of its long tail. The sting can cause severe pain or even death. "with stingers like scorpion stingers" or "with stingers that could cause terrible pain as scorpion stingers can." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:09:05|9:6]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **in their tails they had power to harm people for five months** - Possible meanings are 1) they had power for five months to harm people or 2) they could sting people and the people would be in pain for five months.
  * **the bottomless pit** - This is an extremely deep narrow hole. Possible meanings are 1) the pit has no bottom; it continues to go down further forever or 2) the pit is so deep that it is as if it had no bottom. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:09:01|9:1]].
  * **Abaddon ... Apollyon** - Both names mean "destruction." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  * **there are still two disasters to come** - Existing in the future is spoken of as coming. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
