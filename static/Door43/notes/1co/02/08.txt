====== 1 Corinthians 02:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 None of those who rule this world knew that wise plan. If they had known it, they would not have nailed our wonderful Lord to the cross.
\v 9 But  \add we believers need to remember these words that a prophet\add* wrote  \add in the Scriptures\add*:
\q Things that no one has ever seen,
\q things that no one ever heard,
\q things that no one ever thought could happen,
\q those are the things that God has prepared for those who love him.

<usfm>
\v 8 None of those who rule this world knew about God's wise plans. If they had understood them, they never would have nailed the Lord, the one who is so very great, to the cross.
\v 9 But in the scriptures it says:
\q "The things that no one has seen,
\q that no one has heard,
\q and that no one could imagine—
\q these are what God has prepared for those who love him."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 None of the rulers of this age knew this wisdom, for if they had understood it at that time, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
\v 9 But as it is written,
\q "Things that no eye has seen,
\q1 no ear has heard,
\q no mind has imagined,
\q1 the things that God has prepared for those who love him."

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **the Lord of glory** - "Jesus, the glorious Lord"
  * **Things that no eye ... imagined, the things ... who love him** - This is an incomplete sentence. Some translations make it a complete sentence: "Things that no eye ... imagined; these are the things ... who love him." Others leave it incomplete but show that it is incomplete by using non-final punctuation here and beginning the next verse as a continuation of this verse: "'Things that no eye ... imagined, the things ... who love him'—"
  * **Things that no eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has imagined** - This is a triplet referring to all parts of a person to emphasize that no man has ever been aware of the things that God has prepared. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the things that God has prepared for those who love him** - The Lord has created in heaven wonderful surprises for those who love him.
