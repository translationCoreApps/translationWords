\v 1 Because of that, \add if anyone should ask\add*, "Has God rejected his people \add the Jews?" I would declare that\add* he certainly has not \add rejected all of us! You can realize that by remembering that\add* I also belong to the \add people of\add* Israel. I am a descendant of Abraham, and I belong to the tribe of Benjamin, \add but God has not rejected me!\add*
\v 2 No, God has not rejected his people, whom he chose long ago \add to be people whom he would bless in a special way\add*. Remember \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what is written \f + \ft personification \f* in the Scriptures about Elijah when he \add mistakenly\add* complained to God about \add the people of\add* Israel, saying:
\v 3 "Lord, they have killed \add the rest of\add* your\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* prophets, they have destroyed your altars. I am the only one \add who believes in you\add* who remains \add alive\add*, and now they are trying to kill me!"

\v 1 If I should ask, "Has God rejected his people the Jews?" The answer would be, "Certainly not! Remember that I also belong to the people of Israel. I am a descendant of Abraham, and I belong to the tribe of Benjamin, but God has not rejected me!
\v 2 No, God has not rejected his people, whom he chose long ago to be people whom he would bless in a special way. Remember that Elijah mistakenly complained to God about the people of Israel, as the scriptures say:
\v 3 "Lord, they have killed the rest of your prophets, and they have destroyed your altars. I am the only one who believes in you who remains alive, and now they are trying to kill me!"

\v 1 I say then, did God reject his people? May it never be. For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
\v 2 God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleaded with God against Israel?
\v 3 "Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Though Israel as a nation has rejected God, God wants them to understand salvation comes by grace without works.

  * **I say then** - "I, Paul, say then"
  * **did God reject his people?** - Paul asks this question so that he can answer the questions of other Jews who are upset that God has included the Gentiles among his people, while the hearts of the Jewish people have been hardened. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **May it never be** - "That is not possible!" or "Certainly not!" This expression strongly denies that this could happen. You may have a similar expression in your language that you could use here. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:09:14|9:14]].
  * **tribe of Benjamin** - This refers to the tribe descended from Benjamin, one of the 12 tribes into which God divided the people of Israel.
  * **whom he foreknew** - "whom he knew ahead of time"
  * **Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleaded with God against Israel?** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "Surely you know what the Scriptures record about when Elijah pleaded with God against Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **what the scripture says** - Paul is referring to the Scriptures as if they were able to speak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
