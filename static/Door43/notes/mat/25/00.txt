== The parable of the ten virgins ==

Among the Jews, when a marriage was arranged, there was a period of time before the wedding. At the end of this time, the young man would go to his bride's house, where she was waiting for him. The wedding ceremony would then take place. With great celebration they would then travel to the groom's home, where there would be a feast. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_apocalypticwriting]])

Jesus makes use of these customs to tell his parable of the ten virgins ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:25:01|25:1-13]]).
