\v 11 If I had done something bad \add for which I\add* should be executed \f + \ft Or:\add concerning which the law said that they\add* should execute me \f*, I would not plead \add with them that they\add* not kill me. But none of these things about which they accuse me is \add true, so\add* no one can \add legally\add* surrender me to \add these Jews\add*. So I formally request that the emperor \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add should judge me at Rome\add*."
\v 12 Then after Festus conferred with the \add men who regularly\add* advised him, he replied to Paul, "You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* have formally requested \add that I should send you\add* to the emperor \add in Rome. So I will arrange for\add* you to go there\add in order that he can judge you\add*."

\v 11 If I had done anything deserving of death, I would not refuse to to die; but there is nothing that they accuse me of that deserves such a punishment. No one can condemn me just to satisfy them. I ask that Caesar himself judge me."
\v 12 After Festus conferred with his advisors, he said, "You have appealed to Caesar, and so to Caesar you shall go!"

\v 11 Though if I have done wrong and if I have done what is worthy of death, I do not refuse to die. But if their accusations are nothing, no one may hand me over to them. I call upon Caesar."
\v 12 After Festus talked with the council, he answered, "You called upon Caesar; you will go to Caesar."

  * [[:en:obe:other:caesar]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:council]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Though if I have done wrong ... no one may hand me over to them** - Paul is stating a hypothetical situation. If he were guilty, he would accept the punishment, but he knows that he is not guilty. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **if I have done what is worthy of death** - "if I have done some wrong that deserves the death penalty"
  * **if their accusations are nothing** - "if the charges against me are not true"
  * **no one may hand me over to them** - Possible meanings are 1) Festus does not have the legal authority to hand Paul over to these false accusers or 2) Paul was saying that if he has done nothing wrong, the governor should not give into the request of the Jews.
  * **I call upon Caesar** - "I ask that I go before Caesar so he can judge me"
  * **with the council** - This is not the Sanhedrin that is referred to as "council" throughout Acts. This is a political council in the Roman government. AT: "with his own government advisors"
