===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 \add Some people say\add*, "\add God\add* permits \add believers to do\add* anything." But \add I say that\add* not everything that people do benefits \add those who do it! Yes, some people say\add*, "God permits \add believers to do\add* all things." But not everything that people do helps them to become \add spiritually\add* mature.
\v 24 No one should try to benefit \add only\add* himself. Instead, each person should try to benefit other people \add spiritually\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 Some say, "Everything is lawful," but not everything is for our good or for the good of other people. Yes, "everything is lawful," but not everything helps people to grow strong in their life with God.
\v 24 Do not work for your good only, but also for the good of other people. All of us must act toward everyone in such a way as to help them all.

\v 23 "Everything is lawful," but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is lawful," but not everything builds people up.

===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:other:lawful]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:neighbor]]

===== translationNotes: ===== 

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul again reminds them of the law of liberty and doing everything for the benefit of others.

  * **Everything is lawful** - Possible meanings are 1) Paul is answering what some Corinthians might be thinking, "Some say, 'I can do anything'" or 2) Paul is actually saying what he thinks is true, "God allows me to do anything." This should be translated as in [[:en:bible:notes:1co:06:12|6:12]].
  * **builds people up** - Paul speaks of helping people as if it were building a house. AT: "helps people." See how "builds up" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:1co:08:01|8:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
