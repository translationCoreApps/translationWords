\b
\q1
\v 20 \add It is as though\add* the place where the dead people are is always wanting more people to \add die and\add* come there;
\q2 and humans \f + \ft synecdoche \f* are always wanting to acquire more things, too.
\b
\q1
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 When a person looks in the water, he sees his own face;
\q2 similarly when we look at what a person loves, we know what he is like deep inside.
\q1
\v 20 You know that the Place of the Dead and The Destroyer are never satisfied;
\q2 and people, too, are never satisfied and always want more.

\q1
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 19 Just as water reflects a person's face,
\q so a person's heart reflects the person.
\q
\v 20 Just as Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied,
\q so a man's eyes are never satisfied.
</usfm>
