  * [[:en:obe:other:tent]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:gibeah]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:lots]]
===== translationNotes: =====

  * **as one** - This simile speaks of the group as acting as a single person. They all acted together in exactly the same way. AT: "as if they were a single man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **None of us will go to his tent ... none of us will return to his house** - These two clauses say basically the same thing twice for emphasis. They can be combined. The words "none ... go" and "none ... return" emphasizes how the people will continue to stay there. They can be stated in positive form. AT: "We will all stay here" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **But now** - These words introduce the main portion of what the people say after the initial exclamation.
  * **as the lot directs** - This involved tossing or rolling small marked stones to determine what God wants.
