  * **General Information:** - Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])

  * **if I have said to fine gold, 'You are what I am confident in'** - This line means the same thing as the previous line. Together they emphasize that Job has not trusted in wealth to bring him security. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **my hand had gotten many possessions** - AT: "I have gained many possessions by my own ability" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
