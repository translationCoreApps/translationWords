\v 26 In the same way, the Spirit also helps in our weakness. For we do not know how we should pray, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groans.
\v 27 He who searches the hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes on behalf of the believers according to the will of God.
