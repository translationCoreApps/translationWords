\q
\v 1 Now come together in battle ranks,
\q daughter of soldiers;
\q the soldiers have set up a siege around city,
\q with a rod they will strike the judge of Israel
\q on the cheek.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa come together in battle ranks \fqa* , some interpreters translate \fqa cut yourselves \fqa* , referring to the pagan practice of cutting oneself while praying to idols. Also, some modern versions follow an ancient version that reads \fqa build up your fortifications  \fqa* . \f*
