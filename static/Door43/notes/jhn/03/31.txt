====== John 03:31-33 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 \add Jesus\add* came from heaven. He is more important than anyone else. Those who are born from \add parents here\add* on earth \f + \ft metonymy \f* are just humans, and they speak about things \add that happen here\add* on the earth. But since he came from heaven, his \add words are\add* more important than anyone else's.
\v 32 He tells people what he has seen and what he heard \add in heaven\add*, but very few people \f + \ft hyperbole \f* listen to what he says.
\v 33 Those who have accepted what he has said verify that what God has said is true.

<usfm>
\v 31 Jesus comes from heaven, and he is higher in position than anyone else. We have our home on earth, and we can speak only of things that belong to the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above everyone on the earth and everything there is.
\v 32 Now there is one here who gives his testimony to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts what he says or trusts it to be true.
\v 33 However, those who have trusted in what he said, they testify that God is the source of all truth, and that he alone is the measure and standard of everything that is true.

\v 31 He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks about the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.
\v 32 He testifies about what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.
\v 33 He who has received his testimony has confirmed that God is true.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He who comes from above is above all** - "He who comes from heaven is more important than anyone"
  * **He who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks about the earth** - John means that Jesus is greater than he is since Jesus is from heaven, and John was born on the earth. AT: "He who is born in this world is like everyone else who lives in the world and he speaks about what happens in this world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He who comes from heaven is above all** - This means the same thing as the first sentence. John repeats this for emphasis.
  * **He testifies about what he has seen and heard** - John is speaking about Jesus. AT: "The one from heaven tells about what he has seen and heard in heaven."
  * **no one accepts his testimony** - Here John exaggerates to emphasize that only a few people believe Jesus. AT: "very few people believe him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]) 
  * **He who has received his testimony** - "Anyone who believes what Jesus says"
  * **has confirmed** - "proves" or "agrees"
