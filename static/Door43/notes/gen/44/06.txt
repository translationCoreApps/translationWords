  * **spoke these words to them** - Here "words" stands for what was said. AT: "spoke what Joseph told him to say" 
  * **Why does my master speak such words as these?** - Here "words" stands for what was said. The brothers refer to the steward as "my master." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with greater authority. It can be stated in the second person. AT: "Why are you saying this, my master?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Far be it from your servants that they would do such a thing** - The brothers refer to themselves as "your servants" and "they." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with greater authority. AT: "We would never do such a thing!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Far be it from your servants** - Something that a person would never do is spoken of as if it were an object that person wants to put very far from himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
