\v 5 When it was time to offer those sacrifices, I was still sitting there, wearing those torn clothes and mourning\f + \ft Or: sad \f*. I stood up, and then I quickly prostrated myself on the ground. I lifted up my hands to Yahweh, my God,
\v 6 and this is what I prayed:
\pi "Yahweh my God, I am very ashamed to raise my head in front of you. The sins that we Israelites have committed \add are very great; it is as though they\add* have risen up higher than our heads, and our guilt \add for committing those sins, it is as though it\add* rises up to the heavens.

\v 5 But at the evening offering I arose from my position of humiliation in my torn clothes and robe, and knelt down and spread my hands to Yahweh my God.
\v 6 I said, 'My God, I am ashamed and disgraced to raise my face to you, for our iniquities increase over our head, and our guilt grows to the heavens.
