\v 8 \add When you are in that land\add*, you must not do some of the things that we have been doing. Until now, you have all been worshiping \add Yahweh\add* the way you wanted to,

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 When you are in that land, you must not do some of the things that we have been doing. Until now, you have all been worshiping Yahweh the way you want to,
\v 9 because you have not yet arrived in the land which he will allow you to permanently possess, where you will be able to live peacefully.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 You will not do all the things that we are doing here today; now everyone is doing whatever is right in his own eyes;
\v 9 for you have not yet come to the rest, to the inheritance that Yahweh your God is giving you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You will not do all the things that we are doing here today** - "You will not do as we are doing here today." This means that they would worship in the promised land differently than the way they were worshiping at that moment. 
  * **now everyone is doing whatever is right in his own eyes** - Here "eyes" represents a person's thoughts or opinions. AT: "everyone is doing what he considers to be right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to the rest** - The abstract noun "the rest" can be stated as a verb. AT: "to the land where you will rest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **to the inheritance that Yahweh your God is giving you** - The land that God is giving to the people of Israel is spoken of as if it were a possession that a father leaves as an inheritance for his children. AT: "to the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you as a permanent possession" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
