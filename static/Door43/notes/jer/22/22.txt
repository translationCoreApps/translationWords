\q
\v 22 The wind will shepherd away all your shepherds, and your friends will go into captivity.
\q Then you will certainly be ashamed and humiliated by all of your evil deeds.
\q
\v 23 You who live in 'Lebanon,' who is nestled in cedar buildings,
\q how you will be pitied when the labor pains come upon you, pain like that of a woman in labor!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The wind will shepherd away all your shepherds** - This is a wordplayâ€”Yahweh uses the idea of "shepherd" in two different ways. Here "shepherds" is a metonym for the leaders of Jerusalem, and the wind "leads" them away. The wind represents Yahweh.  AT: "I will take your leaders away if if the wind had blown them away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **go into captivity** - "be taken away as captives" or "go into exile"
  * **You who live in 'Lebanon,' who are nestled in cedar buildings** - Yahweh speaks of the royal palace as "Lebanon" and "cedar buildings" because it was constructed with a lot of cedar. AT: "You who live in a palace made from the cedars of Lebanon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You who live** - This "You" is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **how you will be pitied** - The meaning of the Hebrew is not clear. Possible meanings are 1) "they will greatly pity you" or 2) "you groan greatly."
  * **when the labor pains come on you, pain like that of a woman in labor** - The pain that the king will feel when he is defeated will be as intense as the pain woman feels in childbirth. AT: "when you experience pain as intense as the pain of a woman in childbirth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
