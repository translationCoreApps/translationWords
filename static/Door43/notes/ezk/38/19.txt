\v 19 In my zeal and in the fire of my anger, I declare that on that day there will be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
\v 20 They will shake before meâ€”the fish of the sea and the birds of the skies, the beasts of the fields, and all the creatures that crawl on the earth, and every person who is on the surface of the land. The mountains will be thrown down and the cliffs will fall, until every wall falls to the earth.
