\v 1 Here are more wise sayings of Solomon that were written down by the men of Hezekiah, the king of Judah.
\q1
\v 2 God honors himself when he hides something so people cannot know it.
\q2 But it is to the honor of kings to search out the things that God has hidden.

\v 3 What kings think is above the way peasants think; they are like the heavens, they are above us all;

\c 25
\p
\v 1 These are more proverbs of Solomon, copied by the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah.
\q
\v 2 It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,
\q but the glory of kings to search it out.
\q
\v 3 Like the heavens are for height and the earth is for depth,
\q so the heart of kings is unsearchable.
