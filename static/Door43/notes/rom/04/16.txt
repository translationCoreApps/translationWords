\v 16 So it is because \add we\add* trust \add in God that we will receive the things that he has promised\add*. \add It is not because we perfectly obey God's laws. He wants\add* to \add erase the record of our sins\f + \ft Or: to declare us no longer guilty\add* \f* without our earning it. As a result, what God now promises, he guarantees to give to all people who are \add Abraham's spiritual\add* descendants. \add He promises to do that not only for us Jewish believers\add*, who \add have\add* God's laws \add and trust in him as Abraham did\add*, but also for those \add non-Jews who do not have God's laws but\add* who trust \add in him\add* as Abraham did. Abraham is the \add spiritual\add* ancestor of all of us \add believers\add*.
\v 17 What is written \f + \ft Or:What \add Moses\add* wrote \f* \add in the Scriptures about what God promised Abraham shows that this is true\add*. \add God said to him\add*, "It is in order that you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* may be the ancestor of many ethnic groups that I have appointed you."


\p God \add guaranteed that he would give Abraham many descendants\add*. Abraham confidently believed that God \add would do that\add*,

\v 16 So it is because we trust in God that we will receive the things that he has promised to us as a gift, because he is very kind. He gives these things to everyone whom he regards as a true descendant of Abraham—us Jewish believers, who have God's law and trust him, and also those non-Jews who do not have God's laws but who trust in him as Abraham did. For God regards Abraham as the true ancestor of all of us believers.
\v 17 This is what God said to Abraham in the scriptures: "I will make you the ancestor of many ethnic groups." Abraham received this directly from God who raises dead people to life and creates things out of nothing.

\v 16 For this reason it is by faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all of Abraham's descendants—not only to those who are under the law, but also to those who share the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all, 
\v 17 as it is written, "I have made you the father of many nations." Abraham was in the presence of him whom he trusted, that is, God, who gives life to the dead and calls the things that do not exist into existence.
