\v 3 King Zedekiah had put me there. I continued to prophesy there \add about what would happen\add*. I continued to say, "Yahweh says that he is about to allow \add the army of\add* the king of Babylon to capture this city \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\v 4 And the soldiers of Babylonia will capture King Zedekiah and take him to\f + \ft Or: put him in the hands of \f* the king of Babylon.
\v 5 Then his \add soldiers\add* will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will remain there until I arrange for him to be punished. And if he tries to fight against the soldiers from Babylonia, he will not succeed." King Zedekiah asked me why I continued to say that.

\v 3 King Zedekiah had put me there. I continued to prophesy there about what would happen. I continued to say, "Yahweh says that he is about to allow the army of the king of Babylon to capture this city.
\v 4 And the soldiers of Babylonia will most definitely capture King Zedekiah and take him to the king of Babylon for a face to face encounter.
\v 5 Then his soldiers will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will remain there until I arrange for him to be punished. And if he tries to fight against the soldiers from Babylonia, he will not succeed." King Zedekiah asked Jeremiah why he continued to say that, but Yahweh had said this would be so.

\v 3 Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him and said, "Why do you prophesy and say, 'Yahweh says this: Look, I am about to give over this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.
\v 4 Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, for he will certainly be been given into the hand of the king of Babylon. His mouth will speak to the king's mouth, and his eyes will see the king's eyes.
\v 5 He will take Zekediah to Babylon, and he will remain there until I have dealt with himâ€”this is Yahweh's declaration. Though you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him** - It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people helped Zedekiah do this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **had imprisoned him** - It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. You may translate using first person, as the UDB does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Why do you prophesy and say** - Zekekiah uses a question to rebuke Jeremiah. AT: "It is wrong for you to continue prophesying and saying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it** - Here "hand" refers to power or control. AT: "to the king of Babylon, and his army will capture it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for he will certainly be given** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "for I will indeed give him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **His mouth will speak to the king's mouth, and his eyes will see the king's eyes** - AT: "Zedekiah himself will see and directly speak with Nebuchadnezzar" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **you fight** - Here "you" is plural and refers to the people in Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
