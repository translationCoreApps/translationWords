===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **Yahweh will establish you as a people that is set apart for himself** - Yahweh choosing the people of Israel to belong to him in a special way is spoken of as if Yahweh put them in a place different from the place all other nations live in. AT: "Yahweh will make you a holy people that belongs to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you are called by the name of Yahweh** - Here the metonym "called by the name of Yahweh" means belonging to him. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh has called you his own" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
