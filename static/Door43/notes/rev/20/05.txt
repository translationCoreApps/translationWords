\v 5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.

  * **the thousand years were ended** - "the end of the 1,000 years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Over these the second death has no power** - Here John describes "death" as a person with power. AT: "These people will not experience the second death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])

AT: "the final death in the lake of fire." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:02:10|2:11]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
