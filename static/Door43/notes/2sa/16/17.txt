  * **loyalty** - a strong feeling of support and love
  * **Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with him?** - These rhetorical questions are asked to criticize Hushai. They can be translated as a statement. AT: "You have been loyal to David, so you should be with him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the one whom Yahweh** - Here "the one" is a metony and stands for Absalom. This can be translated "Absalom, whom Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
