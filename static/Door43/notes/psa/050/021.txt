===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 You did all those things, and I did not say anything to you,
\q2 so you thought that I was \add a sinner\add* just like you.
\q1 But now I rebuke you and accuse you, right in front of you.
\b
\q1
\v 22 So, all you who have ignored me, pay attention to this,
\q1 because if you do not, I will tear you to pieces,
\q2 and there will be no one to rescue you.

\q
\v 21 You have done these things, but I have kept silent,
\q so you thought that I was someone just like yourself.
\q But I will reprove you and bring up, right before your eyes, all the things you have done.
\q
\v 22 Give this careful consideration, you who forget God,
\q otherwise I will tear you to pieces,
\q and there will be no one to come to help you!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **you thought that I was someone just like yourself** - Since God had kept silent and not yet rebuked the wicked people for their actions, they thought that God approved of what they did. AT: "you thought that I was someone who acts just like you do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **reprove** - "rebuke" or "reprimand"
  * **bring up ... all the things you have done** - God speaks of listing all of the evil things that they have done. AT: "list ... all the things you have done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **right before your eyes** - Here, to be "before your eyes" means that it is in a place where they can see. This means that they will not be able to deny the charges that God brings against them. AT: "right in front of you" or "so that you can not deny them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **you who forget God** - God speaks of the wicked rejecting him as if they have forgotten him. He speaks of himself in the third person. AT: "you who reject me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **I will tear you to pieces** - God speaks of destroying the wicked as if he were a lion eating its prey. AT: "I will destroy you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
