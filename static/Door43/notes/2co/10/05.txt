====== 2 Corinthians 10:5-6 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 \add Specifically\add*, I show that the \add human\add* arguments that they use to deceive \add people are completely wrong\add*. When they \add proudly say things that\add* keep other people from knowing God, \add I show them that they are completely wrong. I also enable people to\add* change their ways of thinking so that they think about everything as Christ \add wants them to think\add*.
\v 6 I am also ready to discipline everyone \add among you\add* who has not obeyed \add the things that Christ taught. I will do this\add* as soon as you \add who truly want to obey Christ show me that\add* you are \add going to\add* obey him completely.

<usfm>
\v 5 In this way we can tear apart every false argument and all those who rise up against God. Those are the ones who try to keep people from knowing him. We keep and hold every thought that people have and we take those thoughts as our prisoners. God would work in those who did not obey him, and they will turn to him, and one day they will obey Christ.
\v 6 When you completely obey Christ yourselves, we will be ready to punish any who remain disobedient to him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 We also destroy every high thing that rises up against the knowledge of God. We take every thought captive into obedience to Christ.
\v 6 And we are getting ready to punish every act of disobedience, as soon as your obedience is complete.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **every high thing that rises up** - Paul is still speaking with the metaphor of a war, as if "the knowledge of God" were an army and "every high thing" were a wall that people had made to keep the army out. AT: "every false argument that proud people think of to protect themselves"
  * **every high thing** - "everything that proud people do"
  * **rises up against the knowledge of God** - Paul speaks of arguments as if they were a wall standing high against an army. The words "rises up" mean "stands tall," not that the "high thing" is floating up into the air. AT: "people use so they will not have to know who God is" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **We take every thought captive into obedience to Christ** - Paul speaks of people's thoughts as if they were enemy soldiers whom he captures in battle. AT: "We show how all the false ideas those people have are wrong and teach the people to obey Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **punish every act of disobedience** - The words "act of disobedience" are a metonym for the people who commit those acts. AT: "punish every one of you who disobey us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
