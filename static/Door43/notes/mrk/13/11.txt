\v 11 When people arrest you, do not worry about what you will say. Instead, say what God puts into your mind at that time. Then it will not be just you who will be speaking. It will be the Holy Spirit who will be speaking through you.
\v 12 Some brothers and sisters will betray other brothers and sisters. Some fathers will betray their children. Some children will betray their parents so that government officials will kill their parents.
\v 13 Most people will hate you because you believe in me. But all you who continue to trust in me until your life is finished will be saved.

\v 11 When they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry about what you should say. For in that hour, what you should say will be given to you; it will not be you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.
\v 12 Brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death.
\v 13 You will be hated by everyone because of my name. But whoever endures to the end, that person will be saved.
