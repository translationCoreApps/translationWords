===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Naomi took the child** - This refers to Naomi holding the child. Make sure it does not sound like she took him away from Ruth.
  * **laid him in her bosom** - "held him close against her chest." This is a statement of love and affection for the child.
  * **A son has been born to Naomi** - "The child is like a son to Naomi." It was understood that the child was Naomi's grandson, not her physical son.
  * **father of David** - "father of King David." Though "king" is not stated, it was clear to the original audience that David was King David. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
