\v 19 Then they asked him, "\add If you have a\add* father whom \add we can question about you\add*, where is he?" Jesus replied, "You do not know \add who\add* I \add really am\add*. If you knew who I \add really am\add*, you would know who my Father is also."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verse 20 there is a break in Jesus' speaking where the author give us background information regarding where Jesus had been teaching. Some languages may require the information about the setting to be placed at the beginning of this part of the story in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:08:12|8:12]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

  * **You know neither me nor my Father; if you had known me, you would have known my Father also** - Jesus indicates that to know him is to also know the Father. Both Father and Son are God. "Father" is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **my Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **his hour had not yet come** - The word "hour" is a metonym for the time for Jesus to die. AT: "it was not yet the right time for Jesus to die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
