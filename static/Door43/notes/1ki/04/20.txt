AT: "There were as many people in Judah and Israel as there are grains of sand by the sea" or "there were more people in Judah and Israel than a person could count" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the River** - "the Euphrates River" (UDB)
  * **thirty cors** - A cor is a unit of dry measure. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bvolume]])
  * **deer, gazelles, roebucks** - four-legged animals that run fast (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
