===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he will be high and lifted up, and he will be exalted** - This can be stated in active form. These two phrases "high and lifted up" and "will be exalted" have basically the same meaning and emphasize that Yahweh will honor his servant. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:33:10|33:10]]. AT: "I will give my servant the greatest honor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **horrified at you** - Here "you" refers to Yahweh's servant. However, translators may decide to change "you" to "him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man** - It is implied that the servant is disfigured because enemies beat him very badly. The full meaning of this can be made clear. AT: "his enemies beat his body so badly that he did not even look like a human anymore" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
