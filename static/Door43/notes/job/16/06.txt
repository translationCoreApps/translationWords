\q
\v 6 If I speak, my grief is not lessened;
\q if I keep from speaking, how am I helped?
\q
\v 7 But now, God, you have made me weary;
\q you have made all my family desolate.
\q
\v 8 You have made me dry up, which itself is a witness against me;
\q the leanness of my body rises up against me,
\q and it testifies against my face.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **grief** - Job has experienced great loss of family and health that is unexplained and therefore causes him "great sorrow and emotional pain".
  * **how am I helped?** - Job uses this rhetorical question to express that keeping quiet does not lessen his grief. This question can be written as a statement. AT: "it does not help me at all." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **But now, God, you** - Job now turns his complaining to God.
  * **made all my family desolate** - "destroyed all my family" (UDB)
  * **You have made me dry up** - This means that Job's body has shriveled and become wrinkled. AT: "You  have made my body shrivel up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **which itself is a witness against me** - Job describes the shriveling of his body as if it were an accuser against him. AT: "and people think that shows me to be a sinner" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **the leanness of my body rises up against me, and it testifies against** - Job describes the thinness of his body as if it were accuser against him. AT: "They see how thin my body is, and they think that proves that I am guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **against my face** - Here Job is referred to by his "face." AT: "against me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
