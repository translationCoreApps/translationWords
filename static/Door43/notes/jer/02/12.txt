\q1
\v 13 You, my people, have done two evil things:
\q1 you have rejected me, the one who is like a fountain where you can obtain fresh water,

\v 12 Shudder, heavens, because of this! Be shocked and horrifiedâ€”this is Yahweh's declaration.

  * **Shudder, heavens, because of this! Be shocked and horrified** - Yahweh turns and talks to the heavens as if they were there listening to him. God says this to express that what Israel has done is terrible. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])

  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].

  * **have abandoned the springs of living waters** - God speaks of himself as if he were springs of living waters. AT: "have abandoned me, their springs of living waters" or "have abandoned me, who is like springs of living water" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
