===== translationNotes: =====

  * **walks in his integrity** - Here walking refers to living. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:19:01|19:1]]. AT: "lives by his integrity" or "lives an honest life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **his sons who follow after him** - This simply means that they "follow after him" since they are younger than he and his children. If this phrase is awkward in your language it may be left to be implied. AT: "his sons after him" or "his sons" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **is winnowing with his eyes all the evil that is before him** - This speaks of the king judging between various types of evil as if he were separating them as a person winnows grain. AT: "sees and sorts the different kinds of evils that are brought before him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
