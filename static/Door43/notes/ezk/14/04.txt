Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **who takes his idols into his heart** - Yahweh speaks of the people committing themselves to worshiping idols as if they had taken their idols into their hearts.

  * **who puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face** - Yahweh speaks of the idols that people worship as if they were blocks over which the people stumble, and of being determined to worship those idols as if they had placed those stumbling blocks in front of their faces.
