\v 11 He replied to them, "Would anyone among you who has \add only\add* one sheep that falls into a hole on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f* \add just leave it there\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \add Certainly not!\add* You would take hold of it and lift it out right away, \add and that would be acceptable work on our day of rest, too\add*!
\v 12 \add Because\add* sheep are valuable, \add their owners may work on our day of rest in order to rescue them. So, because\add* people are more valuable than sheep, it is certainly right for us to do something good\add by healing another person any day, including\add* our day of rest!"

\v 11 He replied to them, "Suppose that one of you had just one sheep, and that it fell into a deep hole on the Sabbath day. Would you just leave it there? Certainly not! You would take hold of it and lift it out right away, and that would be alright on our day of rest, too!
\v 12 But a person is much more valuable than a sheep. So it is certainly right for us to do good by healing another person any day, even on our day of rest!"

\v 11 Jesus said to them, "What man would there be among you, who, if he had just one sheep, and if this sheep fell into a deep hole on the Sabbath, would not grasp hold of it and lift it out?
\v 12 How much more valuable, then, is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus responds to the Pharisees' criticism.

  * **What man would there be among you, who, if he had just one sheep ... would not grasp hold of it and lift it out?** - Jesus uses a question to respond to the Pharisees. He is challenging them to think about what kind of work they do on the Sabbath. AT: "Every one of you, if you only had one sheep ... would grab the sheep and lift it out" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **How much more of value, then, is a man than a sheep!** - The phrase "how much more" adds emphasis to the statement. AT: "Obviously, a man is much more valuable than a sheep!" or "Just think about how much more important a man is than a sheep"
  * **it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath** - "those who do good on the Sabbath are obeying the law"
