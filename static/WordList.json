Sometimes this is referred to as a \"dead body\" or a \"corpse.\"\n* When Jesus said to the disciples at his last Passover meal, \"This (bread) is my body,\" he was referring to his physical body that would be \"broken\" (killed) to pay for their sins.\n* In the Bible, Christians as a group are referred to as the \"body of Christ.\"\n* Just as a physical body has many parts, the \"body of Christ\" has many individual members.\n* Each individual believer has a special function in the body of Christ to help the whole group work together to serve God and bring him glory.\n* Jesus is also referred to as the \"head\" (leader) of the \"body\" of his believers. Just as a person's head tells his body what to do, so Jesus is the one who guides and directs Christians as members of his \"body.\"\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* The best way to translate this term would be with the word that is most commonly used to refer to a physical body in the project language. Make sure that the word used is not an offensive term.\n* When referring collectively to believers, for some languages it may be more natural and accurate to say, \"spiritual body of Christ.\"\n* When Jesus says, \"This is my body\" it is best to translate this literally, with a note to explain it if needed.\n* Some languages may have a separate word when referring to a dead body, such as \"corpse\" for a person or \"carcass\" for an animal. Make sure the word used to translate this makes sense in the context and is acceptable.\n\n(See also: [head](../other/head.md) **·** [spirit](../kt/spirit.md))\n\n",

Something that is tied or joined together is called a \"bond.\" The term \"bound\" is the past tense of this term.\n\n* To be \"bound\" means to have something tied or wrapped around something else.\n* In a figurative sense, a person can be \"bound\" to a vow, which means he is \"required to fulfill\" what he promised to do.\n* The term \"bonds\" refers to anything that binds, confines, or imprisons someone. It usually refers to physical chains, fetters or ropes that keep a person from being free to move.\n* In Bible times, bonds such as ropes or chains were used to attach prisoners to the wall or floor of a stone prison.\n* The term \"bind\" can also be used to talk about wrapping cloth around a wound to help it heal.\n* A dead person would be \"bound\" with cloth in preparation for burial.\n* The term \"bond\" is used figuratively to refer to something, such as sin, that controls or enslaves someone.\n* A bond can also be a close relationship between people in which they support each other emotionally, spiritually and physically. This applies to the bond of marriage.\n* For example, a husband and wife are \"bound\" or tied to each other. It is a bond that God does not want broken.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* The term \"bind\" could also be translated as \"tie\" or \"tie up\" or \"wrap (around).\"\n* Figuratively, it could be translated as, \"to restrain\" or \"to prevent\" or \"to keep from (something).\"\n* A special use of \"bind\" in Matthew 16 and 18 means \"forbid\" or \"not permit.\"\n* The term \"bonds\" could be translated as \"chains\" or \"ropes\" or \"shackles.\"\n* Figuratively the term \"bond\" could be translated as \"knot\" or \"connection\" or \"close relationship.\"\n* The phrase, \"bond of peace\" means, \"being in harmony, which brings people in closer relationship to each other\" or \"the tying together that peace brings.\"\n* To \"bind up\" could be translated as, \"wrap around\" or \"put a bandage on.\"\n* To \"bind\" oneself with a vow could be translated as, \"promise to fulfill a vow\" or \"commit to fulfill a vow.\"\n* Depending on the context, the term \"bound\" could also be translate as, \"tied\" or \"tied up\" or \"chained\" or \"obligated (to fulfill)\" or \"required to do.\"\n\n(See also: [fulfill](../kt/fulfill.md) **·** [peace](../other/peace.md) **·** [prison](../other/prison.md) **·** [servant](../other/servant.md) **·** [vow](../kt/vow.md))\n\n",

In the Bible this is called \"unleavened bread\" and was used for the Jews' passover meal.\n* Since bread was the main food for many people in biblical times, this term is also used in the Bible to refer to food in general. (See: [Synecdoche](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_synecdoche.md))\n* The term \"bread of the presence\" referred to twelve loaves of bread that were placed on a golden table in the tabernacle or temple building as a sacrifice to God. These loaves represented the twelve tribes of Israel and were only for the priests to eat. This could be translated as \"bread showing that God lived among them.\" \n* The figurative term, \"bread from heaven\" referred to the special white food called \"manna\" that God provided for the Israelites when they were wandering through the desert.\n* Jesus also called himself the \"bread that came down from heaven\" and the \"bread of life.\"\n* When Jesus and his disciples were eating the Passover meal together before his death, he compared the unleavened Passover bread to his body which would be wounded and killed on a cross.\n* Many times the term \"bread\" can be translated more generally as \"food.\"\n\n(See also: [passover](../kt/passover.md) **·** [tabernacle](../kt/tabernacle.md) **·** [temple](../kt/temple.md) **·** [unleavenedbread](../kt/unleavenedbread.md) **·** [yeast](../other/yeast.md)) \n\n## ",

It was at that point that Adam became a living soul.\n* When Jesus breathed on the disciples and told them to \"receive the Spirit,\" he was probably literally breathing out air onto them to symbolize the Holy Spirit coming to them.\n* Sometimes the terms \"breathing\" and \"breathing out\" are used to refer to speaking.\n* The figurative expression \"breath of God\" or \"breath of Yahweh\" often refers to God's wrath being poured out on rebellious or godless nations. It communicates his power.\n\n## Translation Suggestions ##\n\n* The expression \"breathed his last\" is a figurative way of saying \"he died.\" It could also be translated as, \"he took his last breath\" or \"he stopped breathing and died\" or \"he breathed in air one last time.\"\n* Describing the Scriptures as \"God-breathed\" means that God spoke or inspired the words of the Scriptures which human authors then wrote down. It is probably best, if possible, to translate \"God-breathed\" somewhat literally since it is difficult to communicate the exact meaning of this.\n* If a literal translation of \"God-breathed\" is not acceptable, other ways to translate this could include, \"inspired by God\" or \"authored by God\" or \"spoken by God.\" It could also be said that \"God breathed out the words of Scripture.\"\n* The expressions \"put breath in\" or \"breathe life into\" or \"gives breath to\" could be translated as, \"cause to breathe\" or \"make alive again\" or \"enable them to live and breathe\" or \"give life to.\"\n* If possible, it is best to translate \"breath of God\" with the literal word that is used for \"breath\" in the language. If God cannot be said to have \"breath,\" this could be translated as, \"God's power\" or \"God's speech.\"\n* The expression \"catch my breath\" or \"get my breath\" could be translated as, \"relax in order to breathe more slowly\" or \"stop running in order to breathe normally.\"\n* The expression \"is only a breath\" means \"lasts a very short time.\"\n* Similarly the expression \"man is a single breath\" means \"people live a very short time\" or \"the lives of human beings are very short, like a single breath\" or \"compared to God, the life of a person seems as short as the time it takes to breathe in one breath of air.\"\n\n(See also: [adam](../other/adam.md) **·** [paul](../other/paul.md) **·** [wordofgod](../kt/wordofgod.md) **·** [life](../kt/life.md))\n\n",

God says that he has called his people by his name.\n* A different expression, \"I have called you by name\" means that God knows a person's name personally and has specifically chosen him.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* The term \"call\" could be translated by a word that means \"summon,\" which includes the idea of being intentional or purposeful in calling.\n* The expression \"call out to you\" could be translated as \"ask you for help\" or \"pray to you urgently.\"\n* When the Bible says that God has \"called\" us to be his servants, this could be translated as, \"specially chose us\" or \"appointed us\" to be his servants.\n* \"You must call his name\" can also be translated as, \"you must name him.\"\n* \"His name is called\" could also be translated as, \"his name is\" or \"he is named.\"\n* To \"call out\" could be translated as, \"say loudly\" or \"shout\" or \"say with a loud voice.\" Make sure the translation of this does not sound like the person is angry.\n* The expression \"your calling\" could be translated as \"your purpose\" or \"God's purpose for you\" or \"God's special work for you.\"\n* To \"call on the name of the Lord\" could be translated as \"seek the Lord and depend on him\" or \"trust in the Lord and obey him.\"\n* To \"call for\" something could be translated by \"demand\" or \"ask for\" or \"command.\"\n* The expression \"you are called by my name\" could be translated as, \"I have given you my name, showing that you belong to me.\"\n* When God says,  \"I have called you by name,\" this could be translated as, \"I know your name and have chosen you.\"\n\n(See also: [pray](../other/pray.md))\n\n",

It can also refer figuratively to those who have not been circumcised spiritually, who do not have a relationship with God.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* If the culture of the target language performs circumcisions on males, the word used to refer to this should be used for this term.\n* Other ways to translate this term would be, \"cut around\" or \"cut in a circle\" or \"cut off the foreskin.\"\n* In cultures where circumcision is not known, it may be necessary to explain it in a footnote or glossary.\n* Make sure the term used to translate this does not refer to females. It may be necessary to translate this with a word or phrase that includes the meaning of \"male.\"\n\n(See also: [How to Translate Unknowns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_unknown.md))\n\n(See also: [uncircumcised](../kt/uncircumcised.md) **·** [covenant](../kt/covenant.md))\n\n",

Spiritually, it refers to sinners being separated from a holy God because of their sin.\n\n#### 1. Physical death ####\n\n* To \"die\" means to stop living. Death is the end of physical life.\n* A person's spirit leaves his body when he dies.\n* When Adam and Eve sinned, physical death came into the world.\n* The expression \"put to death\" refers to killing or murdering someone, especially when a king or other ruler gives an order for someone to be killed.\n\n#### 2. Spiritual death ####\n\n* Spiritual death is the separation of a person from God.\n* Adam died spiritually when he disobeyed God. His relationship with God was broken. He became ashamed and tried to hide from God.\n* Every descendant of Adam is a sinner, and is spiritually dead. God makes us spiritually alive again when we have faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* To translate this term, it is best to use the everyday, natural word or expression that refers to death in the target language.\n* In some languages, \"to die\" may be expressed as \"to not live.\" The term \"dead\" may be translated as \"not alive\" or \"not having any life\" or \"not living.\"\n* Many languages use figurative expressions to describe death, such as \"to pass away\" in English. However in the Bible it is best to use the most direct term for death that is used in everyday language.\n* In the Bible, physical life and death are often compared to spiritual life and death. It is important in a translation to use the same word or phrase for both physical death and spiritual death.\n* In some languages it may be more clear to say \"spiritual death\" when the context requires that meaning. Some translators may also feel it is best to say \"physical death\" in contexts where it is being contrasted to spiritual death.\n* The expression, \"the dead\" is a nominal adjective that refers to people who have died. Some languages will translate this as, \"dead people\" or \"people who have died.\"  (See: [nominal adjective](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_nominaladj.md))\n* The expression, \"put to death\" could also be translated as, \"kill\" or \"murder\" or \"execute.\"\n\n(See also: [believe](../kt/believe.md) **·** [faith](../kt/faith.md) **·** [life](../kt/life.md) **·** [spirit](../kt/spirit.md))\n\n",

Older English Bible versions call this \"fornication.\"\n\n* This term can refer to any kind of sexual activity that is against God's will, including homosexual acts and pornography.\n* One type of sexual immorality is adultery, which is sexual activity specifically between a married person and someone who is not that person's spouse.\n* Another type of sexual immorality is \"prostitution,\" which involves being paid to have sex with someone.\n* This term is also used figuratively to refer to Israel's unfaithfulness to God when they worshiped false gods.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* The term \"sexual immorality\" could be translated as \"immorality\" as long as the correct meaning of the term is understood.\n* Other ways to translate this term could include, \"wrong sexual acts\" or \"sex outside of marriage.\"\n* This term should be translated in a different way from the term \"adultery.\"\n* The translation of this term's figurative uses should retain the literal term if possible since there is a common comparison in the Bible between unfaithfulness to God and unfaithfulness in the sexual relationship.\n\n(See also: [adultery, adulterer](../kt/adultery.md) **·** [false god, god](../kt/falsegod.md) **·** [prostitute, harlot](../other/prostitute.md) **·** [unfaithful](../kt/unfaithful.md))\n\n",

These terms are also used figuratively in the Bible.\n\n* The Bible often uses \"fruit\" to refer to a person's actions and thoughts. Just as fruit on a tree shows what kind of tree it is, in the same way a person's words and actions reveal what his character is like.\n* A person can produce good or bad spiritual fruit, but the term \"fruitful\" always has the positive meaning of producing much good fruit.\n* The term \"fruitful\" is also used figuratively to mean \"prosperous.\" This often refers to having many children and descendants, as well as having plenty of food and other wealth.\n* In general, the expression \"fruit of\" refers to anything that comes from or that is produced by something else. For example, the \"fruit of wisdom\" refers to the good things that come from being wise.\n* The expression \"fruit of the land\" refers generally to everything that the land produces for people to eat. This includes not only fruits such as grapes or dates, but also vegetables, nuts, and grains.\n* The figurative expression \"fruit of the Spirit\" refers to godly qualities that the Holy Spirit produces in the lives of people who obey him.\n* The expression, \"fruit of the womb\" refers to \"what the womb produces,\" that is, children.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* It is best to translate this term using the general word for \"fruit\" that is commonly used in the project language to refer to the edible fruit of a fruit tree. In many languages it may be more natural to use the plural\n* , \"fruits\" whenever it refers to more than one fruit.\n* Depending on the context, the term \"fruitful\" could be translated as \"producing much spiritual fruit\" or \"having many children\" or \"prosperous.\"\n* The expression, \"fruit of the land\" could also be translated as, \"food that the land produces\" or \"food crops that are growing in that region.\"\n* When God created animals and people, he commanded them to \"be fruitful and multiply,\" which refers to having many offspring. This could also be translated as, \"have many offspring\" or \"have many children and descendants\" or \"have many children so that you will have many descendants.\"\n* The expression, \"fruit of the womb\" could be translated as \"what the womb produces\" or \"children a women gives birth to\" or just \"children.\" When Elisabeth says to Mary, \"blessed is the fruit of your womb\" she means, \"blessed is the child you will give birth to.\" The project language may also have a different expression for this.\n* Another expression, \"fruit of the vine\" could be translated as \"vine fruit\" or \"grapes.\"\n* Depending on the context, the expression \"will be more fruitful\" could also be translated as, \"will produce more fruit\" or \"will have more children\" or \"will be prosperous.\"\n* The apostle Paul's expression, \"fruitful labor\" could be translated as, \"work that brings very good results\" or \"efforts that result in many people believing in Jesus.\"\n* The \"fruit of the Spirit\" could also be translated as \"works that the Holy Spirit produces\" or \"words and actions that show that the Holy Spirit is working in you.\"\n\n(See also: [descendant](../other/descendant.md) **·** [grain](../other/grain.md) **·** [grape](../other/grape.md) **·** [Holy Spirit, Spirit of God, Spirit of the Lord](../kt/holyspirit.md) **·** [vine](../other/vine.md) **·** [womb](../other/womb.md))\n\n",

Although these projections were called \"horns,\" they were not actually animal horns.\n* The term \"horn\" was sometimes used to refer to a \"flask\" that was shaped like a horn and was used for holding water or oil.

Spiritual life ####\n\n* A person has spiritual life when he believes in Jesus and God gives that person a transformed life with the Holy Spirit living in him.\n* This life is also called \"eternal life\" to indicate that it does not end.\n* The opposite of spiritual life is spiritual death, which means being separated from God and experiencing eternal punishment.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* Depending on the context, \"life\" can be translated as \"existence\" or \"person\" or \"soul\" or \"being\" or \"experience.\"\n* The term \"live\" could be translated by \"dwell\" or \"reside\" or \"exist.\"\n* The expression \"end of his life\" could be translated as, \"when he stopped living.\"\n* The expression \"spared their lives' could be translated as, \"allowed them to live\" or \"did not kill them.\"\n* The expression \"they risked their lives\" could be translated as, \"they put themselves in danger\" or \"they did something that could have killed them.\" \n* When the Bible text talks about being alive spiritually, \"life\" could be translated as \"spiritual life\" or \"eternal life,\" depending on the context.\n* The concept of \"spiritual life\" could also be translated as, \"God making us alive in our spirits\" or \"new life by God's Spirit\" or \"being made alive in our inner self.\"\n* Depending on the context, the expression \"give life\" could also be translated as, \"cause to live\" or \"give eternal life\" or \"cause to live eternally.\"\n\n(See also: [death](../kt/death.md) **·** [eternity](../kt/eternity.md))\n\n",

(See: [Metaphor](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_metaphor.md))\n\n* Jesus said, \"I am the light of the world\" to express that he brings God's true message to the world and rescues people from the darkness of their sin.\n* Christians are commanded to \"walk in the light,\" which means they should be living the way God wants them to and avoiding evil.\n* The apostle John stated that \"God is light,\" and there is no darkness in him.\n* Light and darkness are completely opposite. Darkness is the absence of all light. \n* Jesus said that he is \"the light of the world\" and that his followers should shine like lights in the world, by living in a way that clearly shows how great God is.\n* \"Walking in the light\" represents living in a way that pleases God, doing what is good and right. Walking in darkness represents living in rebellion against God, doing evil things.\n \n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* When translating, it is important to keep the literal terms \"light\" and \"darkness\" even when they are used figuratively.\n* It may be necessary to explain the comparison in the text. For example, \"walk as children of light\" could be translated as, \"live openly righteous lives, like someone who walks in bright sunlight.\"\n* Make sure that the translation of \"light\" does not refer to an object that gives light, such as a lamp. The translation of this term should refer to the light itself.\n\n(See also: [darkness](../kt/darkness.md) **·** [holy](../kt/holy.md) **·** [righteous](../kt/righteous.md) **·** [true](../kt/true.md))\n\n",

      "file": "# love, loves, loving #\n\n## Definition: ##\n\nTo love another person is to care for that person and do things that will benefit him. There are different meanings for \"love\" which some languages may express using different words:\n\n1. The kind of love that comes from God is focused on the good of others, even when it doesn't benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do. God himself is love and is the source of true love.\n\n* Jesus showed this kind of love by sacrificing his life in order to rescue us from sin and death. He also taught his followers to love others sacrificially.\n* When people love others with this kind of love, it involves actions that show that someone is thinking of what will cause the other person to thrive. This kind of love especially includes forgiving others.\n* In the ULB, the word \"love\" refers to this kind of sacrificial love, unless a Translation Note indicates a different meaning.\n\n2. Another word in the New Testament refers to brotherly love or love for a friend or family member.\n\n* This term refers to natural human love between friends or relatives.\n* It can also be used in such contexts as, \"They love to sit in the most important seats at a banquet.\" This means that they \"like very much\" or \"greatly desire\" to do that.\n\n3. The word \"love\" can also refer to romantic love between a man and a woman.\n\n4. In the figurative expression, \"Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated,\" the term \"loved\" refers to God's choosing of Jacob to be in a covenant relationship with him. This could also be translated as \"chosen.\" Although Esau was also blessed by God, he wasn't given the privilege of being in the covenant. The term \"hated\" is used figuratively here to mean \"rejected\" or \"not chosen.\"\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* Unless indicated otherwise in a Translation Note, the word \"love\" in the ULB refers to the kind of sacrificial love that comes from God.\n* Some languages may have a special word for the kind of unselfish, sacrificial love that God has. Ways to translate this might include, \"devoted, faithful caring\" or \"care for unselfishly\" or \"love from God.\" Make sure that the word used to translate God's love can include giving up one's own interests to benefit others and loving others no matter what they do.\n* Sometimes the English word \"love\" describes the deep caring that people have for friends and family members. Some languages might translate this with a word or phrase that means, \"like very much\" or \"care for\" or \"have strong affection for.\"\n* In contexts where the word \"love\" is used to express a strong preference for something, this could be translated by \"strongly prefer\" or \"like very much\" or \"greatly desire.\"\n* Some languages may also have a separate word that refers to romantic or sexual love between a husband and wife.\n* Many languages must express \"love\" as an action. So for example, they might translate \"love is patient, love is kind\" as, \"when a person loves someone, he is patient with him and kind to him.\"\n\n(See also: [covenant](../kt/covenant.md) **·** [death](../kt/death.md) **·** [sacrifice](../other/sacrifice.md) **·** [save](../kt/save.md) **·** [sin](../kt/sin.md))\n\n",

These were all miracles.\n* God also enabled the prophets and the apostles to perform miracles of healing and other things that were only possible through God's power.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* Possible translations of \"miracles\" or \"wonders\" could include, \"impossible things that God does\" or \"powerful works of God\" or \"amazing acts of God.\"\n* The frequent expression \"signs and wonders\" could be translated as \"proofs and miracles\" or \"miraculous works that prove God's power\" or \"amazing miracles that show how great God is.\"\n* Note that this meaning of a miraculous sign is different from a sign that gives proof or evidence for something. The two can be related.\n\n(See also: [power](../kt/power.md) **·** [prophet](../kt/prophet.md) **·** [apostle](../kt/apostle.md) **·** [sign](../kt/sign.md))\n\n",

A \"redeemer\" is someone who redeems something or someone.\n\n* God gave laws to the Israelites about how to redeem people or things.\n* For example, someone could redeem a person who was in slavery by paying the price so that the slave could go free. The word \"ransom\" also refers to this practice.\n* If someone's land had been sold, a relative of that person could \"redeem\" or \"buy back\" that land so that it would stay in the family.\n* These practices show how God redeems people who are in slavery to sin. When he died on the cross, Jesus paid the full payment for people's sins and redeemed all those who trust in him for salvation. People who have been redeemed by God are set free from sin and its punishment.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* Depending on the context, the term \"redeem\" could also be translated as \"buy back\" or \"pay to free (someone)\" or \"ransom.\"\n* The term \"redemption\" could be translated as \"ransom\" or \"freedom payment\" or \"the buying back.\"\n* The words, \"ransom\" and \"redeem\" have basically the same meaning, so some languages may only use one term to translate both these terms.\n\n(See also: [free](../kt/free.md) **·** [ransom](../kt/ransom.md))\n\n",

This should be translated using the term that the language uses to refer to this hand. \n* Regarding figurative uses, if an expression that includes the term \"right hand\" does not have the same meaning in the project language, then consider whether that language has a different expression with the same meaning.\n* The expression \"at the right hand of\" could be translated as \"on the right side of\" or \"in the place of honor beside\" or \"in the position of strength\" or \"ready to help.\"\n* Ways to translate \"with his right hand\" could include, \"with authority\" or \"using power\" or \"with his amazing strength.\"\n* The figurative expression \"his right hand and his mighty arm\" uses two ways of emphasizing God's power and great strength.

The surrounding text usually makes it clear whether a servant or a slave is being referred to.\n\n* In Bible times, there was less of a difference between a servant and a slave than there is today. Both servants and slaves were an important part of their master's household and many were treated almost like members of the family. Sometimes a servant would choose to become a lifetime servant to his master.\n* A slave is a kind of servant who is the property of the person he works for. The person who buys a slave is called his \"owner\" or \"master.\" Some masters treat their slaves very cruelly, while other masters treat their slaves very well, like a servant who is a valued member of the household.\n* In ancient times, some people willingly became slaves to a person they owed money to in order to pay off their debt to that person. \n* In the Bible, the phrase \"I am your servant\" was used as a sign of respect and service to a person of higher rank, such as a king. It does not mean that the person speaking was an actual servant.\n* In the Old Testament, God's prophets and other people who worshiped God are often referred to as his \"servants.\"\n* In the New Testament, people who obey God through faith in Christ are often called his \"servants.\"\n* Christians are also called \"slaves to righteousness,\" which is a metaphor that compares the commitment to obey God to a slave's commitment to obeying his master.

The verb \"to shepherd\" means to protect the sheep and provide them with food and water.\n\n* Shepherds watch over the sheep, leading them to places with good food and water. Shepherds also keep the sheep from getting lost and protect them from wild animals.\n* This term is often used metaphorically in the Bible to refer to taking care of people's spiritual needs. This includes teaching them what God has told them in the Bible and guiding them in the way they should live. (See: [Metaphor](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_metaphor.md))\n* In the Old Testament, God is called the \"shepherd\" of his people because he takes care of all their needs and protects them. He also leads and guides them.\n* Moses was a shepherd for the Israelites as he guided them spiritually in their worship of Yahweh and led them physically on their journey to the land of Canaan.\n* In the New Testament, Jesus calls himself the \"good shepherd.\" The apostle Paul also refers to him as the \"great shepherd\" over the Church.\n* Also in the New Testament, the term \"shepherd\" is used to refer to a person who is a spiritual leader over other believers. The term \"pastor\" is the same word as \"shepherd.\" The elders and overseers were also called shepherds.\n\n## Translation Suggestions ##\n\n* When used literally, the action \"shepherd\" could be translated as \"take care of sheep\" or \"watch over sheep.\"\n* The person \"shepherd\" could be translated as, \"person who takes care of sheep\" or \"sheep tender\" or \"sheep caregiver.\"\n* When used as a metaphor, different ways to translate this term could include, \"spiritual shepherd\" or \"spiritual leader\" or \"one who is like a shepherd\" or \"one who cares for his people like a shepherd cares for his sheep\" or \"one who leads his people like a shepherd guides his sheep\" or \"one who takes care of God's sheep.\"\n* In some contexts, \"shepherd\" could be translated as \"leader\" or \"guide\" or \"caregiver.\"\n* The expression, \"to shepherd (a flock)\" could be translated as, \"to take care of\" or \"to spiritually nourish\" or \"to guide and teach\" or \"to lead and take care of (like a shepherd cares for sheep)\"\n* In figurative uses, it is best to use or include the literal word for \"shepherd\" in the translation of this term.\n\n(See also: [believer](../kt/believer.md) **·** [canaan](../other/canaan.md) **·** [church](../kt/church.md) **·** [moses](../other/moses.md) **·** [pastor](../kt/pastor.md) **·** [sheep](../other/sheep.md) **·** [spirit](../kt/spirit.md))\n\n## ",

For example, the statement that our \"sins will be as white as snow\" means that God completely cleanses his people from their sins.\n* Some languages might refer to snow as \"frozen rain\" or \"flakes of ice\" or \"frozen flakes.\"\n* \"Snow water\" refers to the water that comes from melted snow.\n\n(See also: [How to Translate Unknowns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_unknown.md))\n\n(Translation suggestions: [Translate Names](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_names.md))\n\n(See also: [lebanon](../other/lebanon.md) **·** [purify](../kt/purify.md))\n\n## ",

It can refer either to someone's male offspring or to an adopted son.\n\n* \"Son\" is often used figuratively in the Bible to refer to any male descendant, such as a grandson or great-grandson.\n* The term \"son\" can also be used as a polite form of address to a boy or man who is younger.\n* Sometimes \"sons of God\" is used in the New Testament to refer to believers in Christ.\n* God calls Israel his \"firstborn son.\" This refers to God's choosing of the nation of Israel to be his special people. It is through them that God's message of redemption and salvation came, with the result that many other people have become his spiritual children.\n* The phrase \"son of\" often has the figurative meaning, \"having the characteristics of.\" Examples of this include, \"sons of the light,\" \"sons of disobedience,\" \"a son of peace,\" and \"sons of thunder.\"\n* The phrase \"son of\" is also used to tell who a person's father is. This phrase is used in genealogies and many other places.\n* Using \"son of\" to give the name of the father frequently helps distinguish people who have the same name. For example, \"Azariah, son of Zadok\" and  \"Azariah, son of Nathan\" in 1 Kings 4, and \"Azariah, son of Amaziah in 2 Kings 15 are three different men.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* In most occurrences of this term, it is best to translate \"son\" using the literal term in the language that is used to refer to a son.\n* When translating the term \"Son of God,\" the project language's common term for \"son\" should be used.\n* When used to refer to a descendant rather than a direct son, the term \"descendant\" could be used, as in referring to Jesus as the \"descendant of David\" or in genealogies where sometimes \"son\" refers to a male descendant, not an actual son.\n* Sometimes \"sons\" can be translated as \"children,\" when both males and females are being referred to. For example, \"sons of God\" could be translated as \"children of God\" since this expression also includes girls and women.\n* The figurative expression \"son of\" could also be translated as \"someone who has the characteristics of\" or \"someone who is like\" or \"someone who has\" or \"someone who acts like.\"\n\n(See also: [azariah](../other/azariah.md) **·** [descendant](../other/descendant.md) **·** [father](../other/father.md) **·** [firstborn](../kt/firstborn.md) **·** [sonofgod](../kt/sonofgod.md) **·** [sonsofgod](../kt/sonsofgod.md))\n\n",

A \"broken cistern\" happened when the plaster became cracked so that the water leaked out.\n* Cisterns were often located in the courtyard area of people's homes to catch the rainwater that would run off the roof.\n* Wells were often located where they could be accessed by several families or a whole community.\n* Because water was very important for both people and livestock, the right to use a well was often a cause of strife and conflict.\n* Both wells and cisterns were usually covered with a large stone to prevent anything falling in it. Often there was a rope with a bucket or pot attached to it to bring the water up to the surface.\n* Sometimes a dry cistern was used as a place to imprison someone, such as happened to Joseph and Jeremiah.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* Ways to translate \"well\" could include, \"deep water hole\" or \"deep hole for spring water\" or \"deep hole for drawing water.\"\n* The term \"cistern\" could be translated as \"stone water pit\" or \"deep and narrow pit for water\" or \"underground tank for holding water.\"\n* These terms are similar in meaning. The main difference is that a well continually receives water from underground springs, whereas a cistern is a holding tank for water that usually comes from rain.\n\n(See also: [jeremiah](../other/jeremiah.md) **·** [prison](../other/prison.md) **·** [strife](../other/strife.md))\n\n## ",

It also means that he is always present.\n* Following tradition, many Bible versions use the term \"LORD\" or \"the LORD\" to represent \"Yahweh.\" This tradition resulted from the fact that historically, the Jewish people became afraid of mispronouncing Yahweh's name and started saying \"Lord\" every time the term \"Yahweh\" appeared in the text. Modern Bibles write \"LORD\" with all capital letters to show respect for God's personal name and to distinguish it from \"Lord\" which is a different Hebrew word.\n* The ULB and UDB texts always translate this term as, \"Yahweh,\" as it literally occurs in the Hebrew text of the Old Testament.\n* The term \"Yahweh\" does not ever occur in the original text of the New Testament; only the Greek term for \"Lord\" is used, even in quotes from the Old Testament.\n\n## Translation Suggestions: ##\n\n* \"Yahweh\" could be translated by a word or phrase that means \"I am\" or \"living one\" or \"the one who is\" or \"he who is alive.\"\n* This term could also be written in a way that is similar to how \"Yahweh\" is spelled.\n* Some church denominations prefer not to use the term \"Yahweh\" and instead use the traditional rendering, \"LORD.\" An important consideration is that this may be confusing when read aloud because it will sound the same as the title \"Lord.\" Some languages may have an affix or other grammatical marker that could be added to distinguish \"LORD\" as a name (Yahweh) from \"Lord\" as a title.\n\n(Translation suggestions: [How to Translate Names](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_names.md))\n\n(See also: [god](../kt/god.md) **·** [lord](../kt/lord.md) **·** [lordgod](../kt/lordgod.md) **·** [moses](../other/moses.md) **·** [reveal](../kt/reveal.md))\n\n",
