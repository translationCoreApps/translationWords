\v 6 Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Pharaoh.

  * **they have been a reed stalk** - Yahweh compares the people of Egypt and Pharaoh with a reed stalk because the people of Israel relied on the Egyptians to help them in war, but the Egyptians were not strong enough to help them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **reed** - a plant that grows near water and looks like very large grass
  * **stalk** - the part of a reed that is long and like a thick stick. People can use them like sticks, but the stalks of reeds are not as strong as wood and can break suddenly.
  * **took hold of you** - The word "you" refers to Pharaoh.
  * **you shattered their legs and made their hips to shake** - "you injured their entire hip" God is speaking here of the harm that the Israelites experienced when they trusted in the Egyptians to defend them against Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
