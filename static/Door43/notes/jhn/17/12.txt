<usfm>
\v 12 While I have been with them, I have \add completely\add* protected them by the power \f + \ft metonymy \f* that you gave me. As a result, only one of them will be eternally separated from you. He is the one who was doomed to be eternally separated from you. \add That has happened\add* to fulfill \add what a prophet wrote\add* in the Scriptures \add would happen\add*.
\p
\v 13 \add Father\add*, now I am about to return to you. I have said these things while I am still \add here\add* in the world in order that my \add disciples\add* may fully experience being joyful, as I have been joyful.
\v 14 I have given them your message. As a result, those who are opposed to you \f + \ft metonymy \f* have hated them, because \add my disciples\add* do not belong to those who oppose you \f + \ft metonymy \f*, just like I do not belong to those who oppose you \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

\v 12 While I was with them, I kept them safe and watched over them by your own power. Not one of them was lost, except the one whom you had destined for destruction, as the scriptures foretold long ago.
\p
\v 13 Now I am coming to you, Father. I have said these things while I am here in the world so that I may give them my complete joy.
\v 14 I have spoken your messages to them, and the world has hated them and would not listen to your message. The world hated them because, like me, they do not belong to this world, but they have another home.

\v 12 While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I protected them, and not one of them was destroyed, except for the son of destruction, so that the scriptures would be fulfilled.
\v 13 Now I am coming to you, but I am saying these things in the world so that they will have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
\v 14 I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
