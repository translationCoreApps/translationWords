\v 20 Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They went to him together. They persuaded Blastus, the king's assistant, to help them. Then they asked for peace, because their country received its food from the king's country.
\v 21 On a set day Herod dressed himself in royal clothing and sat on a throne; he made a speech to them.
