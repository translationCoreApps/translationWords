\v 3 But Tattenai, the governor of the province west of the Euphrates River, and Shethar Bozenai, his assistant, together with some of their officials went to Jerusalem and said to the people, "Who has permitted you to rebuild this temple?"
\v 4 They also asked the Jews to tell them the names of the men who were working on the temple.
\v 5 However, God was taking care of the Jewish leaders and they were not stopped by their enemies. They were waiting for King Darius to make a royal decree that would either give them permission and his protection so they could finish their work on the temple, or stop their work completely.
