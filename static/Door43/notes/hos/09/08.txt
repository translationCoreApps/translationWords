<usfm>
\v 8 My God appointed \add me and the other\add* prophets
\q2 to be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* watchmen \add to warn\add* you people of Israel,
\q1 but everywhere that we go, \add it is as though\add* people set traps for us
\q2 and people are hostile to us, \add even\add* in the temple of our God.
\q1
\v 9 The sins that the Israelite people have committed are as awful as \add what the men of\add* Gibeah did long ago;
\q1 so I will not forget the wicked things that they have done;
\q2 I will punish them for all those sins.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 True prophets are people whom God has assigned to guard the people of Israel.
\q2 But everywhere they go, others set traps for them;
\q2 even in the temple of their God, others hate them.
\q1
\v 9 The people have polluted themselves by sinning
\q2 as the Israelites did at Gibeah long ago.
\q1 God will not forget the wicked things they did;
\q2 he will certainly punish them.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 The prophet is the watchman for my God over Ephraim.
\q But a bird snare is on all of his paths,
\q and hostility toward him is in the house of his God.
\q
\v 9 They have deeply corrupted themselves
\q as in the days of Gibeah.
\q God will call to mind their iniquity,
\q and he will punish their sins.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Hosea the prophet is speaking.

  * **The prophet is the watchman for my God over Ephraim** - A "watchman" watches outside his city to see if danger is coming. The prophet warning the people when they are sinning and are in danger of having his God punish them is spoken of as if he were a watchman for the city. AT: "The prophet is like a watchman for God over Ephraim" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The prophet is the watchman for my God over Ephraim** - Some versions translate this passage as "The prophet with my God is the watchman over Ephraim."
  * **The prophet is** - This refers to prophets in general that God has appointed. AT: "Prophets are" or "True prophets are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **Ephraim** - Here "Ephraim" represents all the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a bird snare is on all of his paths** - A "bird snare" is a trap used to catch a bird. This means the people of Israel do whatever they can to stop God's prophet. AT: "the people set a trap for him wherever he goes" or "the people do all they can to harm him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah** - "The people of Israel have sinned and become very corrupt as they did at Gibeah long ago." This is probably a reference to the shocking actions of the tribe of Benjamin recounted in Judges 19-21.
