<usfm>
\v 8 Last of all he appeared to me, although I am very unlike the other apostles.
\v 9 For I am the least of the apostles. I made the church of Christ suffer greatly, so I do not deserve to be an apostle.

<usfm>
\v 8 Last of all, he appeared to me, as if to a child born at the wrong time.
\v 9 For I am the least of the apostles. I am unworthy to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Last of all** - "Finally, after he had appeared to the others"
  * **a child born at the wrong time** - This is an idiom by which Paul may mean that he became a Christian much later than the other apostles. Or perhaps he means that, unlike the other apostles, he did not witness Jesus' three-year-long ministry. AT: "someone who missed the experiences of the others" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
