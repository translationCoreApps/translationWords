===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Similarly, \add tell\add* the older women that they should behave in a reverent manner that shows that they are devoted to God\f + \ft Or: in a manner that honors God \f*; \add specifically, they should\add* not slander others\f + \ft Or: talk evil about others \f*, and they should not be drinking much\add \f + \ft Or: habitually\add* drinking \f* \add alcohol\add*. Tell them that they should teach \add the younger women\add* what is good,
\v 4 in order that they may love their husbands and love their children.
\v 5 They should teach them to control what they say and do and to be pure in every way, to be good workers at home and submissive to their own husbands. \add The younger women should behave like this\add* in order that no one will speak against the message about God.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 The older women, like the men, should live so that everyone knows that they respect God very much. They must not say bad things about other people, and they must not drink very much wine. But they should teach others what is good.
\v 4 In this way, they should teach the younger women to think wisely and to love their own husbands and children.
\v 5 The older women should also teach the younger women to think good thoughts, not to act in a bad way toward any man, to work well at home, and to do what their husbands tell them. They should do all these things so that no one will mock God's word.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Older women likewise should always present themselves as reverent, not gossips. They should not be enslaved to much wine. They should teach what is good
\v 4 in order to train the younger women to sensibly love their own husbands and children.
\v 5 They should train them to be sensible, pure, good housekeepers, and obedient to their own husbands. They should do these things so that God's word may not be insulted.

  * **gossips** - This word refers to people who say bad things about other people whether they are true or not.
  * **enslaved to much wine** - A person who habitually feels the need to drink alcoholic beverages usually drinks them in great amounts. Paul speaks of addicted persons as if they were slaves. AT: "addicted to wine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
