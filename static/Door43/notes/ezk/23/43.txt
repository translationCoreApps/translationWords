====== Ezekiel 23:43-45 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 43 Then I said about the woman who had become exhausted by her having sex with many men, 'Now allow those men to act toward her as though she is a prostitute, because that is all that she is.'
\v 44 So they had sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with those two women, Oholah and Oholibah, like men have sex with prostitutes.
\v 45 But righteous men will condemn them to be punished, like women who commit adultery and who murder others are punished, because those women commit adultery and they murder \f + \ft metonymy \f* others.

\v 43 Then I said of her who was worn out by adultery, 'Now they will be sexually immoral with her, and she with them.'
\v 44 They went in to her and slept with her as men go in to be with a prostitute. In this way they slept with Oholah and Oholibah, who were immoral women.
\v 45 But righteous men will pass judgment and punish them as adulteresses, and they will punish them with the sentence for those who shed blood, because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands.
