\v 8 Then Aaron must cast lots for the two goats, one lot for Yahweh, and the other lot for the scapegoat.
\v 9 Aaron must then present the goat on which the lot fell for Yahweh, and offer that goat as a sin offering.
\v 10 But the goat on which the lot fell for the scapegoat must be brought alive before Yahweh, to make atonement by sending him away as a scapegoat into the wilderness.
