===== translationNotes: =====

  * **May those who love you have peace ... peace within your fortresses** - This section states the content of the prayer that the writer wants his audience to pray. He asks them to speak directly to the city of Jerusalem, as if the city was a person who could hear them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **May there be peace within ... may they have peace within** - These two phrases have the same meanings and are used together to strengthen each other. AT: "May the people in Jerusalem live in peace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **within the walls that defend you ... within your fortresses** - Here Jerusalem is referred to by the fortress walls that protects it. The terms "walls" and "fortress" refer to the same thing. AT: "within Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
