===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword will devour flesh with the blood** - Yahweh speaks of arrows as if they were people to whom he could give alcohol and make them drunk, and of a sword as if it were a person who was so hungry that he would eat an animal before draining the blood out. These metaphors are metonyms for a soldier using arrows and a sword to kill many enemies. This in turn is a metaphor for Yahweh killing his enemies in war. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **from the heads of the leaders of the enemy** - Another possible meaning is "from the long-haired heads of the enemy."
