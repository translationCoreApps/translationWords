<usfm>
\v 13 The men who did the repair work worked hard, and the work of repairing the temple progressed. They rebuilt the temple to cause it to be like it was originally, and they made it stronger.
\v 14 When they had finished the repair work, they brought to the king and to Jehoiada the money that they had not used for the repairs. That money was used to make things to use for offering the sacrifices that were completely burned \add on the altar\add*, and to make bowls and other gold and silver things for the temple. As long as Joash lived, the people continually brought to the temple sacrifices that were to be completely burned on the altar.

\v 13 So the workmen labored, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands; they set up the house of God in its original design and strengthened it.
\v 14 When they finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada. This money was used to make furnishing for the house of Yahweh, utensils with which to serve and make offeringsâ€”spoons and utensils of gold and silver. They offered burnt offerings in the house of Yahweh continually for all the days of Jehoiada.
