<usfm>
\v 8 People are repeatedly telling you, 'The temple is here, so we are safe,' and you are trusting that what they are saying is true. But those people are deceiving you; what they say is worthless.
\v 9 You think that you can steal things, murder people, commit adultery, tell lies in court, and worship Baal and all those other gods that you did not know about previously.
\v 10 Then you think you can come here and stand in front of this temple, which is my temple, and say 'Nothing bad will happen to us!', while you continue to do all those disgusting things.
\v 11 Perhaps you do not know that you have made this temple, which is my temple, to become like a cave where thieves hide. But I, Yahweh, am telling you that I have seen all these things!

<usfm>
\p
\v 8 Behold! You are trusting in deceitful words that do not help you.
\v 9 Do you steal, kill, and commit adultery? Do you swear deceitfully and offer incense to Baal and walk after other gods whom you have not known?
\v 10 Then do you come and stand before me in this house that is called by my name and say, "We are saved," so you can do all of these abominations?
\v 11 Is this house, which carries my name, a den of bandits in your eyes? But behold, I have seen itâ€”this is Yahweh's declaration.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues giving Jeremiah his message to the people of Judah.
  * **General Information:** - The word "you" in these verses refers to the people of Judah.

  * **Behold!** - The word "Behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the information that follows. 
  * **Do you steal, kill, and commit adultery? Do you swear ... and walk after other gods whom you have not known?** - These questions expect a positive answer to make the point that God knows the sins they are committing. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "You steal, kill, and commit adultery. You swear ... and walk after other gods whom you have not known." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **swear deceitfully** - "lie even in your oaths"
  * **walk after other gods** - Here walking after is a metonym for following after with the intent to serve and obey. Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:07:05|7:6]]. AT: "serve other gods" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Then do you come and stand ... so you can do all of these abominations?** - This question expects a positive answer to make the point that God knows the hypocrisy of their words and actions. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "Then you come and stand ... so you can do all of these abominations." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this house that is called by my name** - This is a metonym for Yahweh's temple. It can be expressed in active form. AT: "this house that belongs to me" or "this temple where you worship me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Is this house, which carries my name, a den of bandits in your eyes?** - This question expects a positive answer to make the point that God knows what they think about Yahweh's temple. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "This house, which carries my name, is a den of bandits in your eyes!" or "You act as though you think this house, which is called by my name, should be a place where bandits can go to hide!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this house, which carries my name** - Yahweh's temple is spoken of as if it was carrying the name of Yahweh. This has a similar meaning to "this house that is called by my name" in the previous verse. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **bandits** - "robbers." This word refers to violent men who steal and destroy.
  * **But behold, I have seen it** - "But I certainly have seen what you are doing"
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
