\v 16 "When you abstain from eating food \add in order to please God\add*, do not look sad as the hypocrites look. They make their faces appear sad in order that people will see that they are abstaining from food \add and will think highly of them\add*. Keep this in mind: \add People will think highly of those people for that\add*, but\add that is the only\add* reward those people will get!
\v 17 Instead, \add each of\add* you, when you abstain from food, should comb your hair and wash your face \add as usual\add*,
\v 18 in order that other people will not notice that you are fasting\add because you will look as you always do\add*. But \add God\add*, your Father, whom no one can see, \add will observe that you are abstaining from food. God\add* your Father sees \add you\add* even though no one else sees \add you\add*, and he will reward you."

\v 16 Moreover, when you fast, do not have a mournful face as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces so that they may appear to people as fasting. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.
\v 17 But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
\v 18 so that it would not appear to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret, will reward you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins to teach about fasting.
  * **General Information:** - Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. All occurrences of "you" and "your" in verses 17 and 18 are singular, but you may want to translate them as plural to match the plural "you" in verse 16. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **Moreover** - "Also"
  * **they disfigure their faces** - The hypocrites would not wash their faces or comb their hair. They did this purposely to draw attention to themselves so that people would see them and give them honor for fasting.
  * **Truly I say to you** - "I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **anoint your head** - "put oil in your hair" or "groom your hair." To "anoint" the head here is to take normal care of one's hair. It has nothing to do with "Christ" meaning "anointed one." Jesus means that people should look the same whether they are fasting or not.
  * **Father who is in secret** - Possible meanings are 1) no one can see God, or 2) God is in that private place with the person praying. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:06:05|6:6]].
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **who sees in secret** - "who sees what you do in private." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:06:05|6:6]].
