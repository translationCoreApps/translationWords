===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - While Jesus and his disciples are in a boat, they have a discussion about the lack of understanding among the Pharisees and Herod, though they had seen many signs. 

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here the author tells background information about the disciples forgetting to bring bread. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **no more than one loaf** - The negative phrase "no more" is used to emphasize how small an amount of bread they had. AT: "only one loaf" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **Keep watch and be on guard** - These two terms have a common meaning and are repeated here for emphasis. They can be combined. AT: "Keep watch" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod** - Here Jesus is speaking to his disciples in a metaphor they do not understand. Jesus is comparing the Pharisees' and Herod's teachings to yeast, but you should not explain this when you translate it because the disciples themselves did not understand it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
