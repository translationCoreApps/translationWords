===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Ascribe strength to God** - "Ascribe" means to give credit to someone. AT: "Strength belongs to God"
  * **his strength is in the skies** - The abstract noun "strength" can be stated as an action. AT: "in the skies he also shows that he is powerful" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **God, you are fearsome in your holy place** - Here the author speaks directly to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **strength and power** - These two words mean basically these same thing. They emphasize how much strength God provides to his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
