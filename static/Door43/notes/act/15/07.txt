\v 7 After they had discussed it for a long time, Peter stood up and spoke to them. He said, "Fellow believers, you \add all\add* know that a long time ago God chose me from among you \add other apostles, in order that\add* the non-Jewish people might \add also\add* hear me \f + \ft synecdoche \f* tell \add them\add* the good message \add about the Lord Jesus\add*, so that they could hear \add it\add* and believe \add in him. So Paul and Barnabas are not the first ones to tell non-Jews about Jesus\add*.
\v 8 God knows \add and judges\add* people according to what they think, \add not according to who their ancestors were\add*. By sending the Holy Spirit to \add the non-Jews\add*, just like \add he had\add* also done for us\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* Jews, he showed \add me and others\add* that he had accepted them \add to be his people\add*.
\v 9 \add God\add* saved us \add Jews\add* and those \add non-Jews\add* similarly, making them clean inside simply as a result of their believing \add in the Lord Jesus. That was exactly how he has forgiven us\add*.

\v 7 After they had discussed it for a long time, Peter stood up and spoke to them. He said, "Fellow believers, you all know that a long time ago God chose me from among you other apostles, in order that I might tell the non-Jewish people also about God's love, and in order that they might believe in him.
\v 8 God knows the hearts of all people. He showed me and others that he had accepted the non-Jews to be his people by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just like he had also done for us.
\v 9 God made no distinction between us and them, because he made them clean inside simply as a result of their believing in the Lord Jesus. That is exactly how he has forgiven us.

\v 7 After much debate, Peter stood up and said to them,
\p "Brothers, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
\v 8 God, who knows the heart, witnesses to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us;
\v 9 and he made no distinction between us and them, making their hearts clean by faith.
