\v 20 One day Jesus was asked by some Pharisees "When will God begin to rule everyone?" He replied, "That is not about signs that people can see with their own eyes.
\v 21 People will not be able to say, 'Look! He is ruling here!' Or 'He is ruling there!' because, contrary to what you think, God has already begun to rule within you."
