===== translationNotes: =====

  * **When the angel who spoke to him had left** - "When Cornelius' vision of the angel had ended"
  * **a soldier who worshiped God from among the soldiers who were also serving him** - "one of the soldiers who served him, who also worshiped God." This soldier worshiped God. That was rare in the Roman army, so Cornelius' other soldiers probably did not worship God.
  * **told them all that had happened** - Cornelius explained his vision to his two servants and to one of his soldiers.
  * **sent them to Joppa** - "sent two of his two servants and the one soldier to Joppa"
