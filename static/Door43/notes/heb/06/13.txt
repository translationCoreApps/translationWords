<usfm>
\v 13 When God promised to \add do things for\add* Abraham, he said that he would punish himself \add if he did not do that\add*, because there was no one of greater importance to ask to punish him \add if he did not do it\add*.
\v 14 He said \add to Abraham\add*, "I will certainly bless you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add*, and I will certainly increase \add the number of\add* your \add descendants\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f*."
\v 15 As a result, after Abraham patiently waited \add for God to do what he promised\add*, he obtained what \add God\add* promised him.

\v 13 When God promised to do great things for Abraham, there was no one greater than himself whom he could ask to force himself to do those things. So he asked himself.
\v 14 Then he said to Abraham, "I will certainly bless you and I will certainly greatly increase the number of your descendants."
\v 15 So after Abraham patiently waited for God to do what he promised, God did for him what he had promised.

\v 13 For when God made his promise to Abraham, he swore by himself, since he could not swear by anyone greater.
\v 14 He said, "I will certainly bless you, and I will greatly increase you."
\v 15 In this way, Abraham obtained what was promised after he had patiently waited.
