====== Genesis 28 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Even though Jacob tricked his father in order to receive Esau's blessing, the chapter repeats the blessing, ensuring he inherits the blessings promised to Abraham. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:bless]], [[:en:obe:kt:inherit]] and [[:en:obe:kt:promise]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Jacob's dream ==
Jacob had a dream or received a vision. The purpose of this dream is to show that, despite Jacob's sin, God is giving Abraham's covenant promises to Jacob and his descendants. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]], [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]] and [[:en:obe:kt:promise]])

== Bethel ==
This was an important city for Abraham and his descendants. It is possible that there is some theological significance to the city of Bethel.
