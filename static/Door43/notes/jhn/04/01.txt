\v 1-2 \add At that time, many people were asking\add* Jesus to baptize them. He did not baptize people; it was \add we\add* his disciples who were doing the baptizing. But when some of the Pharisee \add religious group\add* heard \add people say that\add* Jesus was making more disciples than John \add the Baptizer\add* and was baptizing them, \add they became very jealous\add*.
\v 3 When the Lord \add Jesus\add* heard about that, \add so that the Pharisees would not cause trouble for him\add*, he left Judea \add district\add*, and went again \add with us disciples\add* to Galilee district.

<usfm>
\v 1 Jesus got a report about the Pharisees. They found out that Jesus was gaining more followers than John the Baptizer and that he was baptizing more people than John was.
\v 2 But Jesus himself was not personally doing the work of baptizing; his disciples were doing that.
\v 3 So Jesus and his disciples left the region of Judea and returned once more to Galilee.

\v 2 (although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were),

  * **General Information:** - This is the next part of the story which is about Jesus and a Samaritan woman. These verses give background information for this part of the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

  * **Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was making ... John (although ... were), he left ... Galilee** - "Now Jesus was making ... John (although ... were), and the Pharisees had heard about the success he was having. He learned that the Pharisees had heard, so he left ... Galilee"
  * **Now when Jesus knew** - The word "now" is used here to mark a break in the main events. Here John starts to tell a new part of the narrative. 
  * **Jesus himself was not baptizing** - The reflexive pronoun "himself" adds emphasis that it was not Jesus who was baptizing, but his disciples. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
