===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here the scene shifts to a different time and place and tells of Jesus healing another person.

  * **Jesus had come** - The disciples were probably with Jesus, but the focus of the story is on what Jesus said and did, so introduce the disciples only if needed to avoid wrong meaning.
  * **Peter's mother-in-law** - "the mother of Peter's wife"
  * **the fever left her** - If your language would understand this personification to mean that the fever could think and act on its own, this can be translated as "she became better" or "Jesus healed her." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **got up** - "got out of bed"
