====== 2 Corinthians 05 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== New bodies in heaven ==
Paul knows, when he dies, he will receive a much better body. Because of this, he is not afraid of being killed for preaching the Good News. So he tells others that they too can be reconciled to God. Christ will take away their sin and give them his righteousness. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:goodnews|Good News]], [[:en:obe:kt:reconcile|reconciled]], [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] and [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteousness]])

== New creation ==

The new creation and the old is probably a reference to Paul's illustrations of the old and new self. These concepts are also equivalent to the old and new man. The term "old" probably not a reference to the sinful nature that a person is born with, but is a reference to the old way of living or the Christian's former bondage to sin. The "new creation" is the new nature or new life that is given to a person after they come to faith in Christ. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Home ==
The Christian's home is no longer in the world. A Christian's home is in heaven. This is a common metaphor used in Scripture. The use of this imagery in this chapter emphasizes the temporariness of the Christian's circumstances. It gives hope to those who are suffering. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:heaven]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:hope]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "The message of reconciliation" ==
This is a reference to the gospel. It is a call for those who are hostile to God, to repent and be reconciled to him. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:repent]] and [[:en:obe:kt:reconcile]]
)
