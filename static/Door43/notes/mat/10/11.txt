\v 11 In any town or village that you enter, find a person who wants you to stay in his home.
\v 12 As you go into that house, call upon God to do good to the people who live there. Stay in that home until you leave that town or village.
\v 13 If the people who live in that house receive you well, God will indeed do good to them. But if they do not receive you well, then your prayer will not help them, and God will not do them good.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about what they should do when they go out to preach.

  * **you ... your** - These are plural and refer to the twelve apostles. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Whatever city or village you enter** - "Whenever you enter a city or village" or "Every city or village you go into"
  * **city ... village** - "large village ... small village" or "large town ... small town." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:09:35|9:35]].
  * **worthy ... not worthy** - In 10:11-13 a "worthy" person refers to a person who is willing to welcome the disciples. Jesus compares this person to one who is "not worthy," a person who does not welcome the disciples.
  * **stay there until you leave** - The full meaning of the statement can be made explicit. AT: "stay in that person's house until you leave the town or village" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **As you enter into the house, greet it** - The phrase "greet it" means greet the house. A common greeting in those days was "Peace be to this house!" Here "house" refers to the people who live in the house. AT: "As you enter into the house, greet the people who live in it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the house is worthy** - Here "house" refers to those who live in the house. AT: "the people who live in that house receive you well" (UDB) or "the people who live in that house treat you well" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **let your peace come upon it** - The word "it" means the house. Here "house" refers to the people who live in the house. AT: "let peace come upon it" or "the people who live in that house will live in peace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **your peace** - This is the peace the apostles are to ask God to bring upon the people in the house.
  * **if it is not worthy** - The word "it" means the house. Here "house" refers to the people who live in the house. AT: "if they do not receive you well" (UDB) or "if they do not treat you well" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **let your peace come back to you** - Possible meanings are 1) if the household was not worthy, then God would hold back peace or blessings from that household or 2) if the household was not worthy, then the apostles were supposed to do something, such as asking God not to honor their greeting of peace. If your language has a similar meaning of taking back a greeting or its effects, that should be used here.
