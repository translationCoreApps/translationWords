===== translationNotes: =====
  * **before Yahweh** - "in the presence of Yahweh" or "to Yahweh"
  * **lay his hand on the head** - This is a symbolic action that identifies the person with the animal he is offering. In this way the person is offering himself to Yahweh through the animal. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:01:03|1:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **the sons of Aaron will sprinkle its blood** - It is implied that before they sprinkle the blood, they catch the blood in a bowl as it drains from the animal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **will offer his sacrifice made by fire** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "will offer his sacrifice by fire" or "will burn his sacrifice" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
