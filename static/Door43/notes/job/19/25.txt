\v 25 But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives,
\q and that at last he will stand on the earth;
\q
\v 26 after my skin, that is, this body, is destroyed,
\q then in my flesh I will see God.
\q
\v 27 I will see him myself;
\q my eyes—and not someone else—will see him.
\q My kidneys fail within me

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Job continues to speak to his three friends.

  * **my Redeemer** - Here "Redeemer" refers to a person who will rescue Job by proving Job's innocence, restoring his honor, and giving him justice. AT: "My Defender" 
  * **at last he will stand on the earth** - This refers to standing to speak in court. Possible meanings are 1) the Redeemer will be the last one to speak in the court. AT: "he will judge whether or not I am guilty" or 2) the Redeemer will stand in this final court to defend Job. AT: "at last he will defend me in court"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **after my skin ... is destroyed** - Possible meanings are this refers to 1) his body being destroyed by disease or 2) his body decaying after he has died. 
  * **in my flesh I will see God** - His flesh represents his body, and "in my flesh" represents being alive. AT: "While I live in my body, I will see God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **my eyes—and not someone else—will see him** - The phrase "my eyes" represents Job. The phrases "My eyes" and "and not someone else" emphasize that Job will actually see God. It is not that someone else will see God and tell Job about him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **My kidneys fail within me** - People thought of the kidneys as being where the emotions are. So the kidneys failing represents him having very many emotions.

  * **My kidneys fail within me** - Possible meanings are that 1) Job feels very hopeful, thankful, and happy or 2) Job feels exhausted waiting to see his Redeemer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
