===== translationNotes: =====

  * **she became a pillar of salt** - "she became like a statue of salt" or "her body became like a tall stone of salt." Because she disobeyed the angel who told them not to look back at the city, God caused her to become something like a statue made out of rock salt.
  * **behold** - The word "behold" draws attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **like the smoke of a furnace** - This shows that it was a very large amount of smoke. AT: "like the smoke from a very large fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
