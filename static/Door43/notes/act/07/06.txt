\v 6 God was speaking to him like this, that his descendants would live for a while in a foreign land, and that the inhabitants there would bring them into slavery and treat them badly for four hundred years.
\v 7 'And I will judge the nation to which they will be slaves,' said God, 'and after that they will come out and worship me in this place.'
\v 8 And he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision, so Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of the twelve patriarchs.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will judge the nation** - "nation" refers to the people in it. AT: "I will judge the people of the nation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to which they will be slaves** - "to which your descendants will be slaves"
  * **gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision** - The Jews would have understood that this covenant required Abraham to circumcise the males of his family. AT: "made a covenant with Abraham to circumcise the males of his family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **so Abraham became the father of Isaac** - The story transitions to Abraham's descendants.
  * **and Jacob the father** - "and Jacob became the father." Stephen shortened this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
