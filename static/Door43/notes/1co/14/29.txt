====== 1 Corinthians 14:29-30 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 \add During a meeting\add*, two or three people should speak messages that come directly from God, and others who are there should think carefully about what those people have said.
\v 30 If someone receives a new message directly from God while someone else is speaking, the one who is speaking should stop speaking \add and let the other person tell what God has revealed to him\add*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 If there are any who want to speak a message from God, there should be only two or three such persons; and everyone else should judge those messages according to what the scriptures say.
\v 30 But if God allows someone seated in the assembly to understand a message, then the one speaking the message should stop speaking. In this way, all the believers can listen to the meaning of the message.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others listen with discernment to what is said.
\v 30 But if an insight is given to one who is sitting in the service, let the one who had been speaking be silent.
