===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 To you who are married, I say this: do not seek to be freed from your vow. As for you who are not married, do not try to find a wife.
\v 28 But to the men who are single, I say, if you marry, you have committed no sin. I give the same advice to the single women: if you get married, you have committed no sin. However, if you marry, you will find many troubles, so I advise you to remain single.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 Are you bound to a woman? Do not seek to be free of her. Are you free of a wife? Do not seek a wife.
\v 28 But if you do marry, you have not committed a sin. And if an unmarried woman marries, she has committed no sin. Yet those who marry will have many kinds of trouble while living, and I would like to spare you from them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Are you bound ... Do not seek ... Are you free ... Do not seek ... you do ... you have** - Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so all these instances of "you" and the command "do not seek" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Are you bound to a woman? Do not seek** - Paul addresses men who are married. AT: "If you are married, do not seek" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Are you free of a wife? Do not seek** - Paul addresses men who are not married. AT: "If you are not now married, do not seek" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do not seek a wife** - "Do not try to get married"
  * **committed** - "done"
  * **I would like to spare you from them** - "I do not want you to have them"
