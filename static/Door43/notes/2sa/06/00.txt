====== 2 Samuel 06 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem ==
David organized a procession with many musical instruments to bring the ark to Jerusalem. They put it on a cart; but when the oxen stumbled, Uzzah reached out to steady it so it would not fall. God killed him for touching the ark. David was angry at God for killing Uzzah and was afraid to bring the ark any further. Uzzah died because the Ark was perfectly holy. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:holy]])

== Dancing ==
David danced for joy in front of the Ark. His wife, Michal, criticized David for uncovering himself as he danced but David did not care. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:joy]]) 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Irony ==
Michal criticized David by using irony: "How honored the king of Israel was today, who undressed himself today before the eyes of the slave girls among his servants, like one of the crude fellows who shamelessly undresses himself!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
