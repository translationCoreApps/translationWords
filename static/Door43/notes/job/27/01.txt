===== translationNotes: =====

  * **As surely as God lives** - This phrase shows that Job is taking an oath. Job compares the certainty that God is alive to the certainty of what he is saying. This is a way of making a solemn promise. AT: "I swear by God"
  * **has taken away my justice** - Justice is spoken of as if it were an object that could be taken away or given. Taking it away represents refusing to treat Job with justice. AT: "has refused to treat me justly" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **made my life bitter** - Job's "life" being bitter represents Job feeling resentful toward God. AT: "has caused me to become resentful" or "has made me feel angry because of the unfair way he has treated me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **while my life is yet in me** - This refers to the duration of the rest of his life. AT: "during the whole time that my live is yet in me" or "as long as my life is yet in me"
  * **while my life is yet in me** - The abstract noun "life" can be expressed with the adjective "alive" or the verb "live." AT: "as long as I am still alive"  or "while I still live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the breath from God is in my nostrils** - Breath in the nostrils represents being able to breathe. And "breath from God" represents God making him able to breath. AT: "God enables me to breathe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
