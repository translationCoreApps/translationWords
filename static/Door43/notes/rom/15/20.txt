\v 20 As I proclaim that message, I am always eagerly trying to proclaim it in places where people have not already heard about Christ. I do that in order that I might not be simply continuing the work that someone else already started. I do not want to be like a man who builds a house on someone else's foundation.
\v 21 On the contrary, I teach non-Jews, so that what happens may be like what was written: "The people who have never heard any news about the Christ, they will see him. Those who have never heard of him will understand about him."

\v 20 In this way, my desire has been to proclaim the gospel, but not where Christ is known by name, in order that I might not build upon another man's foundation.
\v 21 It is as it is written:
\q "Those to whom no tidings of him came will see him,
\q and those who have not heard will understand."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **In this way, my desire has been to proclaim the gospel, but not where Christ is known by name** - Paul only wants to preach to people who have never heard of Christ. AT: "Because of this, I want to preach the good news in places where people have never heard of Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **in order that I might not build upon another man's foundation** - Paul speaks of his ministry work as if he were building a house on a foundation. AT: "in order that I might not be simply continuing the work that someone else already started. I do not want to be like a man who builds a house on someone else's foundation" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **It is as it is written** - Here Paul refers to what Isaiah wrote in the scriptures. You can translate this in an active form and make the meaning explicit. AT: "What is happening is like what Isaiah wrote in the scriptures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Those to whom no tidings of him came** - Here Paul speaks of the "tidings" or message about Christ as if it were alive and able to move by itself. AT: "Those whom no one had told the news about him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
