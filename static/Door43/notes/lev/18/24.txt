===== translationNotes: =====


  * **the nations are defiled** - This refers to the people groups already living in Canaan. Translate this so the term "nations" is clarified as people. AT: "the people of the nations defiled themselves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The land became defiled** - "The people defiled the land"
  * **the land vomited out its inhabitants** - Yahweh forcibly removing the people from the land is spoken of as if the land were a person who vomited the people out. AT: "I forcibly removed the people from the land, like a person vomits up food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
