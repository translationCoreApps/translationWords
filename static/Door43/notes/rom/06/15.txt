\v 15 \add I suppose that certain people might think about what I have just said and they might\add* say \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, "\add You say that\add* the laws \add God gave Moses\add* did not \add enable us to stop sinning, but that God is now\add* treating us kindly in ways we do not deserve. \add That seems to mean that God permits\add* us to continue sinning.\f + \ft Or: \add Does that mean that God permits\add* us to continue sinning? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" My reply to that is no, we should certainly not continue \add sinning\add*!
\v 16 \add Slaves\add* have to obey\add what their masters command\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add them to do\add*. I want you to remember this.\f + \ft Or:  Do you not know this? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Similarly, if you present yourselves to someone \add in order to\add* obey him, you will be the slaves \f + \ft metaphor \f* of the person you obey. Similarly, \add if you have yielded yourselves to do the\add* sinful things \add you desire\add*, you are slaves of your sinful desires \f + \ft personification \f*, and you will be eternally separated from God. \add If you have yielded yourselves\add* to obey \add God\add*, you are slaves of God and you need to \add live\add* righteously.

\v 15 We might think from this that because the laws God gave Moses did not enable us to stop sinning and God is now treating us kindly anyway, that God permits us to continue sinning. Absolutely not!
\v 16 If you offer to obey someone, you become his slaves. If you obey when you wish to sin, then you become the slaves of sin and die as a result. But if you obey God, then you become his slaves and, as a result, will do the right things that God wants you to do.

\v 15 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be.
\v 16 Do you not know that the one to whom you present yourselves as servants is the one to which you are obedient, the one you must obey? This is true whether you are servants to sin which leads to death, or servants to obedience which leads to righteousness.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be** - Paul is using a question to emphasize that living under grace is not a reason to sin. AT: "However, just because we are bound to grace instead of the law of Moses certainly does not mean we are allowed to sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **May it never be** - "We would never want that to happen!" or "May God help me not to do that!" This expression shows an extremely strong desire that this does not take place. You may have a similar expression in your language that you could use here. See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:03:31|3:31]].
  * **Do you not know that the one to whom you present yourselves as servants is the one to which you are obedient, the one you must obey?** - Paul uses a question to scold anyone who may think God's grace is a reason to keep sinning. You can translate this as a strong statement. AT: "You should know that you are slaves to the master you choose to obey!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **This is true whether you are servants to sin which leads to death, or servants to obedience which leads to righteousness** - Here, Paul describes "sin" and "obedience" as masters that a slave would serve. AT: "You are either a slave to sin, which results in spiritual death, or you are a slave to obedience, which results in doing the things that God wants you to do (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
