===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These verses continue the "thirty sayings" ([[:en:bible:notes:pro:22:20|22:20]]). It is the continuation of the description of a drunk person. 

  * **lies on the top of a mast** - The place on the mast where the person lies can be made explicit. AT: "lies in the basket near the top of a mast" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **mast** - the long wooden pole to which are attached the sails of a sailing ship
  * **They hit me, ... but I was not hurt. They beat me, but I did not feel it.** - Because the drunk person is not thinking clearly, he is imagining that people are hitting and beating him, yet he feels no pain and cannot remember anything.
  * **When will I wake up?** - The drunk person is wondering when he will be sober again; when the effect of the wine will stop.
