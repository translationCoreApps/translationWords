\v 18 Now listen to me explain the parable I told you.
\v 19 Some people hear about how God is ruling but do not understand it. They are like the path where some of the seeds fell. Satan, the evil one, comes and causes these people to forget what they have heard.

\v 18 Listen then to the parable of the sower.
\v 19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is the seed that was sown beside the road.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here Jesus begins to explain to his disciples the parable about a person who sows seeds, which he began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:03|13:3]].

  * **the word of the kingdom** - Here "word" refers to a message. And, "kingdom" refers to God's rule as king. AT: "the message about God's rule as king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart** - Jesus combines the imagery of the bird snatching the seed and Satan causing the person to forget what he has heard. AT: "Satan causes him to forget the message that he has heard just like the bird snatches away the seed and devours it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **snatches away** - Try to use a word that means to grab something away from someone who is the rightful owner.
  * **what has been sown in his heart** - This can be translated in active form: AT: "the message God sowed in his heart" or "the message he heard" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **in his heart** - Here "heart" refers to the mind of the hearer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **This is the seed that was sown beside the road** - If a literal translation makes no sense, try to translate so the reader understands that Jesus is the sower, the message is the seed, and the hearer is the soil on the wayside. AT: "This is how it is with the seed that the sower scattered on the wayside" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **beside the road** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:03|13:4]].
