\v 16 Then Yahweh brought leaders to them. These leaders rescued the Israelites from the people who were attacking them.
\v 17 But the Israelites still would not obey their leaders. Instead, they betrayed Yahweh for idols, like prostitutes to other gods and they worshiped those idols. They were not like their ancestors. Their ancestors obeyed what Yahweh commanded, but these new people quickly stopped behaving as their ancestors had behaved.

\v 16 Then Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who were stealing their possessions.
\v 17 Yet they would not listen to their judges. They were unfaithful to Yahweh and gave themselves like prostitutes to other gods and worshiped them. They soon turned aside from the way their fathers had lived— those who had obeyed the commandments of Yahweh—but they themselves did not do so.
