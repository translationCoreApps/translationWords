===== translationNotes: =====

  * **sixty years old and up** - "sixty years old and older"
  * **sixty ... fifteen ... ten** - "60 ... 15 ... 10" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **fifteen shekels** - If it is necessary to use modern weight units, here are two ways of doing it. AT: "fifteen pieces of silver" or "150 grams of silver" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]])
  * **and for a female ten shekels** - The phrases "of that age" and "your standard value must be" are left out, but are meant to be understood. AT: "and for a female of that age your standard value must be ten shekels" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the person being given must be presented to the priest** - This can be stated in active form. AT "he must present to the priest the person he is giving" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
