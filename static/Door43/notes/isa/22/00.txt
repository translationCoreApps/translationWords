====== Isaiah 22 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Repentance ==
On this day of judgment, Judah should be repenting of their sin. Instead, they are celebrating it. Although Judah avoids Yahweh's punishment through the Assyrians, their punishment will still come. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:judge]], [[:en:obe:kt:repent]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Valley of visions ==
This is a metaphor used in this prophecy against the nation of Judah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])
