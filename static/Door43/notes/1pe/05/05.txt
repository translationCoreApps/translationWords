\v 5 Now I will say this to you young men. You must obey the older men in the assembly. All of you believers should act humbly toward each other, because it is true that God opposes those who are proud, but he acts kindly toward those who are humble.
\p
\v 6 Therefore, realizing that God has great power to punish proud people, humble yourselves in order that he may honor you at the time that he has determined.
\v 7 Because he takes care of you, let him take care of all the things that you are worried about.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 In the same way, you younger men, submit to the older men. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility and serve one another. For God resists the proud, but he gives grace to the humble.
\v 6 Therefore humble yourselves under God's mighty hand so that he may lift you up in due time.
\v 7 Cast all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Peter gives an instruction specifically to younger men and then continues to instruct all of the believers.

  * **In the same way** - This refers back to the way the elders submitted to the Chief Shepherd in [[:en:bible:notes:1pe:05:01|5:1-4]].
  * **All of you** - This refers to all believers, not just the younger men.
  * **clothe yourselves with humility** - Peter speaks of having the moral quality of humility as putting on a piece of clothing. AT: "act humbly toward each other" (UDB) or "act with humility" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **under God's mighty hand** - Here the word "hand" refers to God's power to save the humble and punish the proud. AT: "under God's great power" or "before God, realizing that he has great power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Cast all your anxiety on him** - Peter speaks of anxiety as if it were a heavy burden that a person places on God, rather than carrying it himself. AT: "Trust him with everything that worries you" or "Let him take care of all the things that trouble you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
