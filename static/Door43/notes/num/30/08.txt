===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the vow that she has made ... the rash talk of her lips** - "the vow that she has made ... that is, the rash talk of her lips." These two phrases refers to the same thing. The second phrase describes the vow that the woman made. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the rash talk of her lips** - The phrase "the rash talk" refers to the rash promise that she made. The woman is referred to as "her lips" because lips are related to speech. AT: "the rash things she has said" or "her rash promise" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **with which she has bound herself** - Here Moses speaks of how a woman has committed herself to fulfilling a promise as if her promise were a physical object that she had bound to her body. AT: "which she has committed herself to fulfill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh will release her** - Here Moses speaks about Yahweh forgiving the woman of not forgiving her vow as if he were releasing her from something that bound her. AT: "Yahweh will forgive her" or "Yahweh will forgive her for not fulfilling her vow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
