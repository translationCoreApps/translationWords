\v 7 Because of that, after a while, his master's wife started to look fondly at Joseph. So one day she said to him, "Have sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with me!"
\v 8 But he refused, saying to his master's wife, "Listen! My master is not concerned about anything in this house. He has appointed me to take care of everything that he owns.
\v 9 No one in this household has more authority than I do. The only thing that he has not allowed me to have is you, because you are his wife! So how could I do this wicked thing that you are asking me to do?\f + \ft Or: I certainly could not do this wicked thing! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* I would be sinning against God if I did that!"

\v 7 It came about after this that his master's wife lusted for Joseph. She said, "Sleep with me."
\v 8 But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Look, my master does not pay attention to what I do in the house, and he has put everything that he owns under my care.
\v 9 No one is greater in this house than I am. He has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?"
