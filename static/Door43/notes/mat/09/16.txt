  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to answer the question that the disciples of John had asked.

  * **No man puts a piece of new cloth on an old garment** - This proverb means that people who know only the old traditions are not eager to accept new ones. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]])
  * **garment** - "clothing"
  * **the patch** - "the piece of new cloth." This is the piece of cloth used to cover a hole in the old garment.
  * **and a worse tear will be made** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "and this will make the tear worse" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
