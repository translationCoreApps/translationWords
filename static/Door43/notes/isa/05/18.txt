===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Woe to those who pull along iniquity with useless cords and who pull along sin as if it were with a cart rope** - These phrases mean basically the same thing. They speak of people who continue to sin on purpose as if they were using all their strength to pull a heavy cart along. God will punish them for their sin. AT: "Woe to those who work hard to sin as a person who drags a cart by a rope" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **those who say** - This refers to those who continue to sin (verse 18) and then mockingly challenge God to stop them. AT: "those mockers who say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **let the plans of the Holy One of Israel come** - God's plans are spoken of as if they were objects that could come by themselves. AT: "let the Holy One of Israel accomplish his plans" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the Holy One of Israel** - Translate "the Holy One" as in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:05:15|5:16]].
