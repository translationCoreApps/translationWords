===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - This word shows that the writer is beginning a new part of the story.
  * **the whole earth** - all the people on the earth (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **used one language and had the same words** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that all people spoke the same language. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **journeyed** - "migrated" or "moved around"
  * **in the east** - Possible meanings are 1) "in the east" or 2) "from the east" or 3) "to the east." The preferred choice is "in the east" because Shinar is to the east of where scholars believe the ark came to rest.
  * **settled** - stopped moving from one place to another and began to live at one location
