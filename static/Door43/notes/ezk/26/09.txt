\v 9 The king will direct the soldiers who operate the rams to batter the wall, and those who will use iron bars to tear down the towers in the wall.
\v 10 The king will have a huge number of horses, and the stamping of their hooves will raise dust to cover the whole city. It will be as though the walls tremble because of the noise made by the horses, the supply wagons, and the chariots when they enter the city where the enemy has broken down the walls.
\v 11 The horses will trample all of the streets of the city with their hooves. The soldiers will kill the people with their swords; they will cause the monuments that celebrated their strength to collapse.

<usfm>
\v 9 He will place his battering rams to hit against your walls, and his tools will tear down your towers.
\v 10 So you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, 'You are saying this, "Our transgressions and our sins are on us, and we are decaying in them. How can we live?"'
\v 11 Say to them, 'As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—I do not delight in the death of the wicked, for if the wicked repents from his way, then he will live. Repent! Repent from your wicked ways. For why should you die, house of Israel?'
