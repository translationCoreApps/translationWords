===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is hospitality? ===

Hospitality was an important concept in the ancient Near East. It was important to be friendly towards a foreigner or outsider and provide help to them if they needed it. In 2 John, John discourages Christians from showing hospitality to false teachers who oppose the Christian faith. In 3 John, John encourages Christians to show hospitality to faithful teachers.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How does the author use family relationships? ===

The author uses the terms "brother" and "Gentile" in a way that can be confusing. The Scriptures often use the term "brothers" to refer to Jews, but in this book the term is used to refer to Christians. Likewise, John as his "children" those whom he has trained to follow Christ. John also uses the term "Gentile" as a way to refer to those who have no faith in Jesus.
