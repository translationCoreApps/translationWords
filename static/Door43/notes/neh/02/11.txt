====== Nehemiah 02:11-12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11-12 When I arrived in Jerusalem, I did not tell anyone what thoughts God had given to me about what I should do there. Three days after I arrived in Jerusalem, I went out of the city in the evening, taking a few men with me. I was riding a donkey; we had no other animals with us.

\v 11 So I came to Jerusalem and stayed there three days.
\v 12 I went out of the city in the evening, and I took a few men with me. We only had one animal, the one that I was riding on. I said nothing to anyone about what God had inspired me to do in Jerusalem.
