====== Hebrews 07:22-24 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Because of that, Jesus guarantees that \add the new\add* covenant will be better \add than the old one\add*.
\p
\v 23 And formerly, the priests could not keep serving \add as priests\add*, because they all died \f + \ft personification \f*. So there were many priests \add to take the place of the ones who died\add*.
\v 24 But because \add Jesus\add* lives eternally, he will continue to be a high priest forever.

\v 22 Because of that, Jesus himself guarantees that the new covenant will be better than the old one.
\p
\v 23 And formerly, priests could not keep serving as priests because they would always die. So there were many priests to take the place of the ones who died.
\v 24 But because Jesus lives eternally, he will continue to be a high priest forever.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 22 By this also Jesus has given the guarantee of a better covenant.
\v 23 On one hand, many become priests because by death they are kept from continuing on.
\v 24 On the other hand, because Jesus remains forever, he has a permanent priesthood.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The writer then assures these Jewish believers that Christ has the better priesthood because he lives forever and the priests that descended from Aaron all died.

  * **guarantee** - "assurance" or "certainty"
  * **On one hand ... On the other hand** - These phrases are used to compares two things. Your language may have a way to emphasize that the author is making a comparison. Or you could leave out the first "On one hand" and translate the second "On the other hand" simply as "But."
  * **by death they are kept from continuing on** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "they eventually die and cannot continue on" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **he has a permanent priesthood** - A priest's work is spoken of as if it were an object that Jesus possessed. This can be worded avoiding the abstraction. AT: "he is a priest permanently" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
