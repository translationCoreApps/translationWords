\v 4 Truly, all the Jews know how I lived from my youth in my own nation and at Jerusalem.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **all the Jews know how I lived ... at Jerusalem** - Possible meanings are 1) Pharisees who grew up with Paul and knew him as a Pharisee or 2) Paul was well known among the Jews due to his zeal as a Pharisee and now as a believer.
  * **all the Jews** - This is an exaggeration that emphasizes that many Jews know about Paul. AT: "many Jews" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **in my own nation** - Possible meanings are 1) among his own people, not necessarily in the geographical land of Israel or 2) in the land of Israel.
