===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Again, the next day** - This is another day. It is the second day that John saw Jesus.
  * **Lamb of God** - This is a metaphor that represents God's perfect sacrifice. Jesus is called the "Lamb of God" because he was sacrificed to pay for people's sins. See how you translated this same phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:01:29|1:29]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
