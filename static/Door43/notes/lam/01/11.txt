===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 All her people groan as they search for bread.
\q They have given their precious treasures for food to restore their lives.
\q Look, Yahweh, and consider me, for I have become worthless.
\q
\v 12 Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?
\q Look and see if there is anyone else's sorrow like the sorrow that is being inflicted on me,
\q since Yahweh has tormented me on the day of his fierce anger.
