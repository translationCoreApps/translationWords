====== Job 12 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. This chapter is Job's response to Zophar.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Job's righteousness ==
Despite being upset about his circumstances, Job does not curse God. His friends, on the other hand, judge Job's case, which Job recognizes to be Yahweh's authority. These three friends therefore try to take God's place. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:curse]] and [[:en:obe:kt:judge]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
Job uses many different metaphors in this chapter to express his pain or despair. He is also upset with the advice of his friends, who are supposed to help him during difficult times. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

== Rhetorical questions ==
Job uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter in order to try to convince Zophar that he is wrong. These questions help to build Job's response. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
