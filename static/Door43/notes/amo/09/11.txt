\v 11 In that day I will raise up the tent of David that has fallen,
\q and close up its breaches.
\q I will raise up its ruins,
\q and rebuild it as in the days of old,
\q
\v 12 That they may possess the remnant of Edom,
\q and all the nations that are called by my name
\q â€”this is the declaration of Yahweh, who does this.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **tent ... breaches ... ruins** - After Yahweh destroys the kingdom of Israel, it will be like a tent whose wooden poles have collapsed, a wall that has been broken down in some places, and a house that has been torn down. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **breaches** - parts of a wall that have fallen down
  * **ruins** - what is left when a building is destroyed
  * **the remnant of Edom** - Either what Israel has not yet conquered in the region or of the people of Edom.
