====== Isaiah 38 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 38:10-20, which is an extended prayer.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Poetry ==
This chapter is written as a narrative, but the section including Hezekiah's prayer is written as poetry. The tone of this prayer shifts from sorrow to praise.
