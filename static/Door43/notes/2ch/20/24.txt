===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Behold, they were dead** - This was a surprise. All their enemies had destroyed each other.
  * **they were dead, fallen to the ground** - The phrase "fallen to the ground" is an idiomatic way to say that "they were dead." AT: "they were all dead on the ground." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
