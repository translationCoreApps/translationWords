<usfm>
\v 14 If someone borrows an animal, and if that animal is hurt or dies when its owner is not there, the one who borrowed it must pay the owner for the animal.
\v 15 But if that happens when the owner of the animal is there, the one who borrowed it will not have to pay back anything. If the man who borrowed it only rented it, the money that he paid to rent it will be enough to pay for the animal \add dying or being injured\add*."

\v 14 If a man borrows any animal from his neighbor and the animal is injured or dies without the owner being with it, the other man must surely make restitution.
\v 15 But if the owner was with it, the other man will not have to pay; if the animal was hired, it will be paid for by its hiring fee.
