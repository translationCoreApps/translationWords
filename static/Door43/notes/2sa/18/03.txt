\v 3 But his soldiers said, "No, we will not allow you to go with us. If they force us to all run away, they will not be concerned about that. Or if they kill half of us, they will also not be what they want. To them, \add capturing\add* you is more important than \add capturing\add* ten thousand of us. So it will be better that you \add stay here\add* in the city and send help to us."
\p
\v 4 The king replied to them, "Okay, I will do whatever seems best to you." So he stood at the gate \add and watched\add* while his soldiers marched out, group by group.

\v 3 But his soldiers said, "No, we will not allow you to go with us. If they force us to all run away, they will not be concerned about us. Or if they kill half of us, they will not care about that, either. To them, capturing you is more important than capturing ten thousand of us. So it would be better that you stay here in the city and send help to us."
\p
\v 4 The king replied to them, "Very well, I will do whatever seems best to you." So he stood at the city gate and watched while his soldiers marched out, group by group.

\v 3 But the men said, "You must not go to battle, for if we flee away they will not care about us, or if half of us die they will not care. But you are worth ten thousand of us! Therefore it is better that you be ready to help us from the city."
\v 4 So the king answered them, "I will do whatever seems best to you." The king stood by the city gate while all the army went out by hundreds and by thousands.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **half of us** - The word "half" refers to one out of two equal parts. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **you are worth ten thousand of us** - This means that the enemy army considering killing David of greater worth than killing 10,000 of the other men. The number 10,000 here is an exaggeration used to emphasize a very great number of people. AT: "they would rather kill you than to kill 10,000 of us" or "killing you is worth more to them than killing a great number of us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **ten thousand** - "10,000" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **that you be ready to help us from the city** - David could help them from the city by advising them and sending men to help them. This can be stated clearly. AT: "that you stay here in the city and send help to us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
