\v 23 Then when his disciples were alone with him, he turned toward them and said, "God has given you a great gift by letting you see the things that I have done!
\v 24 I want you to know that many prophets and kings who lived long ago desired to see the things that you are seeing me do, but they could not, because those things did not happen then. They longed to hear the things that you have been hearing me say, but I had not yet revealed those things at that time."
