\v 12 They will take away all the people's valuable possessions and steal the things that the merchants sell. They will tear down the walls of the houses and destroy their fine houses. Then they will throw into the sea the stones \add from the walls\add* of those houses and the timber and the rubble.
\v 13 No longer will you sing noisy songs, and people will not play their harps anymore.
\v 14 They will cause the city to become a bare rock and \add only\add* a place where men spread their fishing nets. And the city will never be rebuilt. \add Those things will surely happen\add* because I, Yahweh the Lord, have declared \add that they will happen\add*.

\v 12 And you, son of man, say to your people, 'The righteousness of a righteous person will not save him if he sins. And the wickedness of a wicked person will not cause him to perish if he repents from his sin. For the righteous person will not be able to live because of his righteousness if he sins.
\v 13 If I say to the righteous, "He will surely live." and if he trusts in his righteousness and then commits injustice, I will not call to mind any of his righteousness; he will die in the wickedness that he has committed.
\v 14 And if I say to the wicked, "You will surely die." but if he then repents from his sins and does what is just and right, this is the promise for you.
