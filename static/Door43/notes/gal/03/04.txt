===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Keep in mind that \add if what God has done for you was because of your obeying the laws that God gave to Moses and\add* not because of trusting in Christ, when others caused you to suffer, you suffered many things needlessly!\f + \ft Or: did you not suffer many things needlessly? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add I certainly hope that you did not suffer like that\add* needlessly.
\v 5 \add When God now\add* generously gives to you his Spirit and performs miracles among you, \add do you think that it is\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* because you obey the laws \add that God gave to Moses? Surely you know that\add* it is because when you heard \add the good message about Christ\add*, you trusted in him \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 All the things you experienced after you believed in Christ—whether good things or bad things—they would have been of no value at all if you had not been trusting in him.
\v 5 When God now generously gives to you his Spirit and performs mighty deeds among you, do you think that it is because you obey God's law? Surely you know it is because when you heard the good news about Christ, you trusted in him!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Did you experience so many things for nothing—if indeed it was for nothing?
\v 5 Then does he who gives the Spirit to you and works powerful deeds among you do it by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Did you experience so many things for nothing—if indeed it was for nothing?** - Paul asks a rhetorical question to remind the Galatians of the good things and bad things that had happened to them. AT: "Surely there was some good reason for which you went through these experiences! It was certainly not for nothing!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **experience so many things** - Possible meanings are 1) "experience so many good and bad things" or 2) "suffer so much" persecution because of their original commitment to Christ or 3) "work so hard" to keep the law.
  * **if indeed it was for nothing** - Possible meanings are 1) "it would have been of no value at all if you had not been trusting in him" (UDB) or 2) "if the work you did was only for nothing," meaning that the Galatians were working hard to keep the law and they were depending on works, not on Christ, and God would not count them as believers.
  * **does he ... do it by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?** - Paul asks another rhetorical question to remind the Galatians how people receive the Spirit. AT: "he ... does not do it by the works of the law; he does it by hearing with faith." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **by the works of the law** - "by doing what the law tells us to do"
  * **by hearing with faith** - Your language may require that what the people heard and whom they trusted be stated explicitly. AT: "by listening to the message and putting our trust in Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
