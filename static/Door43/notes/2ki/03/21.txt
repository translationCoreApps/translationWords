\v 21 Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, and they stood at the border.
\v 22 They awakened early in the morning and the sun reflected on the water. When the Moabites saw the water opposite them, it looked as red as blood.
\v 23 They exclaimed, "This is blood! The kings have certainly been destroyed, and they have killed each other! So now, Moab, let us go plunder them!"
