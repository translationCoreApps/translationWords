\v 6 So the king got his chariot and his army ready.
\v 7 Then he selected six hundred of the best chariots, and in each chariot he placed a driver, a soldier, and a commander, and they left. Other chariots, with a driver and a soldier in each of them, also went along.
\v 8 Because Yahweh made the king of Egypt so stubborn that he and his army went to pursue the Israelites, who were leaving triumphantly,
\v 9 the Egyptian army, with all the king's horses and chariots and horsemen, pursued the Israelites. They caught up with them as they were camped near the sea, close to Pi-Hahiroth, in front of Baal-Zephon.

\v 6 Then Pharaoh got his chariots ready and took his army with him.
\v 7 He took six hundred chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers on all of them.
\v 8 Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and the king pursued the Israelites. Now the Israelites had gone away in triumph.
\v 9 But the Egyptians pursued them, together with all his horses and chariots, his horsemen, and his army. They overtook the Israelites camping by the sea beside Pi Hahiroth, before Baal Zephon.
