===== translationNotes: =====

  * **called to** - "shouted" or "yelled"
  * **Must the sword devour forever?** - This rhetorical question emphasizes that they had fought for a long time and can be translated as a statement. AT: "We do not need to keep using our swords to fight and kill each other." A "sword" cannot literally eat. When it is said to eat or "devour," it means taking part in warfare and killing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **Do you not know it will be bitter in the end? How long will it be before you tell your men to stop pursuing their brothers?** - This rhetorical question is intended for emphasis and can be translated as a statement.  Here "brother" is used to represent the members of the nation of Israel. AT: "You know very well that when this ends we will all feel like we have eaten something bitter. Stop this now so that Israelites will not have to kill each other." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] ) 
  * **as God lives** - This is a very strong vow. AT: "with God as my witness" or "God will affirm that I mean what I say"
  * **if you had not said that** - This refers to what Abner has said to Joab about stopping the battle.
