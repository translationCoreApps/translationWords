They are like\add* people who do not want to lift \add even the slightest load\add* that they \add could lift\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\v 5 \add with\add* one finger. Whatever they do, they do it to be seen by other people \f + \ft Or:so that other people will see them doing that \f*. \add For example\add*, they make extra wide the tiny boxes containing portions of Scripture that they wear on their arms. They enlarge the tassels on their robes, \add to make others think that they are pious\add*.

\v 4 They require you to obey many rules that are difficult to obey. But they themselves do not help anyone obey those rules. It is as if they were tying up very heavy loads and putting them on your shoulders for you to carry. But they will not even move one finger to help you carry them.
\v 5 Whatever they do, they do those things so that other people will see them and admire them. For example, they make extra wide the tiny boxes containing portions of scripture that they wear on their arms. They enlarge the tassels on their robes to make others think that they honor God.

\v 4 Yes, they bind heavy burdens that are difficult to carry, and then they put them on people's shoulders. But they themselves will not move a finger to carry them.
\v 5 They do all their deeds to be seen by people. For they make their phylacteries wide, and they enlarge the edges of their garments.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they bind heavy burdens that are difficult to carry, and then they put them on people's shoulders** - Here "burdens" are the many rules that the religious leaders create. AT: "they make you obey many rules that are difficult to follow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they themselves will not move a finger** - Here "move a finger" is a metaphor for giving help. AT: "they will not give the least amount of help" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They do all their deeds to be seen by people** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "They do all their deeds so that people can see what they do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For they make their phylacteries wide, and they enlarge the edges of their garments** - Both of these are things the Pharisees do to appear as if they honor God more than other people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **phylacteries** - small leather boxes containing paper with scripture written on it
  * **they enlarge the edges of their garments** - Pharisees put long tassels on the bottom of their robes to show their devotion to God.
