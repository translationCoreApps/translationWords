\q
\v 8 For the destroyer will come to every city; no city will escape.
\q So the valley will perish and the plain will be devastated, as Yahweh has said.
\q
\v 9 Give wings to Moab, for she must certainly fly away.
\q Her cities will become a wasteland, where there is no one to live in them.
\q

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **So the valley will perish and the plain will be devastated** - These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that every part of the land will be destroyed. AT: "So the destroyer will destroy every city in the valleys and on the plains." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **Give wings to Moab** - This command is an exaggeration, because no one can put wings on people. Also, the idea of flying away represents the idea of rapidly running away. AT: "Help the people of Moab escape," "It would be good if the people of Moab had wings and could fly away." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **shedding blood** - AT: "killing people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
