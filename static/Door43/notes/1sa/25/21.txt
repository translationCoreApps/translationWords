\v 21 David had been saying to his men, "It was useless for us to protect that man and all his possessions here in this wilderness. We did not steal anything that belonged to him, but he has acted badly toward me in return for our good actions toward him.
\v 22 I hope that God will strike me and kill me if he or even one male person belonging to him is still alive tomorrow morning!"

<usfm>
\v 21 Now David had said, "Surely in vain have I guarded all that this man has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him, and he has returned me evil for good.
\v 22 May God do so to me, David, and more also, if by the morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer gives background information before he continues with the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

  * **Now David had said, "Surely ... to him."** - The reader needs to understand that David had said these things before he said, "Every man strap on his sword" in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:25:12|25:13]].
  * **Now David** - The word "Now" shows that the writer has stopped writing about Abigail and started writing about David. 
  * **nothing was missed of all that belonged to him** - This can be stated positively and in active form. AT: "he still has everything that was his" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **May God do so to me, David** - The Hebrew text has "May God strike the enemies of David," and some versions follow this. However, the reading of the ULB follows the main Greek tradition of the Old Testament, as some other modern versions do.
  * **all who belong** - "all the people who belong to him" or "those in his family"
