===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let there be light** - This is a command. By commanding that light should exist, God made it exist. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_imperative]])
  * **God saw the light, that it was good** - "God considered the light and was pleased with it." "Good" here means "pleasing" or "suitable."
  * **divided the light from the darkness** - "separated the light and the darkness" or "made it light at one time and dark at another." This refers to God creating the daytime and the night time.
  * **This was evening and morning, the first day** - God did these things on the first day that the universe existed.
  * **evening and morning** - This refers to the whole day. The writer speaks of the whole day as if it were these two parts. In the Jewish culture, a day begins when the sun sets. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
