They wait \add for\add* the crops \add to grow and mature before they can harvest them\add*.
\v 8 \add Similarly\add*, you also should \add wait\add* patiently and trust the Lord \add Jesus\add* firmly, because he is coming \add back\add* soon \add and will judge all people fairly\add*.

\v 7 So, my brothers and sisters, although rich people cause you to suffer, be patient until the Lord Jesus Christ comes back. Remember that when farmers plant a field, they wait for their valuable crops to grow. They must wait patiently for the rain that comes at the planting season and for more rain that comes just before the harvest season. They wait for the crops to grow and mature before they can harvest them.
\v 8 Similarly, you also should wait patiently and trust the Lord Jesus firmly, because he is coming back soon and will judge all people fairly.

\v 7 So be patient, brothers, until the Lord's coming. See, the farmer awaits the valuable harvest from the ground. He is patiently waiting for it, until it receives the early and late rains.
\v 8 You, too, be patient. Make your hearts strong, because the Lord's coming is near.
