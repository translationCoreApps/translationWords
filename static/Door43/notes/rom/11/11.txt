\v 11 If I should ask, "When the Jews sinned by not believing in Christ, did that mean they will always be apart from God?" I would reply, "No, they have certainly not separated themselves from God permanently! Instead, because they sinned, God is saving non-Jews in order to cause the Jews to envy the way he blesses non-Jews, so that they will ask Christ to save them."
\v 12 When the Jews rejected Christ, the result was that God abundantly blessed the other people in the world by offering them the opportunity to believe. And when the Jews failed spiritually, the result was that God abundantly blessed the non-Jews. Since that is true, think how wonderful it will be when the complete number of the Jews whom God has chosen will believe in Christ !

\v 11 I say then, "Did they stumble so as to fall?" May it never be. Instead, by their failure, salvation has come to the Gentiles, in order to provoke them to jealousy.
\v 12 Now if their failure is the riches of the world, and if their loss is the riches of the Gentiles, how much greater will their completion be?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - With Israel as a nation rejecting God, Paul warns the Gentiles to be careful they do not make the same mistake.

  * **Did they stumble so as to fall?** - Paul uses this question to add emphasis. AT: "Has God rejected them forever because they sinned?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **May it never be** - "That is not possible!" or "Certainly not!" This expression strongly denies that this could happen. You may have a similar expression in your language that you could use here. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:09:14|9:14]].
  * **provoke ... to jealousy** - Translate this phrase the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:10:19|10:19]].
  * **if their failure is the riches of the world, and if their loss is the riches of the Gentiles** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. If you need to, you can combine them in your translation. AT: "when the Jews failed spiritually, the result was that God abundantly blessed the non-Jews" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])  
  * **the riches of the world** - Because the Jews rejected Christ, God richly blessed the Gentiles by giving them the opportunity to receive Christ.
  * **the world** - Here the "world" is a metonym that refers to the people who live in the world, especially the Gentiles.
