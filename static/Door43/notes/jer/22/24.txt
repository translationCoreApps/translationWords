\v 24 Yahweh says this: "Jehoiachin, son of King Jehoiakim of Judah, as surely as I am alive, \add I will punish you\add*. Even if you were the ring on my finger that shows that I am the king, I would pull you off.
\v 25 You are afraid of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his huge army, because they are wanting to kill you. I will enable them to capture you.
\v 26 I will expel you and your mother \add from this land\add*, and you will be taken to another country. Neither of you were born there, but you will both die there.

\v 24 "As I live—this is Yahweh's declaration—even if you, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet on my right hand, I would tear you off.
\v 25 For I have given you to the hand of the ones seeking your life and to the hand of those before whom you are afraid, even to the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Chaldeans.
\v 26 I will throw you and your mother who bore you into another land, a country where you were not born, and there you will die.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **As I live** - "As surely as I am alive." Yahweh uses this expression to show that what he says next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **even if you ... were the signet on my right hand** - Yahweh speaks to Jehoiachin as if it were possible for him to be the ring on Yahweh's hand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **the signet on my right hand** - A signet ring was used by a king to place his seal of authority on documents. The signet ring therefore represents authority to rule. The right hand also represents authority to rule. AT: "the signet ring on my right hand that represented my authority to be king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I would tear you off** - "I would tear you off from my hand" or "I would quickly pull you off of my hand"

  * **to the hand of** - Here "hand" represents power and control.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **seeking your life** - This is an idiom that means "seeking to take your life." AT: "trying to kill you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
