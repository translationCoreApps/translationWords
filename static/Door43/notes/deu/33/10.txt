===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to bless the tribes of Israel; the blessings are short poems. He continues to describe the tribe of Levi, which he began to do in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:33:08|33:8]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **your ... your ... you ... your** - Moses is speaking to Yahweh, so all these words are singular.
