===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Susa** - Use the same name used in [[:en:bible:notes:est:01:01|Esther 1:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **son of Jair son of Shimei son of Kish** - "Jair", "Shimei", and "Kish" are the men from whom "Mordecai" is the male descendant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Benjamite** - "of the tribe of Benjamin" (UDB)
  * **He had been taken away from Jerusalem** - The Hebrew text leaves unclear who is being spoken of here. It is perhaps Kish, who seems to have been the great-grandfather of Mordecai. If it was Mordecai himself, then he would be extremely old at the time of the events concerning Esther. Many modern versions leave this matter unclear. A few versions, including the UDB, choose to assume that it was Mordecai who had been taken away from Jerusalem.
  * **Jehoiachin, king of Judah** - (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
