====== Nahum 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:1-13, which is a poetic prophecy. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

Despite being divided into three chapters, the book contains one long prophecy. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Euphemism ==
This chapter speaks about the evils of the Assyrians in violent ways. It is important to avoiding toning down this language through the use of euphemism, if at all possible. Although there is some hyperbole, the reader should not assume that the author intends this writing to be taken as completely hyperbolic. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:obe:kt:evil]])
