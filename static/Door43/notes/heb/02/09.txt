\v 9 But we do know about Jesus, \add who truly has authority over everything!\add*


\p Jesus, for a little, while became inferior \add in rank\add* to angels in order to die on behalf of \f + \ft metaphor \f* everyone. He became inferior when he suffered \add and\add* died, as God in his kindness \add planned\add*. But now he has been greatly \add honored\add* \f + \ft doublet \f* \add by being\add* crowned \add as kings are\add*.
\v 10 It was fitting that \add God\add* make\add Jesus\add* perfect\f + \ft Or: all that God intended him to be \f*. He was enabling many people who would belong to him \f + \ft metaphor \f* to share his glory. God \add is the one who\add* created all things, and \add he is the one\add* for whom all things\add exist\add*. \add He perfected Jesus\add* by causing him to suffer \add and die\add*. \add Jesus\add* is the one who enables \add God\add* to save people.

\v 9 However, we do know about Jesus, who appeared in this life as a little less important than the angels. Because he suffered and died, God has made him the most important of all. He has made Jesus king over everything, because Jesus died for all mankind. It was because God was so kind to us that this happened.



\p
\v 10 It was proper that God should make Jesus complete in every way by suffering and dying for us. God is the one who created all things, and he is the one for whom all things exist. And Jesus is the one who enables God to save people.

\v 9 But we see the one who was made lower than the angels for a short amount of time: Jesus, who, because of his suffering and death, has been crowned with glory and honor. So now by God's grace, he has tasted death for every man.
\v 10 For it was proper for God, because everything exists for him and through him, to bring many sons to glory. It was proper for him to make the leader of their salvation complete through his sufferings.
