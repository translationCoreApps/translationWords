===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - After his opening greeting, James tells the believers that the purpose of trouble is to test faith.

  * **James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ** - The phrase "I am" is implied. AT: "I, James, am a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **James** - James was the half-brother of Jesus. 
  * **to the twelve tribes in the dispersion** - This expression refers either to all Jewish Christians living outside of Israel, or, more likely, to all Christians living anywhere in the world. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])  
  * **the twelve tribes** - The term "twelve tribes" normally stood for all the people of Israel, because they had been divided into twelve tribes. In this passage, however, "twelve tribes" stands either for all Jewish Christians or, more likely, for all Christians everywhere in the world. Here "twelve tribes" is used as a title, and the number "twelve" should be written as text, not as a numeral. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])  
  * **the dispersion** - The term "dispersion" normally referred to all Jews scattered in other countries, away from their homeland Israel. In this passage, however, "dispersion" stands either for all Jewish Christians living outside Israel, or, more likely, to all Christians everywhere in the world. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])  
  * **greetings** - a basic greeting, such as "hello" or "good day"
  * **Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you experience various troubles** - "My fellow believers, think of all your different kinds of troubles as something to celebrate"
  * **the testing of your faith produces endurance** - The expressions "the testing," "your faith," and "endurance" are nouns that stand for actions. God does the testing, that is, he finds out how much the believers trust and obey him. Believers ("you") believe in him and endure suffering. AT: "when you suffer hardships, God is finding out how much you trust him. As a result, you will become able to endure even more hardships" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
