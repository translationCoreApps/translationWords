===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He will lay** - "The ruler will lay"
  * **lay his hand on the head** - This is a symbolic action that identifies the person with the animal he is offering. In this way the person is offering himself to Yahweh through the animal. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:01:03|1:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **where they kill** - "where the priests kill"
  * **before Yahweh** - "in the presence of Yahweh" or "to Yahweh"
  * **The priest will take the blood** - It is implied that the priest will catch the blood in a bowl as the blood drains from the goat. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **horns of the altar** - This refers to the corners of the altar. They are shaped like the horns of an ox. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:04:06|4:7]].
