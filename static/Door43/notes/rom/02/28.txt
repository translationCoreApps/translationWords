\v 28 It is not those who perform rituals  \add to show they are God's people\add* who are  \add true\add* Jews, and it is not being circumcised in their bodies  \add that causes God to accept them\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 29 On the contrary, we whom  \add God has changed\add* inwardly are  \add true\add* Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*. And  \add God has accepted us because we have allowed God's\add* Spirit to change our hearts, not because we perform rituals. Even if  \add other\add* people will not praise us, God will praise us.

<usfm>
\v 28 It is not those who perform rituals for God who are true Jews, and it is not being circumcised in their bodies that causes God to accept them.
\v 29 On the contrary, we whom God has changed inwardly are the true Jews. God has accepted us and God's Spirit has changed our nature, not because we perform the rituals commanded by the law. Even if other people will not praise us, God will praise us.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 For he is not a Jew who is merely one outwardly; neither is circumcision that which is merely outward in the flesh. 
\v 29 But he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter. The praise of such a person comes not from people but from God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **outwardly** - This refers to Jewish rituals, such as circumcision, which people can see.
  * **merely outward in the flesh** - This refers to the physical change to a man's body when someone circumcises him.
  * **flesh** - This is a synecdoche for the whole body. AT: "body" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) 
  * **he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart** - These two phrases have similar meanings. The first phrase, "he is a Jew who is one inwardly," explains the second phrase, "circumcision is that of the heart." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **inwardly** - This refers to the values and motivations of the person whom God has transformed.
  * **of the heart** - Here "heart" is a metonym for the inner person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **in the Spirit, not in the letter** - Here "letter" is a synecdoche that refers to written Scripture. AT: "through the work of the Holy Spirit, not because you know the Scriptures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **in the Spirit** - This refers to the internal, spiritual part of a person that "God's Spirit" changes (UDB).
