===== translationNotes: =====


  * **The sons of Noah were Shem, Ham, and Japheth** - Some versions, including the ULB and UDB, include "The sons of" in order to make it clear that Shem, Ham, and Japheth were brothers to each other and sons of Noah. Otherwise, the reader would assume that each person represented one generation farther away from Noah, their ancestor. 
  * **Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared ... Methuselah** - These names are a list of ancestors. If your language has a specific way to mark this kind of list, you can use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
