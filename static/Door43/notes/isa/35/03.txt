===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah is speaking to the people of Judah.

  * **Strengthen the weak hands, and steady the knees that shake.** - This represents a person who is fearful and despondent. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense of God** - This can be reworded so that the abstract nouns "vengeance" and "recompense" are expressed as the verb "punish." The words "vengeance" and "recompense" mean the same thing and emphasize that God will punish Judah's enemies. AT: "your God will punish your enemies for what they have done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
