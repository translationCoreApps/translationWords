  * [[:en:obe:other:peace]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the city** - This refers to Jerusalem.
  * **he wept over it** - The word "it" refers to the city of Jerusalem, but it represents the people who lived in that city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **If only you had known ... bring you peace** - Jesus expressed his sadness that the people of Jerusalem had missed the opportunity to be at peace with God.
  * **you** - The word "you" is singular because Jesus was speaking to the city. But if this would be unnatural in your language, you could use a plural form of "you" to refer to the people of the city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **they are hidden from your eyes** - "your eyes" refer to the ability to see. This can be stated in active form. AT: "you can no longer see them" or "you are unable to know it" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
