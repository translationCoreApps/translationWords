\v 4 Joash said to the priests, "All the money that is brought in as sacred offerings into the house of Yahweh, that money for which each person is assessed—whether it is the money collected in the census, or the money received from personal vows, or the money brought in by people motivated by Yahweh in their hearts to give—
\v 5 the priests should receive the money from one of their treasurers and repair whatever damage is found in the temple."
