====== Acts 18 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "(Apollos) knew only the baptism of John" ==
Even after the death of Jesus, there remained some Jews who followed the teachings of John the Baptist, but who had not yet heard about Jesus. Apollos belongs to this group who was faithful to God through following John the Baptist, but who awaited the Messiah whom they did not know had come. The baptism to which this passage refers is John's baptism of repentance. It is distinct from christian baptism. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:faithful|Faithful]], [[:en:obe:kt:christ|messiah]] and [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]])
