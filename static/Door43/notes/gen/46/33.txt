====== Genesis 46:33-34 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 33 When the king summons you and asks, 'What work do you do?'
\v 34 answer by saying, 'From the time when we were young, we have taken care of livestock, just as our ancestors did.' If you tell him that, he will let you live in the Goshen region." Joseph told them to say that because the people of Egypt despised shepherds who came from other countries.

\v 33 It will come about, when Pharaoh calls you and asks, 'What is your occupation?'
\v 34 that you should say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth until now, both we, and our forefathers.' Do this so that you may live in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians."
