====== 1 Timothy 01:15-17 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 \add Something that all we believers\add* say is certainly true and is worthy for us to fully accept is that Christ Jesus came into the world in order to save sinful people \add so that God would not punish them for their sins\add*. As for me, I \add consider that I have sinned\add* more than all others.
\v 16 Yet Christ Jesus acted mercifully to me in order that he might demonstrate \add to people that he is perfectly patient with them\add*. He did that by his being patient with me, one who has sinned worse than all the others. He wanted what he did for me to be an example\f + \ft Or: to demonstrate his patience \f* to people who would \add later\add* believe in him and as a result would live forever.
\p
\v 17 I desire that people will honor and praise the only \add true\add* God forever! Even though no one can see him, he is the King who rules for all time, who will never die! Amen!\f + \ft Or: That is true! \f*

\v 15 Everyone should accept this fact, because we can count on it completely: Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. It is true that I am the worst sinner of all.
\v 16 But because I am the worst sinner, God had mercy on me before many others, so that they would see how patient he is. God is patiently waiting to give everlasting life to those people who will believe in him.
\p
\v 17 The eternal king cannot be seen, and he cannot die. He alone is God. It is he whom everyone will honor and praise forever and ever. Amen.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 This message is reliable and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. I am the worst of these.
\v 16 But for this reason I was given mercy, so that in me, the foremost, Christ Jesus might demonstrate all patience. He did this as an example for those who would trust in him for eternal life.
\v 17 Now to the king of the ages, the immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
