\v 28 Then the soldiers led Jesus from Caiaphas' house to the headquarters of Pilate, the Roman governor. It was early morning. Pilate was not a Jew, so Jesus' accusers thought that if they entered his headquarters, they would defile themselves and be unable to celebrate the Passover Festival. So they did not go in.
\v 29 So Pilate came out to talk to them. He said, "Of what are you accusing this man?"
\v 30 "If this man were not a criminal, we would not have brought him to you!" they replied.

\v 28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the governor. It was early in the morning, and they did not enter the palace of the governor so that they would not be defiled but would eat the Passover.
\v 29 So Pilate went out to them and said, "What accusation are you bringing against this man?"
\v 30 They answered and said to him, "If this man was not an evil doer, we would not have given him over to you."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here the storyline shifts back to Jesus. The soldiers and Jesus' accusers bring him to Caiaphas. Verse 28 gives us background information about why they did not enter the Praetorium. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

  * **Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas** - Here it is implied that they are leading Jesus from Caiaphas' house. AT: "Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas' house" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **they did not enter the palace of the governor so that they would not be defiled** - Since Pilate was not a Jew, the Jewish leaders could not enter his headquarters without becoming defiled. This would have prevented them from celebrating the Passover. You can translate the double negative in a positive form. AT: "they themselves remained outside Pilate's headquarters because Pilate was a Gentile. They did not want to become defiled" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]]) 
  * **If this man was not an evil doer, we would not have given him over to you** - You can translate this double negative in a positive form. AT: "This man is an evil doer, and we had to bring him to you for punishment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **given him over** - This phrase here means to hand over to an enemy.
