<usfm>
\v 12 Continually speak and act \add toward others\add* as people should who will be judged \f + \ft Or:whom \add God\add* will judge \f* by the law that frees us \add from being punished\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God punishing us\add* \f* \add for our sins\add*.
\v 13 \add Speak and act like that\add*, because when \add God\add* judges us, he will not act mercifully toward those who do not act mercifully toward others. But when we \add are\add* merciful \add to others, we can rejoice\add*, because \add our being\add* merciful \add shows\add* that \add we are acting like people whom God\add* has mercifully saved from being judged \f + \ft Or: \add we can rejoice\add* because \add God\add* will judge us mercifully \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Always speak and act toward others as people should whom God will judge using the law that frees us from being punished for our sins.
\v 13 Because when God judges us, he will not act mercifully toward those who do not act mercifully toward others. But if we are merciful to others, then we will not fear God when he judges us.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 So speak and act as those who will be judged by means of the law of freedom.
\v 13 For judgment comes without mercy to those who have shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
