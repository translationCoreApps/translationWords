  * **in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month** - "in the 2nd month, on the 20th day of the month." This is the second month of the Hebrew calendar. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **the cloud was lifted** - This can be stated in active form.  AT: "the cloud rose up" (UDB) or "Yahweh lifted the cloud" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the tabernacle of the covenant decrees** - The tabernacle was also called by this longer name because the ark with the law of God was placed inside it. Translate this the same way as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:num:01:50|1:50]].
