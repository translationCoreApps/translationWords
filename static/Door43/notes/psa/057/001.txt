===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **For the chief musician** - "This is for the director of music to use in worship"
  * **set to Al Tashheth** - This probably tells what musical style or tune to use when singing the psalm.  AT: "sing this psalm using the tune of 'Al Tashheth'" or "sing this using the Al Tashheth style"
  * **Al Tashheth** - This means "Do Not Destroy." Translators may either write the meaning or copy the Hebrew words. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  * **A psalm of David** - Possible meanings are 1) David wrote the psalm or 2) the psalm is about David or 3) the psalm is in the style of David's psalms.
  * **A michtam** - The meaning of the word "michtam" is uncertain. You may use the word "psalm" instead. This can be written as: "This is a psalm that David wrote." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:016:001|16:1]]. 
  * **when he fled from Saul, in the cave** - The purpose of this phrase can be stated clearly along with some basic details about the situation. AT: "This is about when David hid in the cave from Saul" or "This is about when King Saul was chasing David, and David hid in a cave" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **I take refuge in you** - Going to Yahweh for protection is spoken of as taking refuge in him. AT: "I go to you for protection" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I stay under your wings for protection** - The psalmist speaks of God as if he were a mother bird that protects its babies by huddling them under its wings. AT: "I trust you to protect me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **until this destruction is over** - The psalmist speaks of Saul's desire to kill him as if Saul sought to destroy an  enemy. AT: "until this trouble is finished" or "until I am no longer in danger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
