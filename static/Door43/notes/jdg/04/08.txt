\v 8 Barak replied, "I will go only if you go with me. If you will not go with me, I will not go."
\p
\v 9 She replied, "Indeed I will go with you. But because that is what you have decided to do, Yahweh will enable a woman to defeat Sisera, and the result will be that no one will honor you for doing that." So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh.

\v 8 Barak said to her, "If you go with me, I will go, but if you do not go with me, I will not go."
\v 9 She said, "I will certainly go with you. However, the road on which you are going will not lead to your honor, for Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman." Then Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh.
