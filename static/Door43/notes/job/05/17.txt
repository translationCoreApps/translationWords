===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer continues to use parallelism in verses 18 and 19, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize God's acts of chastening and healing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 

  * **God corrects ... chastening of the Almighty** - God is pictured as a parent correcting or instructing a child.
  * **blessed** - "favored"
  * **do not despise** - "do not reject" or "do not consider worthless"
  * **chastening** - "instruction" or "correction" or "discipline" (UDB)
  * **For he wounds and then binds up; he wounds and then his hands heal** - "For he wounds but binds up; he crushes but his hands heal" 
  * **his hands heal** - Here "his hands" represents God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **He will rescue you out of six troubles; indeed, in seven troubles, no evil will touch you** - The use of increasing numbers such as "six" and "seven" represents the idea of many, many times. AT: "He will rescue you out of trouble over and over again; indeed, time after time, no evil will touch you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
