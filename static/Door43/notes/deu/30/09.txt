===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **the work of your hand** - Here "hand" refers to the whole person. AT: "in all the work you do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **in the fruit of your body ... in the fruit of your cattle ... in the fruit of your ground** - These three phrases are idioms for "in children ... in calves ... in crops." Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:28:03|28:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **that are written** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that I have written" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **with all your heart and all your soul** - The idiom "with all ... heart" means "completely" and "with all ... soul" means "with all your being." These two phrases have similar meaning. AT: "with all your being" or "with all your energy." Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:04:29|4:29]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
