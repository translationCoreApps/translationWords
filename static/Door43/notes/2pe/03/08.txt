\v 8 Dear friends, I want you to understand well that the Lord \add God is willing to wait a long time to judge the people in the world! How much time passes before\add* the Lord God \add judges the people in the world does not matter to him! He considers\add* that one day \add passes no more quickly than\add* a thousand years, and \add he also considers\add* that a thousand years \add pass as quickly as\add* one day passes \add to us!\add*
\v 9 \add Therefore, you should not think that because Christ has not yet come back to judge people\add*, the Lord God is delaying\f + \ft Or: slow to do \f* what he promised. Some people think that this is so, \add and they say that Christ never will come back\add*. But \add you should understand that the reason why Christ has not yet come back to judge people is that\add* God is being patient towards you, because he does not want anyone to be lost \add eternally\add*. Instead, he wants everyone to turn away from their sinful behavior.

\v 8 It should not escape your notice, beloved, that one day with the Lord is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day.
\v 9 The Lord does not move slowly concerning his promises, as some consider slowness to be. Instead, he is patient toward you. He does not desire for any of you to perish, but for everyone to make room for repentance.
