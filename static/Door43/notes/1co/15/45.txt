====== 1 Corinthians 15:45-46 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 45 \add In the Scriptures\add* it is written \f + \ft Or:we read \f* that \add when\add* the first man, Adam, \add was created\add*, he became a living human being. \add Christ later also became a human being\add*. But\add he is different from Adam, because he\add* became a person who gives us \add spiritual\add* life.
\v 46 But our bodies that God's Spirit will completely control\f + \ft Or: will give us \f* are not the first bodies that we have. We have our natural bodies first.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 45 So the scriptures say, "The first man, Adam, was a living being who gave his children and descendants life." But Christ, the second Adam, gave people God's power to live forever.
\v 46 What belongs to the earth came first, the natural, and then came what belongs to God, that is the spiritual.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 45 So also it is written, "The first man Adam became a living soul." The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
\v 46 But the spiritual did not come first but the natural, and then the spiritual.
