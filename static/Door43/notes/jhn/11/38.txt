\v 38 Jesus was physically shaken and emotionally upset when he came to the tomb. It was a cave, and the entrance had been covered by a large stone.
\v 39 Jesus gave a command to those standing there, "Take away the stone." However, Martha objected, "Lord, by this time there will be a putrid odor, for he has been dead for four days."
\v 40 Jesus said to her, "Did I not tell you the truth when I told you that if you trusted me, you would see who God is and you would know what God can do?"

\v 38 Then Jesus again, being deeply moved in himself, went to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
\v 39 Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of Lazarus, the one who had died, said to Jesus, "Lord, by this time the body will be decaying, for he has been dead for four days."
\v 40 Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you that, if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it** - John pauses the story briefly to describe the tomb where the people had buried Lazarus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **Martha, the sister of Lazarus** - Martha and Mary were older sisters of Lazarus. AT: "Martha, the older sister of Lazarus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **by this time the body will be decaying** - "by this time there will be a bad smell" or "the body is already stinking" 
  * **Did I not say to you that, if you believed, you would see the glory of God?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis to the point that God is about to do something wonderful. AT: "I told you that if you trusted me, you would see what God can do!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
