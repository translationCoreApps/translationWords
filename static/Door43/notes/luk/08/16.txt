\v 16 "After people light a lamp, they do not cover it with a basket or put it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a lampstand, so that those who enter \add the house\add* can see \add things from\add* its light \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, you must tell God's truth to others so that they can know what I can do for them\add*.
\v 17 \add God wants to\add* make clear all \add of his truth\add* that was not evident previously. \add He intends\add* that all of\add the truth\add* that \add he\add* had not revealed before be told openly \f + \ft Or:that \add his people\add* openly tell \add others\add* all \add of the truth\add* that \add he\add* has not revealed before \f*.
\v 18 So listen carefully \add to what I tell you\add*, because \add God\add* will enable those who accept \add my truth\add* to \add understand even\add* more. But \add God\add* will cause those who do not accept \add my truth\add* to not understand even \add the little\add* that they think they have \add understood\add*."

\v 16 After lighting a lamp, people do not cover it with a basket or put it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a lampstand, so that everyone who enters the room can see by its light.
\v 17 This illustrates that everything that is hidden now will someday be made visible. And everything that is secret now will someday be brought out into the open.
\v 18 So make sure that you are listening carefully to what I tell you, because God will enable those who believe his truth to understand even more. But God will cause those who do not believe his truth to not understand even the little that they think they have understood."

\v 16 Now, no one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a bowl or puts it under a bed. Rather, he puts it on a lampstand, so that everyone who enters may see the light.
\v 17 For nothing is hidden that will not be made known, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come into the light.
\v 18 So listen carefully, for to the one who has, more will be given to him, but the one who does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him."
