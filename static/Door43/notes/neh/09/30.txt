\v 30 You were patient with them for many years. You warned them by the messages your Spirit gave to the prophets. But they did not listen to those messages. So again you allowed the armies of the nations nearby to defeat them.
\v 31 But because you act mercifully, you did not destroy them completely or abandon them. You are a gracious and merciful God!

\v 30 For many years you put up with them and warned them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet they did not listen. So you gave them into the hand of the neighboring peoples.
