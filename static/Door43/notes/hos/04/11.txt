\q

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh is talking about Israel.

  * **sexual promiscuity, wine, and new wine, which have taken away their understanding** - The people of Israel are pursuing sex outside of marriage and drinking too much wine. In doing these activities they have forgotten Yahweh's commands. These actions are spoken of here as if they were someone who could prevent other people from understanding the importance of obeying Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **their walking sticks give them prophecies** - Idol worshipers used walking sticks to help them predict the future. The walking sticks are spoken of here as if they were people who spoke prophecies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **a mind of promiscuity has misled them** - Worshiping the idols and sleeping with the temple prostitutes has developed in the people of Israel the desire to always sin against Yahweh in these ways. Here "mind" is spoken of as if it were a separate person who was able to convince the people to disobey Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **has misled** - has convinced the people to sin (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
