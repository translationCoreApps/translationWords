\v 9 If anyone dies very suddenly when he is near you, then your hair that you have dedicated to me is no longer sacred. So you must wait seven days and then shave it all off. Then you must perform a special ritual to cause yourself to become acceptable to me again.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **defiles his consecrated head** - Here "head" represents the Nazirite man's hair, which symbolizes his vow. AT: "defiles his long hair which shows everyone he is separated to God" or "he becomes defiled" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **on the day of his purification** - The abstract noun "purification" can be stated as the verbal phrase. AT: "on the day when he makes himself acceptable to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the seventh day** - "the 7th day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
