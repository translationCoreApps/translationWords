  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **I, even I** - "I, I myself" or "I, I alone." Yahweh repeats "I" to emphasize that only he is God. 
  * **I lift up my hand to heaven and say** - "I lift up my hand to heaven and swear" or "I have taken an oath." Lifting up the hand is a sign of making an oath.
  * **As I live forever** - "As certainly as I live forever" or "I swear by my life which is never-ending." This statement assures the people that what God says in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:32:41|32:41]]-[[:en:bible:notes:deu:32:42|32:42]] will happen.
