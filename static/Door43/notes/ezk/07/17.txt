====== Ezekiel 07:17-19 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 \add Because they will be very afraid\add*, all the people's hands will become limp and their knees will become very weak.
\v 18 They will put on clothes made from rough cloth, and they will be terrified. Their faces will show that they are ashamed, and they will shave their heads \add to show that they are very sad\add*.
\v 19 They will throw their silver into the streets, and consider that their gold is only like \f + \ft simile \f* garbage, because they will realize that their silver and gold will not be able to rescue them when I, Yahweh, punish them. They will not be able to use their gold and silver to buy things to fill their stomachs, because having a lot of gold and silver has led them to sin.

\v 17 Because they will be very afraid, all the people's hands will become limp and weak, and their knees will become very weak and unable to hold them up.
\v 18 They will put on clothes made from rough cloth, and they will be terrified. Their faces will show that they are ashamed, and they will shave their heads to show that they are very sad.
\v 19 They will throw their silver into the streets, and consider their gold the same way they would consider garbage, because they will realize that their silver and gold will not be able to rescue them when Yahweh punishes them. They will not be able to buy food to fill their stomachs, because having a lot of gold and silver has led them to sin.

\q
\v 17 Every hand will falter and every knee will be weak as water,
\q
\v 18 and they will wear sackcloth, and terror will cover them;
\q and shame will be on every face, and baldness on all of their heads.
\q
\v 19 They will throw their silver into the streets and their gold will be like refuse. Their silver and their gold
\q will not be able to rescue them in the day of Yahweh's rage. Their lives will not be saved,
\q and their hunger will not be satisfied, because their iniquity has become a stumbling block.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These are Yahweh's words about Israel.

  * **Every hand will falter and every knee will be weak as water** - The hands and knees are synecdoches for the people themselves, AT: "They will all be terrified" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Every hand will falter** - "Everyone will be so terrified that they will be unable to work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **falter** - fail to do what it is supposed to do
  * **every knee will be weak as water** - "everyone will be so terrified that they will not be able to stand." This is an exaggeration. Another possible translation is, "every knee will flow with water," a euphemism for all the people losing control of their bladders because they are so frightened. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **knee ... weak as water** - Water cannot stand up, and the people's knees will be so weak that the people are unable to stand on their legs. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **and terror will cover them** - Terror is spoken of as if it were clothing. AT: "everyone will see how terrified they are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **baldness on all of their heads** - Shaving the head was a sign of sadness. AT: "all of them will shave their heads" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **in the day of Yahweh's rage** - "in the day when Yahweh acts on his anger" or "when Yahweh punishes them" 
  * **the day** - This can be a time period of more or less than one 24-hour day.
  * **their hunger will not be satisfied** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "they will not be able to satisfy their hunger" or "they will still be hungry even after they eat all they have" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **their iniquity has become a stumbling block** - Possible meanings are 1) "because having a lot of gold and silver has led them to sin" (UDB) or 2) "because they are evil, they are committing sins that show how evil they are."
