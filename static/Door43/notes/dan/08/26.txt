===== translationNotes: =====

  * **seal up the vision** - The angel speaks about the vision as if it were a scroll that could be closed with a wax seal. This prevented anyone from seeing the contents until the seal was broken. AT: "close and seal up what you have written about the vision" or "do not tell anyone about the vision now" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
