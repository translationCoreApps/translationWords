\v 1 Abraham is the revered ancestor of us Jews. So think about what we can learn from what happened to Abraham.
\v 2 If it was because of Abraham's doing good things that God put him right with himself, Abraham would then have had reason to boast about that to people, (but, even so, he would not have had any reason to boast to God about it).
\v 3 Remember that in the scriptures it is written that Abraham believed what God promised to do for him, and that for this reason, God considered Abraham to be right with himself.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, found?
\v 2 For if Abraham had been justified by works, he would have had a reason to boast, but not before God.
\v 3 For what does the scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness."

  * **For what does the scripture say** - Paul uses this question to add emphasis. He speaks of the Scriptures as if they were alive and could talk. AT: "For we can read in the scripture" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **and it was counted to him as righteousness** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "and God considered Abraham as a righteous person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
