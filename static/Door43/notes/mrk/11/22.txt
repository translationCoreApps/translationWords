===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Jesus answered them** - "Jesus replied to his disciples"
  * **Truly I say to you** - "I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **whoever says** - "if anyone says"
  * **if he does not doubt in his heart but believes** - Here "not doubt" is a double negative meaning "truly believe." Jesus says it both ways for emphasis. AT: "if he truly believes in his heart" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **God will do** - "God will make happen"
