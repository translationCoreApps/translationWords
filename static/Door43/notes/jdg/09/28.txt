===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Gaal ... Ebed** - Translate these names as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:09:26|9:26]].
  * **Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him?** - Gaal uses a question to emphasize that the people of Shechem should not serve Abimelech. AT: "We should not serve Abimelech!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him?** - Both of these questions means the same thing. Gaal refers to Abimelech as "Shechem" because Abimelech's mother was from Shechem. AT: "We should not serve Abimelech, that is, Shechem!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Is he not the son of Jerub Baal? Is  Zebul not his officer?** - Gaal uses a question to emphasize that the people of Shechem should not serve Abimelech. AT: "He is just the son of Jerub Baal, and Zebul is just his officer." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Jerub Baal** - This is another name for Gideon. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:06:31|6:32]].
  * **Zebul** - This is the name of a man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Serve the men of Hamor, Shechem's father** - Gaal means the people of Shechem should serve those who descended from Hamor, that is, those who are truly Canaanites, and not serve someone whose father was an Israelite.
  * **Why should we serve Abimelech?** - Gaal uses a question to emphasize that the people of Shechem should not serve Abimelech. AT: "We should not serve Abimelech!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
