\v 5 When  \add the one who is like a\add* lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living  \add creature\add* say, "Come!" This time, I saw a black horse  \add come out\add*. The one who sat on it had a pair of balance scales in his hand.
\v 6 I heard a voice  \add that sounded\add* like  \add it was coming from\add* among the four living  \add creatures\add*. It was saying \add to the horseman\f + \ft Or: to the man who was sitting on the horse\add* \f*, "A quart of wheat  \add will cost so much that\add* a man must work a whole day to earn enough money to buy it, and three quarts of barley will sell for the same price. But do not cut off  \add the supply of\add* olive oil or the wine \f + \ft metonymy \f*!"

\v 5 Then the Lamb opened the third seal, and I heard the third living creature say, "Come!" This time, I saw a black horse appear. There was someone riding it, and he had a pair of balance scales in his hand.
\v 6 Then I heard a voice that sounded like it was coming from among the four living creatures. It said to the person on the horse, "Make it happen that one liter of wheat will cost so much that a man must work a whole day to earn enough money to buy it. Also make it happen that three liters of barley will sell for the same price. But do not reduce the supply of olive oil or wine."

\v 6 I heard what seemed to be a voice among the four living creatures say, "A choenix of wheat for one denarius, and three choenices of barley for a denarius. But do not harm the oil and the wine."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the third seal** - "the next seal" or "seal number three" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **the third living creature** - "the next living creature" or "living creature number three" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **a pair of scales** - a tool used for weighing things
  * **A choenix of wheat for one denarius** - Some languages might want a verb such as "cost" or "buy" in the sentence. AT: "A choenix of wheat now costs one denarius" or "Buy a choenix of wheat with one denarius" There was very little wheat for all the people, so its price was very high.
  * **A choenix of wheat** - This refers to a specific measure that was about one liter. AT: "one liter" or "one bowl" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bvolume]])
  * **one denarius** - This coin was worth a day's wages. AT: "one silver coin" or "the pay for one day of work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]])
  * **But do not harm the oil and the wine** - If the oil and wine were harmed, there would be less of them for people to buy, and their prices would go up.
  * **the oil and the wine** - These expressions probably stand for the olive oil harvest and the grape harvest. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
