\v 4 Others said, "We have needed to borrow money to pay the taxes we owe the king for our fields and our vineyards.
\v 5 We are Jews just like the other Jews. Our children are just as important to us as their children are to them. But we have been forced to sell our children to become slaves in order to pay what we owe. We have already sold some of our daughters to become slaves. Our fields and vineyards have been taken away from us, so now we do not have the money to pay what we owe."

\v 4 Some also said, "We have borrowed money to pay the king's tax on our fields and our vineyards.
\v 5 Yet now our flesh and blood is the same as our brothers, and our children are the same as their children. We are forced to sell our sons and our daughters to become slaves. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved. But it is not in our power to help it because other men now own our fields and our vineyards."
