\v 8 For those reasons, I beg you to  \add forgive him and accept him into your group again, and thus\add* assure him that you truly love him.
\v 9  \add I feel sure that you will do as I ask\add*, because when I wrote  \add severely\add* to you  \add before\add*, I did it to test you by seeing whether or not you really would do everything  \add that I, as your apostle, asked you to do\add*.

<usfm>
\v 8 So I encourage you to publicly affirm your love for him.
