  * **for which they act as prostitutes** - The people being unfaithful to Yahweh by worshiping false gods is spoken of as if they were acting like a man who betrays his wife by committing adultery. AT: "for which they are unfaithful to Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a permanent statute for them throughout their people's generations** - Translate this phrase in the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:03:15|3:17]].
