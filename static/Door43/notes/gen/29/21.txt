===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Give me my wife, for my days have been completed—so that I may marry her!** - Here "days" stands for a longer period of time. The phrase "have been completed" can be stated in active form. The statement is emphatic. AT: "Give me Rachel so that I may marry her, for I have worked seven years for you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **made a feast** - "prepared a wedding feast." Most likely Laban had others prepare the feast. AT: "had others prepare a wedding feast" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
