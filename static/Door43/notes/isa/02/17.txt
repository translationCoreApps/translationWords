===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah speaks to the people of Judah in the form of a poem. He continues to describe what will happen on the day of Yahweh of Hosts ([[:en:bible:notes:isa:02:12|2:12]]). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **The pride of man will be brought low** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "He will bring low every proud man" or "He will humiliate every proud man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the haughtiness of men will fall** - The abstract noun "haughtiness" can be translated as an adjective. AT: "those people who are haughty will stop being haughty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Yahweh alone will be exalted** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "people will praise only Yahweh." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:02:09|2:11]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **The idols will completely pass away** - "All idols will disappear" (UDB) or "There will be no more idols"

  * **from the terror of Yahweh** - because they are very afraid of Yahweh
