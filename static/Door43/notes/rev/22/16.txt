  * [[:en:obe:kt:testimony]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:church]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:descendant]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:david]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to testify to you** - Here the word "you" is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **the root and the descendant of David** - The words "root" and "descendant" mean basically the same thing. Jesus speaks of being a "descendant" as if he were a "root" that grew out of David. Together the words emphasize that Jesus belongs to the family of David. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]).
  * **the bright morning star** - Jesus speaks of himself as if he were the bright star that appears early in the morning and indicates that a new day is about to begin. See how you translated "morning star" in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:02:26|2:28]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
