<usfm>
\v 18 I have plenty of things now. I have so many things that you sent me through Epaphroditus. These things are like when priests burn an animal sacrifice to God and it smells good to him.
\v 19 God, whom I serve, will supply everything you need because you belong to Jesus Christ, who owns the splendor and wealth of heaven.
\v 20 So people should praise God our Father, who will rule forever and ever in brilliant light! Amen!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 I have received all the things, and I have plenty. I have been filled. I have received from Epaphroditus the things from you. They are a sweet-smelling aroma, an acceptable sacrifice pleasing to God.
\v 19 My God will fill every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
\v 20 Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I have received all the things** - Possible meanings are 1) Paul has received everything that the Philippians sent or 2) Paul is using humor to continue the business metaphor from [[:en:bible:notes:php:03:08|3:8]] and saying that this part of the letter is a receipt for commercial goods that Epaphroditus delivered.
  * **I have plenty** - Paul means plenty of the things that he needs for himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **They are a sweet-smelling aroma, an acceptable sacrifice pleasing to God** - Paul speaks of the gift from the Philippian church as if it were a sacrifice offered to God on an altar. Paul implies that the church's gift is very pleasing to God, like the sacrifices that the priests burned, which had a smell that pleased God. AT: "I assure you these gifts are very pleasing to God, like an acceptable sacrifice" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will fill every need of yours** - This is the same word translated "have been filled" in verse 18. It is an idiom meaning "will provide everything you need" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus** - "from his glorious riches that he gives through Christ Jesus"
  * **Now to our God** - The word "Now" marks the closing prayer and the end of this section of the letter.
