===== translationNotes: =====

  * **When he sits on the throne of his kingdom** - Here "throne" represents the person's power and authority as king. To sit on the throne means to become king. AT: "When he becomes king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **from the law that is before the priests, who are Levites** - "from the copy of the law that the Levitical priests keep"
  * **so as to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to observe them** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the king must obey all of God's law. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
