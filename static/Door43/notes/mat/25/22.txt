===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues telling the parable about the servants and the talents. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]])

  * **I have made two more talents** - "I have earned two more talents" 
  * **Well done** - "You have done well" or "You have done right." Your culture might have an expression that a master (or someone in authority) would use to show that he approves of what his servant (or someone under him) has done. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:25:19|25:21]].
  * **Enter into the joy of your master** - The phrase "Enter into the joy" is an idiom. Also, the master is speaking about himself in the third person. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:25:19|25:21]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
