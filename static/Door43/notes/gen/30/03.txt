===== translationNotes: =====

  * **She said** - "Rachel said"
  * **See** - "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you." This adds emphasis to what Rachel says next. 
  * **there is my servant Bilhah ... I will have children by her** - At that time, this was an acceptable way for a barren woman to have children that would legally belong to her. The full meaning of this may be made explicit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Bilhah** - This is the name of Rachel's female servant. See how you translated this name in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:29:28|29:29]].
  * **on my knees** - This is a way of saying that the child that Bilhah gives birth to will belong to Rachel. AT: "for me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I will have children by her** - "and in this way she will cause me to have children"
