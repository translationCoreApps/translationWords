\v 13 As for me, if I did that, I would not be able to \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* endure being disgraced by having done that. And as for you, everyone in Israel would condemn you for having done such a disgraceful deed. So I plead with you, talk to the king. I am sure that he will allow me to marry you."
\v 14 But he would not heed her. He was stronger than she was, so he forced her to have sex with him.

\v 13 How could I be rid of my shame? What about you? You would be like one of the fools in Israel! Now, please speak to the king, for he would not keep me from you."
\v 14 However Amnon would not listen to her. Since he was stronger than Tamar, he seized her and he slept with her.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Tamar continues to talk to Amnon.

  * **How could I be rid of my shame?** - Tamar asks this rhetorical question to emphasize how much shame she would have if she slept with him. Tamar speaks of getting rid of her shame as if it were an enemy or a tormentor that she needed to escape from. AT: "If you do this, I would have to endure shame everywhere I go" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
