===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This too comes ... excellent in wisdom** - This concludes the parable started in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:28:23|28:23]]. The implied lesson of the parable is that farmers are wise enough to listen to Yahweh's instructions about planting and threshing. But the leaders of Jerusalem are foolish for not listening to Yahweh's instructions that he is speaking through Isaiah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Yahweh of hosts** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].
