<usfm>
\v 10 When you tell these things to the people, they will ask, 'Why has Yahweh declared that these terrible things will happen to us? What have we done \add for which we deserve to be punished like this\add*? What sin have we committed against Yahweh our God?'
\p
\v 11 Then this is what you must tell them that I am replying to them: 'It is because your ancestors turned away from me, Yahweh. They worshiped other gods and served them. They abandoned me and did not obey my commands.

\v 10 Then it will happen that you will report all these words to this people, and they will say to you, 'Why has Yahweh decreed all this great disaster against us? What is our iniquity and sin that we sinned against Yahweh our God?'
\v 11 So say to them, 'Because your ancestors abandoned me—this is Yahweh's declaration—and they went after other gods and worshiped and bowed down to them. They abandoned me and have not kept my law.
