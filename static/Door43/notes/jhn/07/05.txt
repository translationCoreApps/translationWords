\v 6 So Jesus said to them, "It is not yet time for me to bring my work to an end. However, you can choose any time you want to accomplish whatever you wish.
\v 7 The people who live for themselves and love the things of this world cannot hate you, but they do hate me. I am the one who tells them that what they do with their lives is evil.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For even his brothers did not believe in him** - This sentence is a break from the main storyline as John tells us some background information about the brothers of Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **his brothers** - "his younger brothers"
  * **My time has not yet come** - The word "time" is a metonym. Jesus is implying that it is not the right time for him to bring his ministry to a close. AT: "It is not the right time for me to end my work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **your time is always ready** - "any time is good for you"
  * **The world cannot hate you** - Here the "world" is a metonym for the people who live in the world. AT: "All the people in the world cannot hate you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I testify about it that its works are evil** - "I tell them that what they are doing is evil"
