===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Asaph is speaking on behalf of the people of Israel. He begins in verse 8 to speak of the way God settled Israel in their land as if God were a man clearing ground to plant a grapevine. If you need to translate the meaning of the story rather than the story itself, see how the UDB translates it.

  * **make your face shine on us** - The writer speaks of Yahweh acting favorably towards them as if Yahweh's face shone a light on them. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:080:001|80:3]]. AT: "act favorably towards us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **we will be saved** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "you will save us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **You brought a vine out of Egypt** - Asaph compares the nation of Israel to a vine made ready to transplant. AT: "You brought us, like a vine, out of Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **you drove out nations and transplanted it** - The psalmist speaks of his people as if they were a plant that Yahweh was transplanting. AT: "you drove out nations from their land and gave it to us, the vine, and planted us there" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
