===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Joseph was brought down to Egypt** - Travelling to Egypt is always considered as going "down" in contrast to going "up" to the promised land. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The Ishmaelites had taken Joseph to Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Yahweh was with Joseph** - This means that Yahweh helped Joseph and was always with him. AT: "Yahweh guided Joseph and helped him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **He lived in the house** - Here the author speaks of working in the master's house as if it were living in the master's house. Only the most trusted servants were permitted to work in their master's house. AT : "he worked in the house" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **his Egyptian master** - Joseph was now Potiphar's slave.
