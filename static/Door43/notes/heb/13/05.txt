\v 5 Live without constantly wanting money, and be happy no matter how much or little you own. Remember what Moses wrote that God said:
\q "I will never leave you;
\q I will never stop providing for you."
\p
\v 6 So we can say confidently as the Psalmist said,
\q "Since the Lord is the one who helps me, I will not be afraid! People can do nothing to me that will keep God from helping me."

\v 5 Let your conduct be free from the love of money. Be content with the things you have, for God himself has said, "I will never leave you, nor will I forsake you."
\v 6 Let us be content so that we may have courage to say,
\q "The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.
\q What can a man do to me?"
