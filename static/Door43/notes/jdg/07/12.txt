<usfm>
\v 12 The Midianites, the Amalekites, and all the people of the east settled along in the valley, as thick as a cloud of locusts. Their camels were more than could be counted; they were more in number than the grains of the sand on the seashore.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **as thick as a cloud of locusts** - Here "cloud" means a swarm. The author speaks of the army as if it were a swarm of locusts to emphasize how many soldiers there were. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Their camels were more ... in number than the grains of the sand on the seashore** - The author uses a hyperbole, an exaggeration, to emphasize that there were very many camels. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Their camels were more than could be counted** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Their camels were more than anyone could count" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
