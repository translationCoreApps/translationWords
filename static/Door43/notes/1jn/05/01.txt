====== 1 John 05:1-3 ======

<usfm>
\v 1 All those who believe that Jesus is the Messiah\f + \ft Or: person God sent  \add to rescue us\add* \f* are ones who  \add have truly\add* become children of God. And everyone who loves  \add a man who is\add* someone's father will  \add be expected to\add* love that man's children as well. \add Similarly, those who love God, who has caused them to become his children\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add should love their fellow believers, whom God has also caused to become his children\add*.
\v 2 The way we can be sure that we  \add truly\add* love God's children is this: We are loving them when we love God and do what he commands  \add us to do\add*.
\v 3  \add I say this\add* because our obeying what God commands  \add us to do\add* is\add the same as\add* loving him. And it is not burdensome\f + \ft Or: difficult \f* for  \add us to do\add* what God commands  \add us to do\add*.

<usfm>
\v 1 All those who believe that Jesus is the Christ are children of God, born from God. And whoever loves anyone who is a father certainly loves his child also.
\v 2 The way we can be sure that we truly love God's children is when we love God and do what he commands us to do.
\v 3 I am saying this because what loving God really means is that we do what he commands. Also, it is not difficult to do what he commands.

\p
\v 1 Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born from God. And whoever loves a father also loves the child born from him.
\v 2 Because of this we know that we love God's children: when we love God and do his commandments.
\v 3 For this is love for God: that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.
