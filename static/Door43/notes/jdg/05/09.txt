===== translationNotes: =====


  * **My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel** - The word "heart" represents a person's emotions. The phrase "My heart goes out to" is a way of saying that Deborah feels gratitude or appreciation. AT: "I appreciate the commanders of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **you who ride on white donkeys ... you who walk along the road** - This contrast probably refers to rich people and poor people. AT: "you rich people who ride on white donkeys ... you poor people who walk along the road." The two opposite extremes are used together to mean everyone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **sitting on rugs for saddles** - These rugs were probably used as saddles on the donkey's back to make the rider more comfortable.
