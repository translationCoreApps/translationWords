===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **I will build you up again so you will be built** - Yahweh purposefully repeats the idea that he will build Israel to emphasize it. If your language can only use active verbs or has some other way to emphasize the idea, you may want to use it here. AT: "I will build you up again. Remember this: I will build you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **virgin Israel** - It was common to refer to nations as if they were women. However, "virgin" makes a person think about a young woman who has never married and so has never had the opportunity to be faithless to her husband. Therefore, calling Israel a virgin is an ironic use of language. Translate as in  [[:en:bible:notes:jer:18:13|18:13]]. AT: "Israel, who falsely pretends to be fully devoted to me" or "my faithless people Israel" (See: Personification and Irony)
  * **tambourines** - musical instruments with heads like a drum that can be hit and with pieces of metal around their sides that sound when the instruments are shaken (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
