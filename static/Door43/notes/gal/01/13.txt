====== Galatians 01:13-14 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 People have told you how I behaved formerly when \add I practiced\add* the Jewish religion. They told you that I continually did very harmful things to the groups of believers that God \add established\add*, and they told you that I tried to get rid of those people.
\v 14 I practiced the Jewish religion more thoroughly than many \add other Jews\add* who were my age practiced it. I much more enthusiastically tried to get others to obey the traditions that my ancestors \add kept\add*.

\v 13 People have told you about what I did in the past when I worshiped God in the Jewish way. I never stopped doing the worst things to the groups of believers that God had established. I tried to destroy those believers and their groups.
\v 14 I honored God in the Jewish way more thoroughly than any other Jew my own age. I was very angry when I saw other Jews neglecting to obey the traditions that our ancestors had kept.

<usfm>
\v 13 You have heard about my former life in Judaism, how I was persecuting the church of God beyond measure and that I was trying to destroy it.
\v 14 I advanced in Judaism beyond many of those who were my own age, from out of my own people. That is how extremely zealous I was for the traditions of my fathers.
