===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Jerusalem** - This refers to the "Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven" that he described in the previous verse and not to the physical Jerusalem.
  * **like a very precious jewel, like a stone of crystal-clear jasper** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the brilliance of Jerusalem by naming a specific jewel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **crystal-clear** - "extremely clear"
  * **jasper** - This is a valuable stone. Jasper may have been clear like glass or crystal. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:04:01|4:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **twelve gates** - "12 gates" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **were written** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "someone had written" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
