\v 47 Because you did not worship Yahweh your God with joyfulness and gladness of heart when you were in prosperity,
\v 48 therefore will you serve the enemies that Yahweh will send against you; you will serve them in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in poverty. He will put a yoke of iron on your neck until he destroys you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **joyfulness and gladness of heart** - Here "joyfulness" and "gladness of heart" mean the same thing. They emphasize that the people should have been very glad to worship Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **He will put a yoke of iron on your neck** - This is a metaphor for Yahweh allowing the enemy to treat the Israelites cruelly and make them slaves. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
