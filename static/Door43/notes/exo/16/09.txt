\v 11 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and said,
\v 12 "I have heard the complaints of the people of Israel. Speak to them and say, 'In the evening you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am Yahweh your God.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It came about** - This phrase is used here to mark an important event in the story. The important event here is the people seeing Yahweh's glory. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **behold** - The word "behold" here shows that the people saw something interesting.
  * **bread** - God speaks of the food that he will send as if it were bread. The Israelites would eat this food every day, just as they had eaten bread every day before this. See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:16:04|16:4]]. AT: "food" or "food like bread" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
