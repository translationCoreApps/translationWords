===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he ate and drank before him** - "Uriah ate and drank with David"
  * **down to his house** - Possible meanings of the word "down" are 1) Uriah's house was located at a lower elevation that the king's palace or 2)  Uriah's house was of lesser importance than the king's palace. See how you traslated the similar phrase "down to your house" in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:11:06|11:8]]. AT: "to his house" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
