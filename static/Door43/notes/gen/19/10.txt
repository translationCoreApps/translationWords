===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But the men** - "But Lot's two guests" or "But the two angels"
  * **the men reached out their hands and brought ... them and shut** - Your language may need to add that the men opened the door first. AT: 'the men opened the door far enough so they could reach out their hands and pull ... them, and then they shut" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Lot's visitors struck with blindness the men** - The phrase "struck with blindness" is a metaphor; the visitors did not physically hit the men. AT: "Lot's visitors blinded the men" or "they took away their sight" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **both young and old** - "men of all ages." This merism emphasizes that the visitors blinded all the men. This could indicate social standing rather than age. AT: "both small and great"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
