====== Hebrews 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is about how Jesus is the greatest high priest.

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 4:3-4, 7, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== God's rest ==
This is probably a reference to a prophesied time when Israel would have peace. This may be physical peace or spiritual peace. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]])
