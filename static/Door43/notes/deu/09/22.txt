\v 22 At Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah, you provoked Yahweh to wrath.
\v 23 When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea and said, 'Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you,' then you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you did not believe or listen to his voice.
\v 24 You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that I knew you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to remind the people of Israel about what happened in the past.

  * **Taberah ... Massah ... Kibroth Hattaavah** - These are names of places that the people of Israel went through while they were in the wilderness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Go up** - They were on low land, and the land Yahweh had told them to take was in the hills, so they had to go uphill to get to it.
  * **rebelled against the commandment** - The word "commandment" is a metonym for Yahweh himself. AT: "rebelled against Yahweh; you did not obey the commandment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **listen to his voice** - Here "his voice" means what God had said. AT: "obey what he said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **from the day that I knew you** - "from the time I began to lead you." Some translations read "from the day that he knew you," the day that Yahweh first knew them.
