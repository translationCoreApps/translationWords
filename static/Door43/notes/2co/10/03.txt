====== 2 Corinthians 10:3-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 \add Remember that\add* although I am \add human like everyone else\add* in the world, I do not fight \add against those who oppose me\add* in the way that people who are not believers fight those who oppose them.
\v 4 \add I will tell you what I mean by that: Just like soldiers use\add* various weapons \add to fight their enemies\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add I\add* \add fight against\f + \ft Or: oppose\add* \f* \add those who\add* oppose God's message, but I do it in a different way. I do not \add use human arguments and clever, Or: sweet talk\add*, like unbelievers do. Instead, \add I fight against my opponents\add* by the powerful means that God \add has given me\add*. With that power \add I destroy their arguments against God's message and against me, just like soldiers destroy\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the fortresses \add of their enemies\add*.

\v 3 For though we now are living in our physical bodies, we are fighting like armies fight.
\v 4 And we are fighting with weapons, but these weapons are not designed by human beings, but by God. These weapons are powerful, so powerful that they can tear apart any false arguments.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 For even though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh.
\v 4 For the weapons we fight with are not fleshly. Instead, they have divine power to destroy strongholds. They bring to nothing misleading arguments.
