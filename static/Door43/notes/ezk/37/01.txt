\c 37
\p
\v 1 The hand of Yahweh was upon me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of Yahweh and set me down in the midst of a valley; it was full of bones.
\v 2 Then he made me pass through them round and round. Behold! A great many of them were in the valley. Behold! They were very dry.
\v 3 He said to me, "Son of man, can these bones live again?" So I said, "Lord Yahweh, you alone know."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Ezekiel is speaking

  * **The hand of Yahweh was upon me** - The word "hand" is often used to refer to someone's power or action. A person with his hand on another person has power over that other person. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:01:01|1:3]]. AT: "Yahweh was controlling me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in the midst** - "in the middle"
  * **round and round** - "in every direction"
  * **Behold!** - The word "Behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
