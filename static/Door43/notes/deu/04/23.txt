===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Pay attention to yourselves** - "Pay careful attention"
  * **Yahweh your God has forbidden you ... Yahweh your God** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one person, so the words "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God** - Moses compares how Yahweh acts when he is angry to how a fire destroys things. AT: "Yahweh your God will severely punish and destroy you like a devouring fire because he does not want you to worship other gods" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
