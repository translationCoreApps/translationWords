===== translationNotes: =====

  * **reaches out with her hand to poor** - The hand is a metonym for the help the woman uses her hand to give. AT: "helps poor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **reaches out with her hands to** - These words translate the same words translated "puts her hands on" in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:31:18|31:19]].
  * **are clothed in scarlet** - Here "scarlet" does not refer to the color of the cloth, but that the clothing is expensive and warm. AT: "have expensive, warm clothing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **scarlet** - The color red, but with a hint of orange.
