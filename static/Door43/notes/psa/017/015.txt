===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will see your face in righteousness** - Here "face" represents Yahweh in all of his being. David is confident he will see Yahweh. AT: "because I act in the right way, I will be with you one day" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **I will be satisfied, when I awake, with a sight of you** - David believes that after he dies, he will be with Yahweh. This can be made clear in the translation. AT: "After I die, I will be happy to wake up in your presence" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
