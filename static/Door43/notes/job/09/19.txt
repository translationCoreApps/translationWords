  * **If it is a matter of strength** - "If there is a contest of strength"
  * **behold** - "look" or "pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **he is mighty** - "he is the strong one"
  * **who can summon him?** - This question expects an answer of "No one" to make the point that no one is able to bring God to court. This can be reworded as a statement. AT: "no one can summon him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Though I am in the right** - Here "I am in the right" means I am the one who has done right things. AT: "Although I have done right things" or "Even though I am innocent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **Though I am in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; and thought I am blameless, my words would prove me to be guilty** - This verse expresses the same idea twice for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **my own mouth would condemn me** - Here "mouth" represents Job's words. AT: "my own words would accuse me" or "what I say would condemn me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **blameless** - "faultless"
  * **my words would prove me to be guilty** - Here "my words" are spoken of as if they could take action. AT: "God would use what I say to prove me guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **guilty** - The word here has the meaning of "twisted" or "crooked."
