\v 1 Hosea says this: Do not be happy, O Israel; do not celebrate like other people groups!
\q2 You have been unfaithful to your God. You have refused to do what he told you.
\q1 At every place where people thresh their grain,
\q2 you give your offerings and sacrifices to idols.
\q1 You are just like men who pay money to sleep with women.
\q1
\v 2 Now you will not have enough grain or wine to feed your people.
\q2 You will have no hope for any new wine, for the vines will fail you.


\q1

\q
\v 1 Do not rejoice, Israel,
\q with joy like the other peoples.
\q For you have been unfaithful,
\q forsaking your God.

\q on all the threshing floors.
\q
\v 2 But the threshing floor and the winepress will not feed them;
\q the new wine will fail them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Hosea the prophet is speaking.

  * **But the threshing floor and the winepress will not feed them** - This describes the threshing floor and the winepress as if they were humans that can feed someone. This means that the harvest will not provide enough grain for threshing to meet the needs of the people, and that it will not provide the grapes for pressing to make enough wine. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the threshing floor** - These were wide areas used not only for the threshing of grain, but also for community and religious ceremonies. Temple prostitutes came in order to help the men celebrate the harvest festival to idols.
  * **the new wine will fail them** - There will not be enough grape juice to make wine with.
