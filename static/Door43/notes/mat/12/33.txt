\v 33 "Think about this: You can know whether \add a person is good and what that person says is good, in the same way that you\add* can know whether a tree \f + \ft metaphor \f* and the fruit it produces \f + \ft metaphor \f* are good. \add You can also know whether a person and what that person says is evil in the same way that you can know\add* whether a tree \f + \ft metaphor \f* and its fruit \f + \ft metaphor \f* are blighted. You can know whether a tree is good by \add seeing\add* its fruit, and similarly \add people can know the evil character of you Pharisees by listening to your accusations against me\add*.
\v 34 \add What\add* you \add teach harms people spiritually like poisonous\add* snakes \add harm them physically\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*! You are not able to speak good things because you are evil \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. Evil people \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add like you\add* speak what comes from all that is in their inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*.
\v 35 Good people \add speak good things. That is like\add* taking good things out of buildings where they are stored. But evil people \add speak evil things. That is like\add* taking evil things out of buildings where they are stored.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 33 "When you see some fruit from a tree, you decide whether the fruit is good or bad. If it is good, then you know that its tree is also good. If I am doing good things, then you should know whether or not I am good.
\v 34 You are like the children of poisonous snakes! You cannot say anything good, because you are evil. What a person says shows what is inside him.
\v 35 Good people speak good things. That is because it is like they have stored up all these good things in a safe place and can bring them out at any time. But evil people speak evil things. That is because it is like they have stored up all these evil things and bring them out at any time from the place where they store them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 33 Make a tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit.
\v 34 You offspring of vipers, since you are evil, how can you say good things? For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.
\v 35 The good man from the good treasure of his heart produces what is good, and the evil man from the evil treasure of his heart produces what is evil.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to respond to the Pharisees.

  * **Either make a tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt** - "If the fruit is good, then you know the tree is good. Or, if the fruit is bad you know the tree is bad." This is a metaphor that is similar to the one Jesus used in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:07:15|7:17]]. Jesus means that the Pharisees have proven themselves to be evil by the evil things they have said about Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **good ... bad** - "healthy ... diseased"
  * **a tree is known by its fruit** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "people know whether a tree is healthy or not by looking at its fruit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **You offspring of vipers** - Here "offspring" means "having the characteristic of." Vipers are poisonous snakes that are dangerous and represent evil. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:03:07|3:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **You ... you** - These are plural and refer to the Pharisees. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **how can you say good things?** - Jesus uses a question to rebuke the Pharisees. AT: "you cannot say good things" or "you can only say evil things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks** - Here "content of the heart" refers to the thoughts in a person's mind. The "mouth" represents a person here. AT: "what a person says reveals what is in his mind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **The good man from the good treasure of his heart brings out what is good, and the evil man from the evil treasure of his heart brings out evil** - Jesus speaks about the "heart" as if it is a container that a person fills with good or evil things. This is a metaphor that means what a person says reveals what the person is truly like. If you want to keep this imagery see the UDB. You can also translate the literal meaning. AT: "A man who is truly good will speak good things, and the man who is truly evil will speak evil things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
