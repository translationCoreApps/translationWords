===== translationNotes: =====

  * **With the east wind you break the ships of Tarshish** - Possible meanings are 1) this is a metaphor in which the author describes the kings being afraid as if they were ships that shake because God destroys them with a strong wind. AT: "They shook with fear, as the ships of Tarshish shake when you break them with the east wind" or 2) this is an apostrophe in which the author describes God's great power. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **the east wind** - Possible meanings are 1) "a wind blowing from the east" or 2) "a strong wind."
  * **the ships of Tarshish** - Possible meanings are that this refers to 1) ships that sail to or are built in the city of Tarshish or 2) any large ocean-going ship.
  * **As we have heard** - It is implied that what they have heard is the great things that God has done in the past. AT: "As we have heard about the great things that God has done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **so have we seen** - This means that they have seen the proof that the things that they have heard are true. AT: "so we have seen God do great things now" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **in the city of Yahweh of hosts, in the city of our God** - Both of these phrases refer to Jerusalem. AT: "in the city of our God, Yahweh of hosts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **establish it** - "make it secure." Here the word "establish means to preserve and make something secure.
