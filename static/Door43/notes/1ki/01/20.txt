  * **General Information:** - Bathsheba continues to speak to King David.

  * **the eyes of all Israel are on you** - Here "eyes" refers to the people. This is a generalization. AT: "all the people of Israel are watching you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **will sit on the throne** - Sitting on the throne is a metonym for being king. Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:01:13|1:13]]. AT: "will be king"
  * **when my master the king sleeps with his fathers** - Bathsheba speaks to King David as if she were speaking about him to show that she respects him. AT: "when you sleep with your fathers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **sleeps with his fathers** - This is a polite way of saying "dies." (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **I and my son Solomon will be regarded as criminals** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "the new king will regard my son Solomon and me as criminals" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
