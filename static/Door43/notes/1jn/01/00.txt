====== 1 John 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This letter does not begin in the way letters in the ancient Near East traditionally began. Instead, it begins in a similar way to the Gospel of John. Both do not really have an introduction of any kind. John appears to almost begin in the middle of an idea.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Christians and sin ==
This chapter teaches that all Christians remain sinners after they come to faith in Jesus. Despite this, God still forgives a Christian's sins. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]], [[:en:obe:kt:faith]] and [[:en:obe:kt:forgive]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
There are many metaphors in this chapter, all of which are commonly used in Scripture. Light is always used in a positive way to describe righteousness. Darkness is always used in a negative way to describe unrighteousness. The Christian life is also described as a walk. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]] and [[:en:obe:kt:unrighteous]])
