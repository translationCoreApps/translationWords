\v 3 From this area you will measure a portion that is twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide; it will be a holy place for you; a most holy place.
\v 4 It will be a holy place in the land for the priests who serve Yahweh, who come near Yahweh to serve him. It will be a place for their houses and a holy area for the holy place.
\v 5 So it will be twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide, and it will be for towns for the Levites who serve in the house.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa and it will be for towns for the Levites who serve in the house \fqa* , which some ancient and many modern versions have, the Hebrew text and some modern versions have \fqa they will possess twenty rooms \fqa* .
