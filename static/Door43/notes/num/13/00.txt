====== Numbers 13 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Spies ==

Leaders from each of the tribes went to spy the Promised Land in Canaan. Yahweh was not concerned with how many people were there because he could defeat them. It appears that he is testing the faith of the people. The people were supposed to be excited to enter this wonderful land, instead they were afraid. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland]], [[:en:obe:kt:test]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])
