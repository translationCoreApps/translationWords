===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Gad ... Asher's ... Naphtali** - These refer to the descendants of each man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **at their heels** - Here "heels" stands for the raiders who are running away from the descendants of Gad. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **food will be rich** - Here "rich" is a way of saying "delicious." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Naphtali is a doe let loose** - Jacob speaks about the descendants of Naphtali as if they were a female deer that is free to run. This may emphasize that they will be swift messengers. AT: "The descendants of Naphtali will be like deer set free" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **have beautiful fawns** - A "fawn" is a baby deer. The meaning of the Hebrew word is unclear. Some versions translate it as "have beautiful words" or "speak beautiful things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
