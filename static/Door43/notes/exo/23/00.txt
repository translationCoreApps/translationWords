====== Exodus 23 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Justice in society ==
The rules and laws of this chapter are not intended to be followed by every society. Israel was God's chosen nation and were required to live in a special way. These laws concerned creating a just society and a holy nation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:elect]], [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]], [[:en:obe:kt:justice]] and [[:en:obe:kt:holy]])

== Celebrations of feasts and festivals ==
The people of Israel were required to celebrate certain feasts and festivals. These were part of the law of Moses and some are described in this chapter. Their purpose was to worship Yahweh and to remember the great things Yahweh has done for them.
