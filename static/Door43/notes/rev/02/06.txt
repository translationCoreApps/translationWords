\v 6 But you do one thing very well: Those Nicolaitans, the people who say you can worship idols and act immorallyâ€”you hate what they do, just as I hate it.
\v 7 Everyone who wants to understand my message must listen carefully to the message that God's Spirit is saying to the groups of believers assembled together. The message is this: I will allow those who are victorious to eat fruit from the tree that gives eternal life, the tree that is in God's garden.'"

\v 6 But you have this: You hate what the Nicolaitans have done, which I also hate.
\v 7 Let the one who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To the one who conquers I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God."'"
