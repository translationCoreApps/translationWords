===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he spoke with me** - If your language has to identify the one speaking, it would be best to identify the speaker as the "one who looked like a man" ([[:en:bible:notes:ezk:01:26|1:26]]). It was not "the Spirit."
  * **they will place ropes upon you and tie you so you cannot go out among them** - This is best translated literally.
