===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They tremble** - The word "they" refers to those who do evil things.
  * **God is with the righteous assembly** - To say that "God is with" those who are righteous means that he helps them. This can be stated clearly in the translation. AT: "God helps those who act righteously" (UDB) or "God helps those who do the right things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **You want** - The word "you" refers to the wicked people.
  * **to humiliate the poor person** - "to make the poor person feel ashamed"
  * **Yahweh is his refuge** - This speaks of the protection that Yahweh provides as if he were a shelter that one might seek in a storm. AT: "Yahweh is like a shelter of protection to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
