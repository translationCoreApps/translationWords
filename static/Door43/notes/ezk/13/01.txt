===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **prophesying out of their own imaginations** - "prophesying only the things that they imagine"
  * **who follow their own spirit** - Here the word "spirit" represents the thoughts and ideas of the person. To "follow" here is an idiom that means to do what their own ideas suggest for them to do. AT: "who act according to their own ideas" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **like jackals in the wastelands** - Like jackals that scavenge for food and shelter among the abandoned ruins of cities, the prophets are using the destruction of Jerusalem for their own benefit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **jackals** - wild animals that are related to dogs and that scavenge for food in abandoned places.
