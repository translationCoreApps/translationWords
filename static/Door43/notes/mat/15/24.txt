===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I was not sent to anyone** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God did not send me to anyone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **to the lost sheep of the house of Israel** - This is a metaphor comparing the entire nation of Israel to sheep who have strayed from their shepherd. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:05|10:6]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **she came** - "the Canaanite woman came"
  * **bowed down before him** - This shows that the woman is humbling herself before Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs** - Jesus responds to the woman with a proverb. The basic meaning is that it is not right to take what is supposed to belong to Jews and give it to non-Jews. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]])
  * **little dogs** - Use words here for dogs of any size that people keep as pets.
  * **the children's bread** - Here "bread" refers to food in general. AT: "the children's food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) 
  * **the little dogs** - The Jews considered dogs to be unclean animals. Here they are used as an image for non-Jews.
