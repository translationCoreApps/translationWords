\q1
\v 6 Those who make fun of being wise will never become wise,

\b
\q1
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 You can tell if a witness is reliable, if he tells the truth,
\q2 but when a witness breaths out lie after lie, he is a false witness and cannot be depended on.
\q1
\v 6 One who thinks he is better than others, he may seek wisdom, but he will not find it,
\q2 but the one who has grown in knowledge can easily learn much more.

\q1
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 5 A faithful witness does not lie,
\q but a false witness breathes out lies.
\q
\v 6 A mocker seeks wisdom and there is none,
\q but knowledge comes easy to the one who is discerning.
