===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Jesus led them out** - "Jesus led the disciples outside the city"
  * **He lifted up his hands** - This was the action that priests performed when they blessed the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **It happened** - "It came about." This introduces a new event in the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])
  * **while he was blessing them** - "while Jesus was asking God to do good to them"
  * **was carried** - Since Luke does not specify who carried Jesus up, we do not know if it was God himself or one or more angels. If your language has to specify who did the carrying, it would be best to use "went" as the UDB does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
