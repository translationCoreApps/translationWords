====== 2 Corinthians 02 General Notes ======

=== Special Concepts ===

== Harsh writing ==
This chapter is, in large part, written in reference to a previous letter Paul wrote to the Corinthians. This letter had a harsh, corrective time. It probably was written in between the letter known as First Corinthians and this letter. It also references a specific situation in the church which can only be understood implicitly. It is probable that the church was forced to rebuke an erring member and now Paul is encouraging them to show grace to this person. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:grace]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Aroma ==
A sweet aroma or smell is pleasing. This is an important image in Scripture. Things that are pleasing to God are often described as having a pleasing aroma.
