\v 27 Absalom pressed David, and so he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
\v 28 Absalom commanded his servants saying, "Listen closely. When Amnon begins to be drunk with wine, and when I say to you, 'Attack Amnon,' then kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and brave."
\v 29 So Absalom's servants did to Amnon as he had commanded them. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man mounted his mule and fled.
