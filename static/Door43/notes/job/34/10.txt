<usfm>
\q
\v 10 So listen to me, you men of understanding:
\q far be it from God that he should do wickedness;
\q far be it from the Almighty that he should commit sin.
\q
\v 11 For he pays back a person's work;
\q he makes every man come upon the reward of his own ways.
\q
\v 12 Indeed, God does nothing wicked,
\q nor does the Almighty ever pervert justice.

  * **General Information:** - Elihu continues speaking. Each of these verses contain parallel phrases. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **you men of understanding** - Elihu is criticizing Job and his friends. He does not actually think they are wise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **far be it from God ... far be it from the Almighty that he should commit sin** - These two phrases have the same meaning and are used together to emphasize that God would never do anything wrong. The phrase "far be it from" is an idiom. AT: "Almighty God would never consider doing anything that is wicked or wrong!" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **For he pays back a person's work** - This means that he gives to a person what he deserves for the work he has done. Here "work" is a metaphor for what a person does. AT: "For he gives to a person what he deserves in return for he does" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he makes every man come upon the reward of his own ways** - The phrase "his own ways" is an idiom for how a person lives his life. Elihu emphasizes that God gives to people what they deserve. AT: "he causes every man to receive the reward he deserves for how he lives" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
