====== Matthew 09 General Notes ======

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

There are many different figures of speech in this chapter. It was also common for Jesus to use analogies and metaphors in his teaching. His way of teaching was intended to encourage faith in him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "And," "but" ==
Some English translations begin many sentences in this chapter with the word "and" or "but" to indicate a sequence of events in the narrative. The ULB usually eliminates these words because the context of the narrative itself indicates that the events occur in sequence. It is acceptable add these words if it is helpful in your translation.
