\v 4 I, John, am writing this letter to the seven groups of believers in the province of Asia. May God be kind to you and give you peace, for he is the one who has always existed, who exists now, and who will always exist in the future. May the seven spirits who are sitting in front of his throne do these things for you, too.
\v 5 May Jesus Christ also—who has faithfully told us the truth about God and—be kind to you and give you peace. For he is the first one whom God raised from the dead, and he is the one who rules the kings of the earth. He is the one who loves us and who has freed us from the guilt of our sins by his blood when he died on the cross.
\v 6 He is the one who has begun to rule over his kingdom; he has set us apart to be priests who worship God his Father as he commanded. It is Jesus Christ whom we must honor and praise forever. This is the truth.

\v 5 and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead ones, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To the one who loves us and has released us from our sins by his blood—
\v 6 he has made us a kingdom, priests for his God and Father—to him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is the beginning of John's letter. Here he names himself as the writer and greets the people he is writing to.

  * **May grace be to you and peace from the one who is ... and from the seven spirits ... and from Jesus Christ** - This is a wish or blessing. John speaks as if these were things that God could give, although they are really ways in which  he hopes God will act for his people. AT: "May he who is ... and the seven spirits ... and Jesus Christ treat you kindly and enable you to live peacefully and securely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **from the one who is** - "from God, who is"
  * **who is to come** - Existing in the future is spoken of as coming. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **seven spirits** - The number seven is a symbol of completeness and perfection.  The "seven spirits" refers either to the Spirit of God or to seven spirits who serve God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **the firstborn from the dead ones** - "the first person to be raised from death"  
  * **has released us** - "has set us free"
  * **has made us a kingdom, priests** - "has set us apart and begun to rule over us and he has made us priests"
  * **his God and Father** - This is one person. AT: "God, his Father"
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **to him be the glory and the power** - This is a wish or prayer. Possible meanings are 1) "May people honor his glory and power" or 2) "May he have glory and power." John prays that Jesus Christ will be honored and will be able to rule completely over everyone and everything. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]]) 
  * **the power** - This probably refers to his authority as king.
