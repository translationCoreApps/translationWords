===== translationNotes: =====

  * **At a time I decide to show my favor I will answer you, and in a day of salvation I will help you** - These two clauses mean basically the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I will answer you** - Here "you" refers to Yahweh's servant.
  * **in a day of salvation** - Here the word "day" refers to a specific time and not to a 24-hour day. The word "salvation" can be translated as a verb. AT: "when the time comes for me to save you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **give you as a covenant for the people** - Here the word "covenant" is a metonym for the one who establishes or mediates a covenant. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:42:05|42:6]]. AT: "make you be the mediator of a covenant with the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to rebuild the land** - Here the word "land" represents the cities in the land that had been destroyed. AT: "to rebuild the ruined places in the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to reassign the desolate inheritance** - Yahweh speaks of the land as if it were an inheritance that the people of Israel received as a permanent possession. It is implied that the servant is to reassign the land to the people of Israel. AT: "to reassign the desolate land to the people of Israel as their inheritance" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
