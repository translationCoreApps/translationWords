\q1

\q2 Do you know where the road is that goes there?
\q1
\v 21 I am sure that you know these things,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
  * **General Information:** - Yahweh uses three questions to emphasize that he understands light and darkness and Job does not. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **General Information:** - Each of these verses have two parallel phrases. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Where is the way to the resting place of light—as for darkness, where is its place?** - This question can be expressed as a statement. AT: "You do not know the way to the resting place of light or the place of darkness." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the resting place of light** - "the dwelling of light." Light is spoken of as having a resting place from which it comes forth each day. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **light** - "daylight" or "sunlight"
  * **Can you lead light and darkness to their places of work? Can you find the way back to their houses for them?** - These questions expect a negative answer. They can be expressed as statements. AT: "You cannot lead light and darkness to their places of work, or find the way back to their houses for them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to their places of work** - "to their territory." Light and darkness are spoken of as being led out and back each day to accomplish Yahweh's purposes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Undoubtedly ... so large** - Yahweh uses mocking irony to emphasize that Job does not understand light and darkness. AT: "It is obvious that you do not know, because you were not born when I created them, and you are not very old." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **for you were born then** - "for you were already living then." The word "then" refers to the time when light was created and separated from darkness. AT: "for you were already born when I created them"
  * **the number of your days is so large** - "you have lived so many years"
