\v 14 Now it was the day before the Passover Festival, the day of preparation. It was almost noontime when Pilate said to the Jews, "See, here is your king!"
\v 15 They shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Should I crucify your king?" The chief priests replied, "We have no king but Caesar!"
\v 16 So Pilate handed Jesus over to them, and they took him away.
