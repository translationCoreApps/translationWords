\v 5 Then the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem, the city that was especially for God. He set him on the highest part of the temple
\v 6 and said to him, "If you are truly the Son of God, jump down to the ground. You will, of course, not be hurt, because God has said in the scriptures, 
\q
'God will command his angels to protect you. 
\q They will lift you up in their hands when you are falling, \q and they will keep you from even hitting your foot on a stone.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verse 6, Satan quotes from the Psalms in order to tempt Jesus.

  * **If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down** - Possible meanings are 1) this is a temptation to do a miracle for Jesus' own benefit. AT: "Since you are truly the Son of God, you can throw yourself down." Or, 2) this is a challenge or accusation. AT: "Prove that you are truly the Son of God by throwing yourself down" (UDB). It is best to assume that Satan knew that Jesus is the Son of God.
  * **Son of God** - This is an important title that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **throw yourself down** - "let yourself fall to the ground" or "jump down"
  * **for it is written** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "for the writer wrote in the scriptures" or "for it says in the scriptures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **He will command his angels to take care of you** - "God will command his angels to take care of you." This can be translated with a direct quotation. AT: "God will say to his angels, 'Take care of him'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **They will lift you up** - "The angels will hold you"
