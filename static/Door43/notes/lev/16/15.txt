\v 15 \add Aaron must then go outside the Sacred Tent\add*and slaughter the goat to be an offering for the sins of the people. Then he must bring its blood into the Very Holy Place behind the curtain. There he must sprinkle \add some of\add* that blood on the lid of the sacred chest and against the front of the chest, like he did with the bull's blood.
\v 16 By doing that, he will purify the Very Holy Place. And he must sprinkle more of the blood on the Sacred Tent, because the tent is in the midst of the camp of the Israelite people who have become unacceptable to me \add because of their sins\add*.

\v 15 Then he must kill the goat for the sin offering that is for the people and bring its blood inside the curtain. There he must do with the blood as he did with the blood of the bull: he must sprinkle it on the atonement lid and then before the atonement lid.
\v 16 He must make atonement for the holy place because of the unclean actions of the people of Israel, and because of their rebellion and all their sins. He must also do this for the tent of meeting, where Yahweh lives among them, in the presence of their unclean actions.

  * **unclean actions** - Sinful actions which make people unacceptable to Yahweh are spoken of as if they were physically unclean actions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in the presence of their unclean actions** - The phrase "their unclean actions" represents the people who commit sinful actions. AT: "in the presence of people who commit sinful actions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
