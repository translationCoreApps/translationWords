\v 17 But when they urged Elisha until he was ashamed, he said, "Send them." Then they sent fifty men, and they looked for three days, but did not find him.
\v 18 They came back to Elisha, while he stayed at Jericho, and he said to them, "Did I not say to you, 'Do not go'?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But when they urged Elisha until he was ashamed** - The sons of the prophets kept asking Elisha until he felt bad about saying "no." AT: "They kept asking Elisha until he felt bad for denying their request, so" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Did I not say to you, 'Do not go'?** - Elisha uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that he had told them previously what would happen. This can be written as a statement. AT: "I told you that you should not go, because you would not find him!" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
