===== translationNotes: =====

  * **[The woman speaking to herself]** - The woman is probably speaking to herself hoping that no other young man will take her away. 
  * **the jackals** - This could also be translated as "the foxes." These animals look like small dogs and were often used in love poetry to represent eager young men who would spoil a young lady. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for us** - The word "us" could possibly refer to 1) the woman and her lover or 2) the woman and the rest of her family.
  * **the little jackals** - "the young jackals." Jackals give birth to their young in the spring when the vines are blooming.
  * **that spoil** - "that wreck" or "that destroy." Jackals and foxes destroy vineyards by digging holes and eating vines and grapes. This could also represent the young men who spoil the young ladies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in blossom** - This could represent a young lady ready for marriage and bearing children. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:12|2:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
