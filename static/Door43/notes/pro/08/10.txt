<usfm>
\v 10 \add If someone offers you the kind of teaching I give\add* or offers you silver,
\q2 choose my teaching.
\q1 \add If he offers to show you how to be wise\add* or offers you gold,
\q2 choose to know how to be wise,
\q2

\q1
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Choose what I teach you,
\q2 instead of trying to get much silver;
\q1 and choose the knowledge I will show you, for it is more valuable than gold.
\q2
\v 11 For I, Wisdom, am more precious than jewels;
\q2 nothing is as valuable for you as I am.


\q1

  * **Acquire my instruction rather than silver** - "You should try much harder to understand my instructions than to get silver"
  * **For Wisdom is better than jewels; no treasure is equal to her** - Here Wisdom, personified as a woman, is not speaking. However, it is possible to make Wisdom the speaker here as well. AT: "For I, Wisdom, am better than jewels; no treasure is equal to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
