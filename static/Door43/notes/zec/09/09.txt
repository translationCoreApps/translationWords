\q
\v 9 Shout with great joy, daughter of Zion! Shout with happiness, daughter of Jerusalem!
\q Behold! Your king is coming to you with righteousness
\q and is rescuing you. He is humble and is riding on a donkey, on the colt of a donkey.
\q
\v 10 Then I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow will be cut off from battle; for
he will speak peace to the nations, and his dominion will be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Shout with great joy, daughter of Zion! Shout with happiness, daughter of Jerusalem!** - These two sentences mean the same thing and intensify the command to rejoice. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **daughter of Zion ... daughter of Jerusalem** - "Zion" is the same as "Jerusalem." The prophet speaks of the city as if it is a daughter. See how you translated "daughter of Zion" in [[:en:bible:notes:zec:02:10|2:10]].
  * **on a donkey, on the colt of a donkey** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and refer to one animal. The second phrase clarifies that this is a young donkey. AT: "on a young donkey." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **cut off the chariot from Ephraim** - AT: "destroy the chariots in Israel that are used for battle"
  * **the horse from Jerusalem** - AT: "the warhorses in Jerusalem"
  * **the bow will be cut off from battle** - Here the bow represents all weapons used in warfare. AT: "all weapons of war will be destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **for he will speak peace to the nations** - Here the action of announcing peace represents the action of making peace. AT: "for your king will bring peace to the nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]}
  * **his dominion will be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth!** - "his kingdom will be over all the earth!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
