===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will restore** - The word "I" refers to Yahweh.
  * **he will graze on Carmel and Bashan** - "Israel will feed on the foods of Carmel and Bashan."
  * **In those days and at that time** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:33:14|33:15]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **iniquity will be looked for in Israel, but none will be found. I will inquire about the sins of Judah, but none will be found** - These two lines mean basically the same thing. Together they emphasize that Yahweh will forgive the sins of the people of Israel completely. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **iniquity will be looked for in Israel, but none will be found** - AT: "Yahweh will look for iniquity in the people of Israel, but will not find any" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
