\v 14 The people of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh said to Joshua, "You allotted to us only one area of land, but we are very numerous. Yahweh has blessed us very much \add with the result that our tribe has grown very large\add*. So why did you give us only a small part of the land \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?"
\p
\v 15 Joshua replied to them, "\add I agree that\add* you do not have enough land in the hilly area of the tribe of Ephraim. So, since you have a lot of people, I will allot more land to you, in the hilly region. But you will have to \add cut down the trees\add* in the forest and make a place for yourselves in the land where the Periz and Repha people-groups live."

\v 14 The descendants of Joseph (that is, the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh) said to Joshua, "You have assigned to us only one area of land, but we have a great number of people in our tribes. In every way Yahweh has blessed us, so why did you give us only a small portion of land to live on?"
\p
\v 15 Joshua replied to them, "Since you have a lot of people, go up and cut down the trees in the forest and make a place for your crops and for yourselves to live in the land of the Perizzites and the Raphaim. This is what you must do, since the hill country is too cramped for you to live there."

\p
\v 14 Then the descendants of Joseph said to Joshua, saying, "Why have you given us only one assignment of land and one portion for an inheritance, since we are a people great in number, and all along Yahweh has blessed us?"
\v 15 Joshua said to them, "If you are a people great in number, go up by yourselves to the forest and there clear the ground for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim. Do this, since the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you."
