<usfm>
\v 9 I am praying for you, that you might love each other more and more, and that you might know and understand why God wants you to do so.
\v 10 I also pray that God will enable you to know what you should believe and the best ways in which you should act. I pray for this so that you might be honest and blameless at the time when Christ returns.
\v 11 I also pray that you will always do the things that you can do because God has declared you good in his sight because of Jesus Christ. Then other people will see how you honor God.

<usfm>
\v 9 And I am praying this: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all understanding.
\v 10 I pray for this so that you may test and choose the things that are excellent. I pray for this so that that you may be sincere and without offense on the day of Christ.
\v 11 This is also so that you will be filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul prays for the believers in Philippi and talks about the joy there is in suffering for the Lord.

  * **may abound** - Paul speaks of love as if it were objects that people could obtain more of. AT: "may increase" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in knowledge and all understanding** - Here "understanding" means about God and can be made explicit. AT: "as you learn and understand more about what pleases God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **test and choose** - If your language has one word that describes the process of examining objects and taking only those that are good, you should use it here.
  * **the things that are excellent** - "what is most pleasing to God"
  * **sincere and without offense** - The words "sincere" and "without offense" mean basically the same thing. Paul combines them to emphasize moral purity. AT: "completely blameless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **you will be filled** - Paul is speaking of the believers as if they were containers that could be filled with fruit. AT: "This is also so that Jesus Christ may cause you to obey God more and more" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes** - The good deeds of a believer whom God has declared good please God as does the way fruit growing on a tree is sweet to those who eat it. AT: "able to please God and other people by the way you live now that God has forgiven your sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to the glory and praise of God** - Possible meanings are 1) "Then other people will see how you honor God" (UDB) or 2) "Then people will praise and give honor to God because of the good things they see you do." These alternate translations would require a new sentence.
