\v 10 Although God is being patient, at the time that he has appointed, the Lord Jesus Christ will certainly come back to judge people. He will come back unexpectedly, like a thief comes unexpectedly. At that time there will be a great roaring sound. The heavens will cease to exist. The elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it that anyone has ever done will be revealed to God for him to judge.
