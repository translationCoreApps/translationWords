===== translationNotes: =====

  * **See** - "Indeed." The word "See" here adds emphasis to what follows.
  * **and covers the roots of the sea** - Elihu speaks of the deep parts of the sea as if the sea were a plant and its depths were its roots. Possible meanings are 1) although the lightening causes light in the sky, the deep parts of the sea remain dark. AT: "but the depths of the sea remain dark" or 2) the lightening in the sky cause even the depths of the sea to have light. AT: "and lights up the depths of the sea" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
