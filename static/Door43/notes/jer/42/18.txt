\v 18 For Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: Just as my wrath and my fury were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, in the same way my fury will be poured out on you if you go to Egypt. You will become an object of cursing and a horror, an object for speaking curses, and something dishonorable. And you will not see this place again.'"
\v 19 Then Jeremiah said, "Yahweh has spoken concerning youâ€”the remnant of Judah. Do not go to Egypt! You certainly know that I have been a witness against you today.
