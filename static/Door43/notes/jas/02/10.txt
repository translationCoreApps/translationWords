<usfm>
\v 10 Do not forget that those who disobey only one of God's laws, even if they obey all \add his other\add* laws, \add God considers them\add* to be \add as guilty as anyone who has disobeyed\add* all \add of\add* God's\add laws\add*.
\v 11 For example, \add God\add* said, "Do not commit adultery," but he also said, "Do not murder anyone." \add So\add* if you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* do not commit adultery but you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* murder someone, you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* have become a person who disobeys \add God's\add* laws.

\v 10 Those who disobey only one of God's laws, even if they obey all his other laws, God considers to be as guilty as anyone who has disobeyed all of his laws.
\v 11 For example, God said, "Do not commit adultery," but he also said, "Do not murder anyone." So if you do not commit adultery but you murder someone, you have become a person who disobeys God's laws.

\v 10 For whoever obeys the whole law, except that he stumbles in just a single way, has become guilty of breaking the whole law.
\v 11 For the one who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not murder." If you do not commit adultery, but if you do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For whoever obeys** - "For anyone who obeys"
  * **except that he stumbles ... the whole law** - Stumbling is falling down while one is trying to walk. Disobeying one point of the law is spoken of as if it were stumbling while walking. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in just a single way** - because of disobedience to just one requirement of the law
  * **For the one who said** - This is referring to God giving the law to Moses.
  * **Do not commit** - To "commit" is to do an action.
  * **If you ... but if you ... you have** - Here "you" means "each one of you." Although James was writing to many Jewish believers, in this case, he used the singular form as if he was writing to each person individually. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
