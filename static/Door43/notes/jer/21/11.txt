===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Concerning the house of the king of Judah, listen to the word of Yahweh** - This may serve as a title for 21:12 - 23:8. AT: "Listen to what Yahweh says about the king of Judah, his family, and his servants"
  * **the house of the king of Judah** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to the royal descendants of that kings. AT: "descendants of the king of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **House of David** - This refers to the same people as "the house of the king of Judah." All of the kings of Judah were descendants of David. AT: "Descendants of David" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Bring about justice in the morning** - The abstract noun "justice" can be stated as an action. AT: "Always treat the people whom you rule over fairly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the hand of the oppressor** - Here "hand" refers to power. AT: "the power of the one who oppresses them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **my fury will go out like fire and burn** - Here Yahweh's punishment is spoken of as if it was a fire that would burn up those who did evil. AT: "I will punish and destroy you in my anger quickly and completely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **there is no one who can quench it** - Jeremiah continues the simile of Yahweh's punishment as a fire that was so hot that no one could put it out with water. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
