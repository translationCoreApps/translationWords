\v 9 \add And he also says\add*, "You plead with me to act mercifully toward you. But you bring to me sacrifices that are not acceptable to me, so why should I act kindly toward you?"

\v 8 You offer for sacrifices animals that are blind. Is that not wrong? You offer animals that are sick or lame. Do you really think I would accept such gifts? You would not dare to offer such gifts to your own governor! You know that he would not take them. You know that he would be displeased with you and would not welcome you!"
\m That is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says!
\p
\v 9 I, Malachi, see you continually go through the motions of asking God to help us. But Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says,
\pi "If you bring to me sacrifices that are not acceptable to me, why should I help you?"

\v 8 When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, is that not evil? When you offer the lame and sick, is that not evil? Present that to your governor! Will he accept you or will he lift up your face?" says Yahweh of hosts.
\v 9 Now you keep asking the face of God, that he may be gracious to us. But Yahweh of hosts says that with such an offering in your hand, would he lift up any of your faces?
