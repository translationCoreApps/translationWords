===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus finishes speaking to the crowd.

  * **all you** - All occurrences of "you" are plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **who labor and are heavy burdened** - Jesus is speaking about the people as if they are animals, which their masters have made to carry too much weight on their backs. This is a metaphor for all the laws and rules the Jewish leaders expect the people to obey. AT: "who labor under all the laws the religious leaders place on you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will give you rest** - "I will allow you to rest from your labor and burden"
  * **Take my yoke on you** - Jesus continues the metaphor. Jesus is inviting the people to become his disciples and follow him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I am meek and lowly in heart** - Here "meek" and "lowly in heart" mean basically the same thing. Jesus combines them to emphasize that he will be much more kind than the religious leaders. AT: "I am gentle and humble" (UDB) or "I am very gentle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **lowly in heart** - This is an idiom that means "humble." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **you will find rest for your souls** - Here "soul" refers to the entire person. AT: "you will find rest for yourselves" or "you will be able to rest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **For my yoke is easy and my burden is light** - Both of these phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is emphasizing that it is easier to obey him than it is the Jewish law. AT: "For what I place on you, you will be able to carry because it is light" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **my burden is light** - The word "light" here is the opposite of heavy, not the opposite of dark.
