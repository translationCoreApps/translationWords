===== translationNotes: =====

  * **oceans ... oceans'** - Some versions read "floods ... floods'." The word often refer to a river (see "the River," [[:en:bible:notes:psa:072:008|72:8]]), but "oceans ... oceans'" has been chosen here because oceans, not rivers, have "waves" that "crash and roar."
  * **have lifted up their voice; the oceans' waves crash and roar** - The psalmist speaks of the ocean as if it were a person who could speak. AT: "have made a mighty noise because their waves crash and roar" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **roar** - make a long, loud sound.
  * **Above the crashing of many waves, the mighty breakers of the sea** - The phrase "the mighty breakers of the sea" means basically the same thing as "many waves" and emphasizes how great these waves are. AT: "Above the crashing of all of the very great waves of the sea" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **breakers** - large waves coming to land
  * **on high** - The psalmist speaks of where God lives as if it were high above the earth. AT: "in heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
