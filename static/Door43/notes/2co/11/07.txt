\v 7 \add I refused to accept money\add* from you as pay for teaching you God's message about Christ. It is ridiculous for you to think that what I did was wrong!\f + \ft Or: Was that wrong? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add I know that by teaching you without pay\add*, I made myself seem \f + \ft irony \f* unimportant to you. \add But I did it\add* to honor you.
\v 8 \add Some people might say that it was as though\add* \f + \ft irony \f* I was robbing other congregations because I accepted money from them in order that I might work among you.
\v 9 Furthermore, when I was \add there\add* with you and had no \add money to buy the things that I needed\add*, I did not cause any difficulty to any \add of you\add* \add by depending on you\f + \ft Or: by asking you for money, Or: support\add* \f*, because our\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* fellow believers who came from \add here in\add* Macedonia \add province\add* brought enough \add money for me to buy everything\add* that I needed. So I have not caused you any difficulty at all \add by asking you for money\add*, and I never will \add ask you for money\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*.

\v 7 Was I wrong to serve you as a humble person in such a way that others praised you instead of me? Was I wrong to preach the good news to you without charging any money?
\v 8 Yes, I allowed believers in other churches to give me money so I could serve you. Maybe you will say that I was robbing them. But I asked you for nothing.
\v 9 There was a time when I was with you that I needed many things, but I did not ask you for any money at all. The brothers who came from Macedonia provided all I needed, instead. I have done everything I could for you not to be in hardship because of me, and this I will continue to do.

\v 7 Did I sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted? For I freely preached the gospel of God to you.
\v 8 I robbed other churches by accepting support from them so that I could serve you.
\v 9 When I was with you and I was in need, I did not burden anyone. For my needs were met by the brothers who came from Macedonia. In everything I have kept myself from being a burden to you, and I will continue to do that.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Did I sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted?** - Paul is beginning to claim that he treated the Corinthians well. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement, if necessary. AT: "I think we agree that I did not sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **freely** - "without expecting anything from you in return"
  * **I robbed other churches** - This is an exaggeration to emphasize that Paul took money from other churches. AT: "I accepted money from other churches" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **I could serve you** - The full meaning of this can be made explicit. AT: "I could serve you at no cost" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **In everything I have kept myself from being a burden to you** - "I have never in any way been a financial burden to you." Paul speaks of someone for whom one has to spend money as if they were heavy items that people have to carry. The full meaning of this can be made explicit. AT: "I have done all I can to make sure you do not have to spend money so that I can be with you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the brothers who came** - These "brothers" were probably all male.
  * **I will continue to do that** - "I never will be a burden to you"
