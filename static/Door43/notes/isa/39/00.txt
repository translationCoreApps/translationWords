====== Isaiah 39 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Pride ==
Although it is not said why it was sinful for Hezekiah to show the king of Babylon his riches, it was probably pride. It can be viewed as bragging to another king about how rich and powerful he was without giving proper credit to Yahweh. Therefore, Yahweh punished him. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== Babylon ==
At this time, Babylon was not very powerful. It was little more than a city. In a short time, they became a very powerful nation and conquered Assyria.
