\v 8 \add When I read that message\add*, I sent \add the messenger\add* back to Sanballat to say, "None of what you are saying is true. You have made this up\f + \ft Or: concocted this \f* in your own head, Or: mind."
\v 9 \add I said that because I knew that\add* they were trying to cause us to be afraid, with the result that we would stop working \add on the wall\add*. So I actually became more determined \f + \ft Or: I prayed to God to help me \f* \add to continue the work\add*.

\v 8 When I read that message, I sent the messenger back to Sanballat to say, "None of what you are saying is true. You have made this up in your own imagination."
\v 9 I said that because I knew that they were trying to cause us to be afraid, so that they thought, "They will become so discouraged that they will not work on the wall any more, and the work will never be finished." So I prayed, "O God, give me courage."

\v 8 Then I sent word to him saying, "No such things have occurred as you say, for within your heart you invented them."
\v 9 For they all wanted to make us afraid, thinking, "They will drop their hands from doing the work, and it will not be done." But now, God, please strengthen my hands.
