  * **behold** - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **who appeared in glorious splendor** - This phrase gives information about how Moses and Elijah looked. Some languages would translate it as a separate clause. AT: "and they appeared in glorious splendor" and "and they were shining brightly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])
  * **his departure** - "his leaving" or "how Jesus would leave this world." This was a polite way of talking about his death. AT: "his death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
