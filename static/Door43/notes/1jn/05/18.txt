===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - John closes his letter, reviewing what he has said about the new nature of believers which cannot sin and reminds them to keep themselves from idols.

  * **the whole world lies** - "World" is a way in which some biblical writers refer to the people living in the world who are in rebellion against God and to the world system that is affected in every way by the corrupting power of sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in the evil one** - That is, in the power of the evil one. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
