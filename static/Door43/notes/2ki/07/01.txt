  * **a measure of fine flour ... two measures of barley** - Here the word "measure" translates the word "seah," which is a unit of dry measurement equal to about 7 liters. AT: "7 liters of fine flour ... 14 liters of barley" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bvolume]])
  * **a shekel** - A shekel is a unit of weight equal to about 11 grams. AT: "about 11 grams of silver" or "one silver coin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]])
