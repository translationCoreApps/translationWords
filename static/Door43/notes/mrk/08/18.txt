===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You have eyes, do you not see? You have ears, do you not hear? Do you not remember?** - Jesus continues to mildly rebuke his disciples. These questions can be written as statements. AT: "You have eyes, but you do not understand what you see. You have ears, but you do not understand what you hear. You should remember." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the five thousand** - This refers to the 5,000 people Jesus fed. AT: "the 5,000 people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **how many baskets full of broken pieces of bread did you take up** - It may be helpful to state when they collected the baskets of pieces. AT: "how many baskets full of broken pieces of bread did you collect after everyone finished eating" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
