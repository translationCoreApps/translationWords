\v 11 But you, man of God, flee from these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faithfulness, love, endurance, and gentleness.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But you** - Here "you" is singular and refers to Timothy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **man of God** - "servant of God" or "person who belongs to God"
  * **flee from these things** - Paul speaks of these temptations and sins as if they were things that a person could physically run away from. AT: "treat these things like creatures who want to harm you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **these things** - Possible meanings of "these things" are 1) the "love of money" (UDB) or 2) the different teachings, pride, arguments, and the love of money.
  * **Pursue righteousness** - "Run after" or "Chase." Paul speaks of righteousness and other good qualities as if they were things that a person could run after.This idiom is the opposite of "flee from." It means to try your best to obtain something. AT: "Seek to gain" or "Do your best to act in" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Fight the good fight of faith** - Here Paul speaks about a person continuing in faith as if they are an athlete fighting to win a contest or a warrior fighting a battle. AT: "Try your hardest to obey Christ's teachings with as much energy as an athlete uses in a contest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Take hold of the everlasting life** - This continues the metaphor. Paul speaks about a person receiving eternal life as if they are a victorious athlete or warrior taking their prize. AT: "Take eternal life as your reward as a victorious athlete takes his prize" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to which you were called** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "to which God has called you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
