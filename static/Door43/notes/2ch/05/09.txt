\v 10 The only things that were inside the Sacred Chest were the two stone tablets that Moses had put there at Sinai Mountain, where Yahweh made an agreement with the Israelite people after they came out of Egypt.

\v 9 The poles were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the inner room, but they could not be seen from outside. They are there to this day.
\v 10 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the people of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
