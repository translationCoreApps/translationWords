\v 6 He said to the judges, "Consider what you should do, because you are not judging for man, but for Yahweh; he is with you in the act of judging.
\v 7 Now then, let the fear of Yahweh be upon you. Be careful when you judge, for there is no iniquity with Yahweh our God, nor is there any favoritism or bribe taking."
