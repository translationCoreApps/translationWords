\v 6  \add Well, we\add* truly do gain great  \add benefit\add* when we conduct our lives in a  \add godly manner\f + \ft Or: \add*in a  \add manner that pleases God\add* \f* and we are content  \add with what we have\add*.
\v 7 We brought nothing into the world  \add when we were born\add*, and we cannot take anything out  \add of it when we die\add*,

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Well, we truly do gain great benefit when we behave in a way that honors God and when we are content with what we have.
\v 7 Indeed, we brought nothing into the world when we were born, and we cannot take anything out of it when we die.
\v 8 So if we have food and clothing, we should be satisfied with these.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Now godliness with contentment is great gain.
\v 7 For we have brought nothing into the world. Neither are we able to take out anything.
\v 8 Instead, let us be satisfied with food and clothing.
</usfm>

  * [[:en:obe:kt:godly]] 

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - This marks a break in the teaching. Here Paul begins to contrast the kind of riches the wicked people seek through godliness ([[:en:bible:notes:1ti:06:03|6:5]]) and the true kind of gain people receive through godliness. AT: "Of course"
  * **godliness with contentment is great gain** - The words "godliness" and "contentment" are abstract nouns. AT: "it is great gain for a person to do what is godly and to be content with what they have" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **is great gain** - "provides great benefits" or "does many good things for us"
  * **brought nothing into the world** - "brought nothing into the world when we were born"(UDB)
  * **Neither are we able to take out anything** - "And we can take nothing out of the world when we die"
  * **let us** - "we should"
