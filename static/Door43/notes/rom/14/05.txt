\v 6 As for those who believe that they should worship on \add a certain\add* day \add of the week\add*, it is to \add honor\add* the Lord \add that they worship on that day\add*. And as for those who \add think that it is all right to\add* eat \add all kinds of food\add*, it is to \add honor\add* the Lord \add that they eat those foods\add*, as is clear from their thanking God \add for the food that they eat\add*. As for those who abstain from \add eating certain kinds of\add* food, it is to \add honor\add* the Lord that they do not eat \add those foods\add*, and they also thank God \add for the food that they do eat.

\v 5 Some people regard certain days as more holy than other days. Other people regard all days as equally suitable for worshiping God. Each person should be fully convinced about such matters, thinking and deciding for himself and not for others.
\v 6 As for those who believe that they should worship on a certain day of the week, it is to honor the Lord that they worship on that day. And as for those who think that it is all right to eat all kinds of food, it is to honor the Lord that they eat those foods, because they thank God for their food. As for those who abstain from eating certain kinds of food, it is to honor the Lord that they do not eat those foods, and they also thank God for the food that they do eat. So these people are not wrong, even though they think differently.

\v 5 One person values one day above another. Another values every day equally. Let each person be convinced in his own mind.
\v 6 He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord; and he who eats, eats for the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He who does not eat, refrains from eating for the Lord. He also gives thanks to God.
