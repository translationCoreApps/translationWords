====== 1 Corinthians 03:1-2 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 My fellow believers, \add when I was with you previously\add*, I was not able to teach you as \add I would teach people who are controlled by the Holy\add* Spirit \f + \ft Or:\add whom the Holy\add* Spirit\add controls\add* \f*. Instead, \add I had to teach you as I would teach\add* people whom their self-directed nature controls. \add I taught very simple concepts to you who had recently believed\add* in Christ, \add as a parent would speak very simple words\add* to a baby.
\v 2 I did not \add teach\add* you \add things that were difficult for you to understand, just like a woman does not\add* give \add her baby\add* solid food \add that the baby cannot chew and digest\add*. \add And just like a woman\add* \add gives her baby milk\f + \ft Or: breast-feeds her baby\add* \f*\add , I taught you simple spiritual concepts\add*, because at that time you were not able to understand difficult things. And you are still not able to understand difficult concepts,
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 My brothers and sisters, when I was with you, you were not ready to hear the difficult truths about God. I could speak to you only as if you were little children who are joined to Christ.
\v 2 I taught you things that were easy to understand, as a mother feeds milk to her babies. You were not ready for solid food. And even now, you are not ready.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\c 3
\p
\v 1 And I, brothers, could not speak to you as spiritual people, but instead as to fleshly people, as to babes in Christ.
\v 2 I fed you milk and not meat, for you were not ready for meat. And even now you are not ready.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul now reminds the Corinthian believers of how they are actually living instead of behaving as their position before God is. He then reminds them that the person who teaches them is not as important as God who gives their growth.

  * **brothers** - Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.
  * **spiritual people** - people who obey the Spirit
  * **fleshly people** - people who follow their own desires
  * **as to babes in Christ** - The Corinthians are compared to children very young in age and understanding. AT: "as to very young believers in Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I fed you milk and not meat** - The Corinthians can understand only easy truths like babies who can drink only milk. They are not mature enough to understand greater truths like older children who now can eat solid food. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you are not ready** - "you are not ready to understand the harder teachings about following Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
