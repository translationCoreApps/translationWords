===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Make two silver trumpets** - This means that Yahweh was commanding Moses to have the trumpet made, not that he personally had to make them. AT: "Tell someone to make two silver trumpets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **You must use the trumpets** - Moses will not personally blow the trumpets, rather he will command the priests to blow them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
