\v 21 After Jesus took the disciples and left the district of Galilee, they all went toward the region where the cities of Tyre and Sidon are located.
\v 22 A woman from the group of people called Canaanites who live in that region came to Jesus. She kept shouting to him, "Lord, you are the descendant of King David, you are the Messiah! Have pity on me and my daughter! She is suffering very much because a demon controls her."
\v 23 But Jesus did not answer her at all. The disciples said to him, "Tell her to leave because she keeps bothering us by shouting behind us as we go along."

\v 21 Then Jesus went away from there and withdrew toward the regions of the cities of Tyre and Sidon.
\v 22 And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from that region. She shouted out and said, "Have mercy on me, Lord, son of David; my daughter is very tormented by a demon."
\v 23 But Jesus answered her not a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away, for she is shouting after us."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This begins an account of Jesus healing the daughter of a Canaanite woman.

  * **Jesus went away** - It is implied that the disciples went with Jesus. AT: "Jesus and his disciples went away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **behold, a Canaanite woman came** - The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. AT: "there was a Canaanite woman who came"
  * **a Canaanite woman came out from that region** - "a woman from the group of people called Canaanites who live in that region" (UDB). The country of Canaan no longer existed by this time. She was a part of a people group that lived near the cities of Tyre and Sidon.
  * **Have mercy on me** - This phrase implies that she is requesting that Jesus heal her daughter. AT: "Have mercy and heal my daughter" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **son of David** - Jesus was not David's literal son, so this may be translated as "Descendant of David" (UDB). However, "Son of David" is also a title for the Messiah, and the woman may have been calling Jesus by this title.
  * **my daughter is very tormented by a demon** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "a demon is tormenting my daughter very much" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **answered her not a word** - Here "word" refers to what a person says. AT: "said nothing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
