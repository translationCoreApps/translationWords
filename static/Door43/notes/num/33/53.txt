<usfm>
\v 53 You must take possession of the land and settle in it, because I have given you the land to possess.
\v 54 You must inherit the land by lot, according to each clan. To the larger clans you must give a larger share of land, and to the smaller clans you must give a smaller share of land. Wherever the lot falls to each clan, that land will belong to it. You will inherit the land according to your ancestors' tribes.
