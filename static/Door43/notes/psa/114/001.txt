  * **When Israel left Egypt, the house of Jacob from that foreign people** - These two lines are parallel, with "Israel" and "the house of Jacob" meaning the same thing and "Egypt" and "that foreign people" referring to the same people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the house of Jacob from that foreign people** - The word "house" here represents the family or descendents. The verb may be supplied to this phrase.
