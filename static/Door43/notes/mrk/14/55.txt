===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a shift in the storyline as the author continues telling us about Jesus being put on trial.
  * **they might put him to death** - They were not the ones who would execute Jesus; rather, they would order someone else to do it. AT: "they might have Jesus executed" or "they might have someone execute Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **But they did not find any** - They did not find testimony against Jesus with which they could convict him and have him put to death. AT: "But they did not find any testimony with which to convict him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **brought false testimony against him** - Here speaking false testimony is described as if it were a physical object that someone can carry. AT: "accused him by speaking false testimony against him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their testimony did not agree** - This can be written in positive form. "but their testimony contradicted each other"
