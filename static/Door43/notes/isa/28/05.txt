===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh of hosts** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].
  * **will become a beautiful crown and a diadem of beauty** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. "Crown" refers to the blessing that God gives to his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **a spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "justice" is expressed as the verb "be just." AT: "Yahweh will cause the judges to be just" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **sits in judgment** - AT: "has the authority to judge" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **and strength for those who turn back their enemies at their gates** - "and Yahweh will cause the soldiers of the city to be strong"
