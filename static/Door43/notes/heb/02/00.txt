====== Hebrews 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is about how Jesus is better than Moses, the great Jew.

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:6-8, 12-13, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Brothers ==
The author probably uses the term "brothers" to refer to fellow Israelites and fellow Christians. Extra care should be taken to make sure the reference is clear. It may also be necessary to occasionally leave the referent vague. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Prophecy ==
Jesus literally fulfilled these prophecies about the Messiah but the prophecies themselves often contain poetic or metaphorical language. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:christ]], and [[:en:ta::vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
