====== Luke 03:8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Do the deeds that are appropriate for people who have truly turned from their sinful behavior! \add God promised to give Abraham many\add* descendants. In order to fulfill that promise, God does not need you! I tell you that he can change these stones to make them descendants of Abraham! So do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are descendants of Abraham, \add so God will not punish us, even though we have\add* sinned!'
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Do the things that show that you have truly turned away from your sinful behavior! And do not start saying to yourself, 'We are descendants of Abraham!' Because I tell you that God could make even these stones become descendants of Abraham!
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Therefore, produce fruits that are worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **produce fruits that are worthy of repentance** - In this metaphor, a person's behavior is compared to fruit. Just as a plant is expected to produce fruit that is appropriate for that kind of plant, a person who says that he has repented is expected to live righteously. AT: "produce the kind of fruit that shows that you have repented" or "do the good things that show that you have turned away from your sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to say within yourselves** - "saying to yourselves" or "thinking"
  * **We have Abraham for our father** - "Abraham is our ancestor" or "We are Abraham's descendants." If it is unclear why they would say this, you may also add the implied information: "so God will not punish us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **raise up children for Abraham** - This idiom means "create children for Abraham" or "cause people to become descendants of Abraham."
  * **from these stones** - John was probably referring to the actual stones along the Jordan River.
