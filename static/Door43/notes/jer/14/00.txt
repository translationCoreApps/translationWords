====== Jeremiah 14 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===
Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 14:1-10, 17-22, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== False prophets ==

The false prophets promised there would not be any war or drought. They gave people a false sense of hope, when they needed to repent. Because of this, Yahweh sent a drought and said that the false prophets would die of drought and war. This showed that these were not true prophets of Yahweh.  (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:promise]], [[:en:obe:kt:hope]] and [[:en:obe:kt:repent]])
