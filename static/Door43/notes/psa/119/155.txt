===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Salvation is far from the wicked** - The psalmist speaks of salvation as if it were a physical object. The abstract noun "salvation" can be translated using the verb "save." AT: "You will certainly not save the wicked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Great are your merciful actions** - "You have shown mercy to people many times" or "You have done many merciful things"
  * **as you always do** - Another possible meaning is "because you do what is just."
