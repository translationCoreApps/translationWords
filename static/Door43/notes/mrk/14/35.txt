===== translationNotes: =====

  * **if it were possible** - This means that if God would allow it to happen. AT: "if God would allow it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **this hour might pass** - Here "this hour" refers to Jesus' time of suffering, both now in the garden and later. AT: "that he would not have to go through this time of suffering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Abba** - "Abba" is a Greek term used by children to address their father. It implies a close relationship. Since it is followed by "Father," it is best to keep the Greek term "Abba" as is in your language. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **Remove this cup from me** - Jesus speaks of the suffering that he must endure as if it were a cup. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **But not my will, but yours** - Jesus is asking God to do what he wants to be done and not what Jesus wants. AT: "But do not do what I want, do what you want" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
