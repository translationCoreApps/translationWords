\v 31 But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying,
\v 32 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
\v 33 When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.
