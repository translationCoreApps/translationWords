\v 28 But when David's oldest brother Eliab heard David talking to the men, he was angry. He said to David, "Why have you come down here? Is someone taking care of those few sheep that you left in the desert? I know you are just a smart-aleck\f + \ft Or: brat \f*! You just want to watch the battle!"
\p
\v 29 David replied, "Have I done something wrong? I was merely asking a question!"
\v 30 Then he walked over to another man and asked him the same question, but the man gave him the same answer. Each time he asked someone, he received the same answer.

\v 28 Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, "Why did you come down here? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the mischief in your heart; for you have come down here so that you might see the battle."
\v 29 David said, "What have I done now? Was it not just a question?"
\v 30 He turned away from him toward another, and spoke in the same way. The people answered the same thing as before.
