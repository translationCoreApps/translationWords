====== Acts 28:28 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 28-29 \add That is what God said to the prophet Isaiah about our ancestors. But you Jews today do not want to believe God's message\add*. Therefore, I am telling you that \add God\add* has sent to the non-Jews this message about how he saves people, and they will listen \add and accept it\add*!"
\p
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 Therefore, you should know that God is offering to save the non-Jews, and they will listen."
\v 29 \f + \ft Acts 28:29 - the oldest and most accurate ancient copies of the book of Acts do not include the additional words found in Acts 28:29; and for that reason they are not included here. \f*

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 Therefore, you should know that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen."
\v 29 \f + \ft Acts 28:29 - the best ancient copies omit vs. 29, \fqa When he had said these things, the Jews went away. They were having a great dispute among themselves. \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul finishes speaking to the Jewish leaders in Rome.

  * **this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles** - God's message about how he saves people is spoken of as if it were an object that is sent. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God is sending his messengers to the Gentiles to tell them about how he will save them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they will listen** - "some of them will listen." This response of the Gentiles is in contrast to the way the Jews of that time responded.
