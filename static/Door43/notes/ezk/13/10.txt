\v 10 They deceive my people, saying "Things will go well for us" when things will not go well. It is like they want to make people think that there is a very strong wall when it is not strong.
\v 11 So, tell those prophets who cover the wall with whitewash that the wall will surely fall down. It will rain very hard. I will send big hailstones to fall. Very strong winds will blow against it.
\v 12 When the wall falls down, the people will certainly say to those prophets, "The white paint certainly did not make the wall strong!"

<usfm>
\v 10 Because of this, and because they led my people astray and said, "Peace!" when there is no peace, they are building a wall that they will paint with whitewash.'
\v 11 Say to those who are whitewashing the wall, 'It will fall down; there will be a downpour of rain, and I will send hailstones to make it fall down, and a windstorm wind to break it down.
\v 12 See, the wall will fall down. Have others not said to you, "Where is the whitewash that you put on it?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In these verses, Yahweh speaks of the false security that the prophets have given to the people by speaking of peace as if the prophets had build a poorly-constructed wall and covered it over with white paint in order to make it look good. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **Because of this** - The word "this" refers to the prophets reporting false visions to the people and telling them lies.
  * **they led my people astray** - Yahweh speaks of the prophets deceiving the people and getting them to believe lies as if the prophets had led the people away from the path upon which they should have been walking. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **they are building a wall that they will paint with whitewash** - Here "a wall" stands for peace and security that the false prophets told the people that Yahweh was promising to give them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **whitewash ... whitewashing** - The word "whitewash" refers to a white liquid mixture or paint used to cover up impurities and make surfaces white.
  * **I will send hailstones to make it fall down, and a windstorm wind to break it down** - Yahweh refers to the judgment that he will send upon the people as if it were a severe storm that breaks down the wall. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **hailstones** - balls of ice that sometimes falls from the sky during a rainstorm.
  * **Have others not said to you, "Where is the whitewash that you put on it?"** - Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that others will ask the prophets what happened the their whitewash. AT: "Others will certainly say to you, 'Where is the whitewash that you put on it?'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Where is the whitewash that you put on it?** - Possible meanings are 1) that this is an honest question for which the people expect and answer or 2) this is a rhetorical question that the people ask out of sarcasm. AT: "The whitewash that you put on it did not good." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
