===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice** - Possible meanings are 1) that the psalmist speaks as if "the heavens" and "the earth" have emotions like people. "Let it be as if the heavens are glad and the earth rejoices" or 2) "Let those who live in the heavens be glad and let those who live on the earth rejoice" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **let the sea roar and that which fills it shout with joy** - "let the sea sound like many people praising Yahweh, and let it be as if those who live in the sea are shouting for joy"
  * **Let the fields rejoice and all that is in them** - "Let the fields and all that is in them rejoice." The psalmist speaks as if "the fields" and the animals that live in them have emotions like people. AT: "Let it be as if the fields themselves and all the animals that live in them are rejoicing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Then let all the trees in the forest shout** - "Then all the trees in the forest will shout" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world ... and the peoples** - The three phrase have similar meanings; the last two phases are used to strengthen the first. (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **to judge ... will judge** - Another possible meaning is "to rule ... will rule."
  * **He will judge the world with righteousness** - Here "the world" is a metonym for all the people in the world. AT: "He will judge all the people of the world righteously." See how these words are translated in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:009:007|9:8]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the peoples with his faithfulness** - "he will judge the peoples with his faithfulness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **with his faithfulness** - Possible meanings are 1) "fairly, according to what he knows is true" or 2) "using the same standard for all people."
