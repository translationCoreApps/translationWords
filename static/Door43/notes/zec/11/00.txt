====== Zechariah 11 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter unlike the previous one is a warning against the leaders amongst the exiles.

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 11:1-3,17, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===



=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
This chapter uses an extended metaphor of sheep and shepherds to convey Yahweh's dismay at the leaders during the exiles. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

== Symbolism ==
The writer uses symbolism. The Zechariah is told to become a shepherd and he uses two staffs and names them "Unity" and "Favor." He does this very purposefully. In order to preserve this symbolism, it is important to pay attention the specific words used. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:favor]])
