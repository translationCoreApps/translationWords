\v 27 It is not at all because we obey the laws of Moses that God erases the record of our sins. So there is no way that we can boast that God favors us because we obeyed those laws. Instead, it is because we believe in Christ that God erases the record of our sins.
\v 28 So it is clear that God makes someone right with himself if that person trusts in Christâ€”not if that person obeys the law.

\v 27 Where then is boasting? It is excluded. On what grounds? Of works? No, but on the grounds of faith.
\v 28 We conclude then that a person is justified by faith without works of the law.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Where then is boasting? It is excluded** - Paul asks this question to show that there is no reason for people to boast about obeying the law. AT: "So there is no way that we can boast that God favors us because we obeyed those laws. Boasting is excluded" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **On what grounds? Of works? No, but on the grounds of faith** - Paul asks and answers these  rhetorical questions to emphasize that each point he is making is certainly true. You can translate this by including the words that Paul implies, and by using an active form. AT: "On what grounds should we exclude boasting? Should we exclude it because of our good works? No, rather, we should exclude it because of faith" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **without** - "apart from" or "with no consideration for"
