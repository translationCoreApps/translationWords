\v 9 Then I saw four wheels alongside the winged creatures. There was one wheel beside each of the winged creatures. The wheels shone like \f + \ft simile \f* very valuable stones.
\v 10 The wheels were all alike: Each had one wheel inside another wheel.
\v 11 Whenever they moved, they went straight in whatever direction one of the winged creatures faced. The wheels did not turn in another direction while the winged creatures flew.

\v 9 So I looked, and behold! Four wheels were beside the cherubim—one wheel beside each cherub—and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.
\v 10 Their appearance was the same likeness for all four of them, like a wheel intersecting another wheel.
\v 11 When they moved, they went in any of the four directions without turning in any other direction. Instead, wherever the head was facing, they followed it. They did not turn in any other direction as they went.
