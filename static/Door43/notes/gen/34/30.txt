===== translationNotes: =====

  * **brought trouble on me** - Causing someone to experience trouble is spoken of as if trouble were an object that is brought and placed on a person. AT: "caused great problems for me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to make me stink to the inhabitants of the land** - Causing the people in the surrounding areas to hate Jacob is spoken of as if Jacob's sons made him smell bad physically. This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "You have made me repulsive to the people who live in the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I am few in number ... against me and attack me, then I will be destroyed, I and my household** - Here the words "I" and "me" refer to all of Jacob's household. Jacob only says "I" or "me" since he is the leader. AT: "My household is small ... against us and attack us, then they will destroy all of us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **gather themselves together against me and attack me** - "form an army and attack me" or "form an army and attack us"
  * **then I will be destroyed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "they will destroy me" or "they will destroy us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Should Shechem have dealt with our sister as with a prostitute?** - Simeon and Levi use a question to emphasize that Shechem did what was wrong and deserved to die. AT: "Shechem should not have treated our sister as if she were a prostitute!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
