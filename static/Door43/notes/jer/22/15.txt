\v 15 Is this what makes you a good king, that you wanted to have boards of cedar?
\q Did not your father also eat and drink, yet do justice and righteousness? Then things went well for him.
\q
\v 16 He judged in favor of the poor and needy. It was good then. Is this not what it means to know me?â€”this is Yahweh's declaration.
