===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Because the Spirit has enabled them to love others, Paul prays for them and tells them here how he prays for them.

  * **Because of this love** - "Because the Holy Spirit has enabled you to love other believers"
  * **we heard ... we have not stopped ... We have been asking ... We have been praying** - These words do not include the Colossians. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **from the day we heard this** - "from the day Epaphras told us these things"
  * **that you will be filled with the knowledge of his will** - Paul speaks of the Colossian believers as though they were containers. AT: "that God will fill you with what you need to know so that you can do his will" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in all wisdom and spiritual understanding** - ", so that the Holy Spirit will make you wise and able to understand what God wants you to do"
  * **that you will walk worthily of the Lord** - Walking here signifies behavior in life. AT: "that you will live the way God expects you to" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **in pleasing ways** - "in ways that will please the Lord"
  * **will bear fruit** - Paul is speaking of the Colossian believers as if they were trees or plants. As a plant grows and bears fruit, so also believers are to keep getting to know God better and doing good deeds. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
