\v 6 You also know that there is something that is preventing this man from showing himself to everybody now. He will not be able to show himself until the time that God will allow him to.
\v 7 Although Satan is already secretly causing people to reject God's laws, the one who is preventing this man from revealing himself now will continue to prevent him until God removes him.

\v 5 Do you not remember that when I was with you I told you these things?
\v 6 Now you know what restrains him, so that he will be revealed only at the right time.
\v 7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already working, only there is someone who restrains him now until he is taken out of the way.
