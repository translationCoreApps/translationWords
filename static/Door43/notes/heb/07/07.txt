\v 7 We know for certain that it is the more \add important people\add* who \add ask God to\add* bless the less important people. \add And Melchizedek blessed Abraham. So we conclude that Melchizedek was greater than Abraham\add*.
\v 8 In the case of \add the priests who are descendants of Levi\add*, men who some day will die receive tithes. But in the case of \add Melchizedek it is as if God\add* testifies that he was still living, \add since there is no record in Scriptures about his death\add*.
\v 9 And it was as though Levi himself, and \add all the priests descended from him\add*—who received tithes \add from the people\add*—paid tithes \add to Melchizedek\add*. And when Abraham paid tithes, it \add was as though Levi and all the priests descended from him acknowledged that the work Melchizedek did as a priest was greater than the work Levi did\add*,
\v 10 since \add the sperm from which all those priests were eventually born\add* was still in Abraham's body \f + \ft euphemism \f* when Melchizedek met Abraham.

\v 7 Now everyone knows that the more important people bless the less important people, just as Melchizedek blessed Abraham. So we know that Melchizedek was greater than Abraham.
\v 8 In the case of the priests who are descendants of Levi, they are all men who will die one day, but even they received tithes. However, in the case of Melchizedek, who received a tenth of everything from Abraham—it is as if God testified that Melchizedek keeps on living, since scripture does not speak about him dying.
\v 9 And it was as though Levi himself, and all the priests descended from him—those who received tithes from the people—paid tithes to Melchizedek because their ancestor Abraham paid tithes to him. When Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek it was as though Levi and all the priests descended from him acknowledged that Melchizedek was greater Abraham.
\v 10 This is true because we can say that Levi and his descendants were still in Abraham's body when Melchizedek met Abraham.

\v 7 There is no denying that the lesser person is blessed by the greater person.
\v 8 In this case, mortal men receive tithes, but in that case it is testified that he lives on.
\v 9 And, in a manner of speaking, Levi, who received tithes, also paid tithes through Abraham,
\v 10 because Levi was in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met Abraham.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the lesser person is blessed by the greater person** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the more important person blesses the less important person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **In this case ... in that case** - These phrases are used to compare the Levite priests with Melchizedek. Your language may have a way to emphasize that the author is making a comparison.
  * **is testified that he lives on** - It is never explicitly written in scripture that Melchizedek dies. The author of Hebrews speaks of this absence of information about Melchizedek's death in scripture as if it were a positive statement that he is still alive. This can be stated in active form. AT: "scripture shows that he lives on"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Levi ... was in the body of his ancestor** - Since Levi had not been born yet, the author speaks of him as still being in Abraham's body. In this way, the author argues that Levi paid tithes to Melchizedek through Abraham. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
