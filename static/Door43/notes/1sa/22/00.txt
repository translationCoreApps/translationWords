====== 1 Samuel 22 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

There are two stories in this chapter: David gathering a group of followers and Saul having all the priests and their families killed. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:priest]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== David assembles a force of unhappy people ==
David hides in the wilderness, and people in trouble come to him. Soon he has a force of 500 men. The prophet then tells him to leave the wilderness. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

== Saul and the chief priest's family ==
Doeg tells Saul that Ahimelech the priest gave David food and a sword and prayed for him. Saul accuses the priests of encouraging David to rebel. This is a serious accusation because the priests are God's representatives and are rebelling against God's king if the accusation is true. Saul has the priests and all their families killed except those who escape to David. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:highpriest]])
