===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my people** - Here "my" refers to Isaiah. Also "people" refers to the people of Israel.
  * **until the indignation has passed by** - Translate the abstract noun "indignation" as the adjective "angry." AT: "until Yahweh is no longer angry with us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]]) 
  * **the earth will uncover her bloodshed, and will no longer conceal her slain** - Yahweh revealing all murders that have happened on the earth so that he can punish the murderers is spoken of as if the earth itself will reveal everyone who has been murdered. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
