===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - David's song to Yahweh continues. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Then the earth shook ... were ignited by it** - This is Yahweh's response to David's cry for help from his enemies. David uses the imagery of the earth shaking and fire coming from Yahweh to emphasize Yahweh's terrible anger. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and were shaken, because God was angry** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "because God's anger shook them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Coals were ignited by it** - Here Yahweh's anger is compared to fire, which causes coals to ignite and burn. AT: "The flame from his mouth set coals on fire" or "He also sent burning coals from his mouth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
