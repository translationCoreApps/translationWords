\v 12 But those \add of us who welcomed him, God\add* authorized \add that we would have a relationship with\add* him \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like\add* children \add have a relationship with their father\add*. We were people who believed \add that what he said\add* about himself \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add was true\add*.
\v 13 We became \add like God's children\add*, not because our ancestors \add belonged to God\add*, or because of someone's sexual desires, nor because some man desired to have children like himself. Instead, we were caused by God \f + \ft Or:God caused us \f* to become \add like\add* his children.

<usfm>
\v 12 But all who took him into their lives and trusted in him, to them he gave the right to become God's children.
\v 13 These are children born from God. They were not born by means of a normal human birth nor out of a human desire or choice nor because of a husband's desire to become a father.

\v 12 But to as many as received him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.
\v 13 These were not born of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
