\v 1 Now, Festus entered the province, and after three days, he went from Caesarea up to Jerusalem.
\v 2 The chief priest and the prominent Jews brought accusations against Paul, and they urged him  
\v 3 and asked him for a favor that would put Paul in dangerâ€”that Festus might summon Paul to Jerusalem so that they could kill him along the way.
