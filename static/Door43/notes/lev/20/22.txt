===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the land into which I am bringing you to live will not vomit you up** - This phrase describes the land as a vomiting person who needs to reject bad food. Instead of rejecting bad food, the land rejects the people and removes them. See how you translated this metaphor in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:18:24|18:25]]. AT: "the land to which I am bringing you will not reject you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **You must not walk in** - Doing the actions of idol worshipers is spoken of as walking in their ways. AT: "you must not follow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **drive out** - "remove"
