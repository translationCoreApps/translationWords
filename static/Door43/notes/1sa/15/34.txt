===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Ramah ... Gibeah** - These are the names of places. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names ]])
  * **went up to his house at Gibeah** - Gibeah was higher in elevation than Gilgal where Saul and Samuel had been talking.
  * **Samuel did not see Saul until the day of his death** - This statement is very precise and should be translated carefully. Samuel died before Saul and did not see Saul again while he lived. However, Samuel did appear to Saul in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:28:11|28:11-19]] after Samuel died.
