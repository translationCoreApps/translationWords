====== 1 Corinthians 02:1-2 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 My fellow believers, when I came to you, I proclaimed to you the message that God had revealed to me. But I did not proclaim it using eloquent words that would make people think highly of me, nor did I argue in a way that unbelievers would think was very wise.
\v 2 I did that because I decided that I would speak only about Jesus Christ. Specifically, I told you  \add what he accomplished for us when\add* he was killed by being nailed \f + \ft Or:\add when they\add* killed him by nailing him \f* to a cross.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not make beautiful speeches, nor did I repeat to you the things that wise men said. I told you the hidden truths about God.
\v 2 I decided not to talk to you about anything other than Jesus Christ and his death on the cross.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

\c 2
\p
\v 1 When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence of speech or wisdom as I proclaimed hidden truths about God.
\f + \ft Many other versions read, \fqa as I proclaimed the testimony about God. \f*
\v 2 For I decided to know nothing when I was among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
