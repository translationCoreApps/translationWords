<usfm>
\v 1 \add It seems that\add* it is necessary for me to go on boasting \add about myself\add*. Although \add I do\add* not \add think that my telling you about\add* this will help \add you to accept me as Christ's representative to you\add*, I \add will say this anyway\add*. I will tell you about visions that the Lord \add gave a certain man\add* and about things that he \add supernaturally\add* revealed \add to that man. I will tell you this because some of the people among you boast that it was in visions that they received the things that they teach\add*.
\v 2 The man that I will tell you about is one \add who believes\add* in Christ. Fourteen years ago he was taken \f + \ft Or:\add Christ\add* took him \f* up into the highest heaven, \add the place where God is\add*. I do not know whether he went there \add in his physical body\add* or whether he was outside of his body \add at that time and only his spirit went\add*. Only God really knows.

\v 1 Even though it does no good, I must continue to defend myself, so I will continue by boasting about some visions that the Lord gave me.
\v 2 Fourteen years ago God took me, a man who is joined to Christ, up to the highest heaven—although only God knows whether he took me up only in my spirit or in my body, too.

\v 1 I must boast, but nothing is gained by it. But I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.
\v 2 I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago who—whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know, God knows—was caught up into the third heaven.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - In defending his apostleship from God, Paul continues to state specific things that have happened to him since he became a believer.

  * **I will go on to** - "I will continue talking, but now about"
  * **visions and revelations from the Lord** - Possible meanings are 1) Paul uses the words "visions" and "revelations" to mean the same thing in hendiadys for emphasis. AT: "things that the Lord has allowed only me to see" or 2) Paul is speaking of two different things. AT: "secret things that the Lord has let me see with my eyes and other secrets that he has told me about" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
  * **I know a man in Christ** - Paul is actually speaking of himself as if he were speaking of someone else, but this should be translated literally if possible.
  * **whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know** - Paul continues to describe himself as if this happened to another person. "I do not know if this man was in his physical body or in his spiritual body"
  * **God knows** - "only God knows"
  * **the third heaven** - This refers to the dwelling place of God rather than the sky or outer space (the planets, stars, and the universe).
