\v 25 For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of this mystery, in order that you will not be wise in your own thinking. This mystery is that a partial hardening has occurred in Israel, until the completion of the Gentiles come in.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I do not want you to be unaware** - Here Paul uses a double negative. You can translate this in a positive form. AT: "I very much want you to be aware" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **brothers** - Here "brothers" means fellow Christians, including both men and women.
  * **I** - The pronoun "I" refers to Paul.
  * **you ... you ... your** - The pronouns "you" and "your" refer to the Gentile believers.
  * **in order that you will not be wise in your own thinking** - Paul does not want the Gentile believers to think they are wiser than the Jewish unbelievers. AT: "so that you will not think you are wiser than you are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a partial hardening has occurred in Israel** - Paul speaks of "hardening" or stubbornness as if it were a hardening of physical organs in the body. Some Jews have refused to accept salvation through Jesus. AT: "many people of Israel continue to be stubborn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **until the completion of the Gentiles come in** - The word "until" here implies that some Jews will believe after God has finished bringing the Gentiles into the church.
