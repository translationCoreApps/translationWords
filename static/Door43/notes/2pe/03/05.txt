\v 5 They will say this because they deliberately overlook the fact that God, by commanding long ago that it should be so, caused the heavens to exist, and he caused the earth to come up out of water and to be separate from the water.
\v 6 And God, by commanding that it should be so, later destroyed the world that existed at that time, by causing the earth to be flooded with water.
\v 7 Furthermore, God, by commanding that it should be so, has set apart the heavens and the earth that exist now, and they are being kept until the time when he will judge ungodly people. And at that time he will destroy the heavens and the earth by burning them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 They willfully forget that the heavens and the earth came to exist out of water and through water, long ago, by God's command,
\v 6 and that through these things, the world of that time was destroyed, being flooded with water.
\v 7 But now the heavens and the earth are reserved for fire by that same command. They are reserved for the day of judgment and the destruction of the ungodly people.
