===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Your righteousness also, God, is very high** - The psalmist speaks of the good things God has done as though they were put together as a high building or a mountain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who is like you?** - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "there is no one like you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **severe troubles** - "horrible troubles"
  * **revive** - strengthen or make lively again
  * **from the depths of the earth** - "The depths of the earth" is a metaphor for where people go when they die. The psalmist had not already died, but he speaks as if he had. AT: "when we are near death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
