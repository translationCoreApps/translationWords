\v 14 Remember, the body is not just one part, but many parts work together to make up the entire body.
\v 15 If your foot spoke to you and said, "I am not the hand, therefore, I am not part of your body," it would not be less a part of your body because it was not like your hand.
\v 16 And if your ear said to you, "I am not an eye. For that reason, I have no place in the body," it would not be less a part of your body because it was not an eye.
\v 17 If your whole body were an eye, there would be nothing with which to hear. If your whole body were an ear, there would be nothing with which to smell.

\v 14 For the body is not a single member, but many.
\v 15 If the foot says, "Since I am not the hand, I am not part of the body," it is not any less a part of the body.
\v 16 And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I am not part of the body," it is not any less a part of the body.
\v 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
