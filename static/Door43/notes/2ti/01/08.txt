\v 8 So never be ashamed\f + \ft Or: reluctant \f* to tell others the message about our Lord. And do not \add be ashamed\add* of me, \add even though I am\add* a prisoner \add because I preach about\add* him. Instead, \add be willing to\add* suffer as I do as you proclaim the message about Christ. \add Endure what you will suffer\add* by letting God empower \add you to endure it\add*.
\v 9 \add God\add* saved us and chose us to conduct our lives in a pure way. It was not our doing good deeds\f + \ft Or: actions \f* \add that caused him to do this for usâ€”something\add* that we did not deserve. Instead, before time began\f + \ft Or: he created the world \f* he purposed, Or: planned to \add be kind to us\add* as a result of what Christ Jesus \add would do for us\add*.
\v 10 Now, as a result of our Savior Christ Jesus having come, it has been revealed \f + \ft Or:he has shown \f* \add that he acts kindly toward us. Specifically, Christ Jesus\add* has declared that we \add will not remain dead after we\add* die! He has also revealed that, as a result of \add our hearing and accepting\add* the message \add about Christ, we\add* will live \add forever in bodies that will\add* not decay!
\v 11 I was chosen \f + \ft Or:Christ chose me \f* to go as an apostle to many places and proclaim that message to people.

\v 8 So do not think that you will have shame if you tell others about our Lord Jesus. And do not think you will have shame if you are my friend, because I am in prison because I trust in Jesus. Instead, be willing to suffer hardship as you tell others about the good news. God will make you able to suffer all hardships.
\v 9 He will do this because he saved us and called us to be his own people. God did not save us because of any good works we did; instead, he saved us because he planned to give us this gift! God caused the Messiah Jesus to pass this gift to us, even before the world began.
\v 10 Now everyone can see that God can save them, because our Savior the Messiah Jesus came and destroyed death and showed everyone the Gospel, the truth that he causes people to live forever.
\v 11 It was for this reason that God decided to send me to be an apostle, preacher, and teacher.

\v 8 So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me, Paul, his prisoner. Instead, share in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God.
\v 9 It is God who saved us and called us with a holy calling. He did this, not according to our works, but according to his own plan and grace. He gave us these things in Christ Jesus before times ever began.
\v 10 But now God's salvation has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus. It is Christ who put an end to death and brought life that never ends to light through the gospel.
\v 11 Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher.
