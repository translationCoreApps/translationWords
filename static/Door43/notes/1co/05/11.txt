====== 1 Corinthians 05:11-13 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 But now  \add I am stating clearly that\add* when I wrote, I  \add meant that\add* you should not associate with those who say that they are fellow believers, if they are sexually immoral or if they desire and forcefully seize things that belong to others, or worship idols, or slander others, or become drunk. You should not associate with people like that, and you should not even eat with them!
\v 12 It is certainly not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* my business to judge people who are not believers and who do not belong to  \add Christian congregations\add*. But it certainly is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* your business to judge those who are in  \add your congregation\add*.
\v 13 God is the one who will judge those who are not believers\add . Do as the Scriptures command:\add*  "Expel the wicked person from your midst!"

\v 11 Instead, I mean that you are not to be close friends with a fellow believer who is living in sexual immorality. We must include other sins, such as greed, or idolatry, or one who is abusive in the way he talks to others, or a drunkard, or a swindler. You must not even eat with these people who claim to trust in Christ, yet they do these terrible things.
\v 12 For I have no obligation to judge those who are outside the church of Christ. Your duty is to judge those who are in it.
\v 13 God is the one who will judge those who are outside the church. The scriptures command us, 
\q "You must take away the evil person who is among you!"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother but who is living in sexual immorality, or who is greedy, or is an idolater, or is verbally abusive, or is a drunkard, or a swindler. Do not even eat a meal with such a person.
\v 12 For how am I involved with judging those who are outside the church? Instead, are you not to judge those who are inside the church?
\v 13 But God judges those who are on the outside. 
\q "Remove the evil person from among you."
