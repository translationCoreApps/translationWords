====== Exodus 29 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Consecrating priests ==
This chapter records the process of consecrating priests. The priests were to be set apart from the rest of Israel because Yahweh is holy. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:consecrate]], [[:en:obe:kt:priest]] and [[:en:obe:kt:holy]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "I will live among the Israelites" ==
As God, Yahweh is everywhere and cannot be limited to a single space. This phrase indicates that he permanently remains within Israel in a special way while they have the ark.
