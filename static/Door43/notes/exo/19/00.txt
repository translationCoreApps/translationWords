====== Exodus 19 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "A kingdom of priests" ==
The function of the priests was to intercede for the people. The Levites were the only priests in Israel; this is a metaphor indicating that the nation was to intercede for the world as a whole. They were also to be holy, or set apart, from the rest of the world. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:priest]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:holy]])

== Revealing the Law ==
The events of this chapter are concerned with preparing the people to receive the law of Moses. The people go through all of this to prepare themselves for the law, which show the great importance of this event for Israel. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]])
