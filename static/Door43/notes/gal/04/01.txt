\v 1 Now, I will further discuss children and heirs. An heir is a son who will later possess all that his father has. But as long as that heir is a child, he is like a slave whom others control.
\v 2 Until the day that his father has previously determined, other persons supervise the child and manage his property.

\v 1 I am saying that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, though he is owner of the entire estate.
\v 2 But he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by his father.
