===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The part of the story from the previous chapter continues. Jesus reclines at the table with his disciples and continues to speak to them. 

  * **I am the true vine** - Here the "true vine" is a metaphor. Jesus compares himself to a vine or a vine stem. He is the source of life that causes people to live in a way that pleases God. AT: "I am like a vine that produces good fruit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my Father is the gardener** - The "gardener" is a metaphor. A "gardener" is a person who takes care of the vine to ensure it is as fruitful as possible. AT: "my Father is like a gardener" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit, and he prunes every branch that bears fruit so that it will bear more fruit** - Here the "branch" is a metaphor that represents each person who belongs to Jesus. God cares for them so that they will be able to live in a way that is pleasing to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **takes away** - "cuts off and takes away"
  * **prunes every branch** - "trims every branch"
