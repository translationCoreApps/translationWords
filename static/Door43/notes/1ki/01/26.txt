  * **General Information:** - Nathan the prophet continues to speak to King David.

  * **Has my master the king done this without telling us, your servants, who should sit on the throne after him?** - Nathan refers to David in the third person. This is a way of showing respect to the king. It can be stated in second person. AT: "Have you, my master the king, done this without telling us, your servants, who should sit on the throne after you?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **who should sit on the throne** - Sitting on the throne is a metonym for being king. Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:01:13|1:13]]. AT: "who would be king after him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
