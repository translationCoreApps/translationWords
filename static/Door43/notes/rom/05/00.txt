====== Romans 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Many scholars view 5:12-17 as some of the most important, but difficult, verses in Scripture to understand. Some of their richness and meaning has undoubtedly been lost in their translation from the original Greek construction.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Results of justification ==
A major aspect of this chapter involves Paul's explanation of the results of justification. These include: peace with God, access to God, confidence about our future destiny, an ability to rejoice in sufferings, eternal salvation and reconciliation with God. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:justify]])

== "All sinned" ==
Scholars are divided over how this worked. Some believe that all of mankind was present in the "seed of Adam," and as the father of all mankind, all of mankind was present when Adam sinned. Other believe Adam served as a representative head for mankind and when he sinned, all of mankind "fell" as a result. Whether people today played an active or passive role in Adam's original sin is one difference between these views. Other passages will help one to come to a conclusion regarding this issue. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:seed]], [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

== The second Adam ==
Adam was the first man and the first "son" of God. He was a creation of God and brought sin and death into the world by eating the forbidden fruit. Paul describes Jesus as the "second Adam" in this chapter and the true son of God. He brings life and overcomes sin and death by his death on the cross. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sonofgod]] and [[:en:obe:kt:death]])
