===== translationNotes: =====

  * **his separation** - - Here "separation" means "dedication." Also, this abstract noun may be written as a verb. AT: "his dedication" or "for having dedicated himself to Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Whatever else he may give** - This refers to the Nazirite deciding to give other offering beyond what he has been commanded to give. AT: "If he decides to give any additional offerings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **he must keep the obligations of the vow he has taken** - "he must still obey the requirements of the vow he has taken" 
  * **he must keep the obligations ... to keep the promise indicated by the law for the Nazirite** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined to emphasize that he must obey the obligations of his vow. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the promise indicated by the law for the Nazirite** - This can be stated in active form.  AT: "the promise that the law for the Nazirite indicates" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
