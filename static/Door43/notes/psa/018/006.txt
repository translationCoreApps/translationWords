  * **In my distress** - "In my great need" or "In my despair"
  * **my call for help went into his presence** - Here David speaks of his "call for help" as if it were a person who could come into the presence of Yahweh. AT: "I prayed to him" (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **it went into his ears** - Here David speaks of how Yahweh heard his cry for help. The idea is repeated for emphasis. AT: "he heard my appeal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
