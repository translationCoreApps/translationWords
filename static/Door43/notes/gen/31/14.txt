\v 14 Rachel and Leah replied to him, "Our father will not give us anything more when he dies \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
\v 15 He treats us as though we were foreigners \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! Your working for him all these years was like a payment that you gave him as a price for us, but we will not inherit any of that money that he got as a price for us. He has spent it all!
\v 16 Surely all of the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So do whatever God has told you to do!"

\v 14 Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, "Is there any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
\v 15 Are we not treated by him as foreigners? For he has sold us and has also completely devoured our money.
\v 16 For all the riches that God has taken away from our father are now ours and our children's. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do it."
