===== translationNotes: =====


  * **fir** - The word "fir" refers to many kinds of trees including Cypress trees.
  * **measures of wheat** - This was a dry measurement whereas the oil was a liquid measurement. It was not clear which measure was intended. The UDB takes an educated guess. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bvolume]])
  * **year by year** - "every year"
