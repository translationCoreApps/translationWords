\q2 they will cause those disasters to come onto themselves.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah has fallen** - Possible meanings are that Isaiah is speaking of 1) a future military invasion as if it were the past to emphasize that it will certainly happen AT: "God will cause people to destroy Jerusalem and Judah" (see UDB) or 2) the people as if their evil behavior had made them so drunk they could not stand. "For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The look on their faces witnesses against them** - "The prideful looks on their faces show that they oppose Yahweh"
  * **they tell of their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it** - Here God compares the people of Judah with the people of Sodom who were not ashamed of their sin. AT: "like the people of Sodom, they talk about their sins and let everyone see them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
