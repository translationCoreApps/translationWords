====== 2 Timothy 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The ULB has chosen to indent the lines of 2:11-13 to set it apart from the rest of the text as the "trustworthy saying." It is not necessary for translators to do this in their own versions, but they may find it helpful to do so.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== We will reign with him ==
The faithful Christian are said to reign with Christ in the future. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:faithful]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Analogies ==
Paul draws on several analogies in this chapter to present his teaching about living as a Christian. He presents a analogy first, of a soldier, then an athlete, and then a farmer. A little further on, he presents an analogy of different kinds of containers in a house, some for ordinary, everyday use, and some reserved for use on special occasions.
