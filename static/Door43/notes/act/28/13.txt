\v 13 Then we sailed and arrived at the city of Rhegium in Italy. The next day, the wind was blowing from the south, so in only two more days we reached the town of Puteoli. There we left the ship.
\v 14 In Puteoli we met some fellow believers who wanted us to stay with them for seven days. After this, we finally arrived at Rome.
\p
\v 15 In Rome, some fellow believers had heard about us, so they came to meet us. Some of them met us at the town called The Market on Appian Road, and others met us at the town called The Three Inns. When Paul saw those believers, he thanked God and was encouraged.

\v 13 From there we sailed and arrived at the city of Rhegium. After one day a south wind sprang up, and in two days we came to the city of Puteoli.
\v 14 There we found some brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. In this way we came to Rome.
\v 15 From there the brothers, after they heard about us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns. When Paul saw the brothers, he thanked God and took courage.
