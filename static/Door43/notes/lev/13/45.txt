\v 45 The person who has an infectious disease must wear torn clothes, his hair must hang loosely, and he must cover his face up to his nose and call out, 'Unclean, unclean.'
\v 46 All the days that he has the infectious disease he will be unclean. Because he is unclean with a disease that can spread, he must live alone. He must live outside the camp.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling Moses and Aaron what the people must do when someone has a skin disease.

  * **outside the camp** - The camp is the area where the majority of Israelites lived. The unclean person was not permitted to live among them because his disease may spread to others.
  * **Unclean, unclean** - The person whom other people must not touch is spoken of as if he were physically unclean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
