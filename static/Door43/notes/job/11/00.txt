=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

Zophar tells Job to curse Yahweh. The advice Zophar gives to Job is bad advice. He even questions the character of God. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:curse|curse, cursed]])

Zophar uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter in order to try to convince Job that he is wrong. These questions help to build Zophar's argument. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
