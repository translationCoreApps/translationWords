\q
\v 6 Will not all these create a saying to ridicule him and a taunting song about him, saying, 
\q 'Woe to the one increasing what is not his! For how long will you increase the weight of the pledges you have taken?'
\q2
\v 7 Will the ones gnashing at you not rise up suddenly, and the ones terrifying you awaken? 
\q2 You will become a victim for them!
\q2
\v 8 Because you have plundered many peoples, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you. 
\q2 For you have shed human blood and acted with violence against the land, the cities, and all who live in them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to answer Habakkuk. He refers to the Chaldeans as though they are one person.

  * **people** - The word "people" refers to the Israelites.
  * **For how long will you increase the weight of the pledges you have taken?** - "At some time you will no longer be able to take pledges from people." This can mean 1) the Chaldeans are like robbers who are carrying around pledges they have forced other people to sign or 2) Yahweh is keeping an account of what the Chaldeans have stolen and will someday require them to pay it back. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **pledges** - promise notes given for a debt that is owed, often written on clay
  * **Will the ones gnashing at you not rise up suddenly, and the ones terrifying you awaken** - This question was asked in order to make the Chaldeans think about the answer. "The ones who are angry at you will come against you, the ones you are afraid of will begin to attack" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **gnashing** - biting or pressing their teeth together to show anger or sorrow
  * **rise up** - "become more numerous" or "become more powerful"
  * **plundered** - stolen or taken by force.
