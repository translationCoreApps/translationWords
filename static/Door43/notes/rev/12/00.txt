====== Revelation 12 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 12:10-22, which are extended quotations.

Many scholars believe the events of this chapter are both future and past. The author may shift between the events without shifting the tense in which he speaks. Despite this, John speaks as if these events are about to happen.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Serpent ==
The reference to Satan as the serpent is intended to have the reader remember the account of the temptation in the Garden of Eden. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
The woman is described using many different metaphors. Her identity is unclear, but  this chapter is probably about the rise of the Antichrist. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:antichrist]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "A great sign was seen in heaven" ==
It is unclear whether this was seen by everybody on earth or whether it was only seen by John in his vision. The translator may have difficulty when the subject is unclear. In English, this is done through the use of the passive voice, but every language does not have this construct. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_apocalypticwriting]])
