===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking.

  * **I have kept quiet for a long time; I have been still and restrained myself** - These two lines share similar meanings. Yahweh's inactivity is described as quietness and stillness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I have been still and restrained myself** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and indicate that Yahweh has kept himself from acting. AT: "I have kept myself from doing anything" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **I will cry out like a woman in labor; I will gasp and pant** - Yahweh's activity as a shouting warrior is compared with a pregnant woman who cries from labor pains. This emphasizes sudden unavoidable action after a period of inactivity. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **I will lay waste mountains ... will dry up the marshes** - Yahweh uses this metaphorical language to describe his great power to conquer his enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
