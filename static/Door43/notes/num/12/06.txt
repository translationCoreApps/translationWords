\v 6 Yahweh said, "Now listen to my words. 
\q When a prophet of mine is with you, 
\q2 I will reveal myself to him in visions 
\q2 and speak to him in dreams.
\v 7 My servant Moses is not like that. 
\q He is faithful in all my house.
\v 8 I speak to Moses directly, not with visions or riddles. 
\q He sees my form. 
\q So why are you unafraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?"

  * **My servant Moses is not like that** - "I do not speak to Moses like that"
  * **He is faithful in all my house** - Here "my house" represents the nation of Israel. Being faithful in God's house represents being faithful in leading Israel. AT: "Moses leads my people faithfully" or "Moses is the one whom I trust to lead my people Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **So why are you unafraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?** - Yahweh asks this question to rebuke Miriam and Aaron. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "You should be afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **against my servant, against Moses** - The phrase "against Moses" clarifies that he is the "servant" of whom Yahweh speaks. AT: "against my servant, Moses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
