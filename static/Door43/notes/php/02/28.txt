<usfm>
\v 28 So, I am sending him \add back to you\add* as quickly as possible in order that you may rejoice \add when you see him again\add* and in order that I may be less sorrowful \add than I was\add*.
\v 29-30 Welcome him very joyfully \add just like believers\add* in \add our\add* Lord \add Jesus should welcome one another. While he was\add* working for Christ, he was helping me in place of you \add because you were far away\add*. He knew that he might die as a result of helping me, and \add truly\add* he nearly did die. So honor \add him, and honor all\add* those who are like him.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 So I am sending him back to you as quickly as possible. I will do this in order that you may rejoice when you see him again, and that I might grieve less.
\v 29 Welcome Epaphroditus with the great joy we have because the Lord Jesus loves us. Honor him and other believers like him.
\v 30 As he was working for Christ, he almost died. He ran the risk of dying in order to supply the things that I needed, something you could not do because you are far away from me.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 So it is all the more eagerly that I am sending him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I will be freer from anxiety.
\v 29 Welcome Epaphroditus in the Lord with all joy. Honor people like him.
\v 30 For it was for the work of Christ that he came near death. He risked his life to serve me and fill up what you could not do in service to me.
