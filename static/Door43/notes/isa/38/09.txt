\v 9 When King Hezekiah was almost well again, he wrote this:
\q1
\v 10 I said to myself, "Is it necessary for me to die and go to the place where the dead people are
\q2 during this time of my life when I am still strong?
\q2 Is Yahweh going to rob me of the remaining years that I \add should live\add*?"
\q1
\v 11 I said, "I will not see Yahweh again
\q2 in this world where people are alive.
\q1 I will not see my friends again,
\q2 or be with others who now are alive in this world.
\q1

\p
\v 9 This was the written prayer of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and then recovered:
\q1
\v 10 "I said that halfway through my life
\q1 I will go through the gates of Sheol; I am sent there for the rest of my years.
\q
\q1
\v 11 I said that I will no longer see Yahweh, Yahweh in the land of the living;
\q1 I will no longer look on mankind or the inhabitants of the world.
\f + \ft \fqa the inhabitants of the world \fqb : Most modern versions have this meaning. Ancient Hebrew copies have \fqa the inhabitants of the place of non-existence \fqb (that is, brief existence). \f*
