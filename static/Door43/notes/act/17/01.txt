===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This continues the story of Paul, Silas, and Timothy's missionary trip. They arrive in Thessalonica,  apparently without Luke, since he says "they" and not "we."
  * **General Information:** - Here the word "they" refers to Paul and Silas. Compare [[:en:bible:notes:act:16:40|16:40]]. The word "them" refers to the Jews at the synagogue in Thessalonica.

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Luke, the author, starts to tell a new part of the story.
  * **passed through** - "traveled through"
  * **cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia** - These are coastal cities in Macedonia. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]])
  * **they came to the city** - Here "came" can be translated as "went" or "arrived." AT: "they came to the city" or "they arrived at the city" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_go]])
  * **as his custom was** - "as his habit was" or "as his common practice was." Paul usually went to the synagogue on the Sabbath when Jews would be present.
  * **for three Sabbath days** - "on each Sabbath day for three weeks"
  * **reasoned with them from the scriptures** - Paul explained what the scriptures means in order to prove to the Jews that Jesus is the Messiah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **reasoned with them** - "gave them reasons" or "debated with them" or "discussed with them"
