\v 12 When that happens, I will punish Eli and his family. I will do to them everything that I said that I would do.
\v 13 His sons have shown great disrespect for me by the disgraceful things they have done, and Eli did not restrain them. So I told him that I would punish his family forever.
\v 14 I solemnly promised to Eli's family, 'You will never be able to avoid the consequences for your sin, even if you give me sacrifices or offerings.'~"

\v 12 On that day I will carry out against Eli everything I have said about his house, from beginning to end.
\v 13 I have told him that I am about to judge his house once for all for the sin that he knew about, because his sons brought a curse upon themselves and he did not stop them.
\v 14 Because of this I have sworn to the house of Eli that the sins of his house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering."
