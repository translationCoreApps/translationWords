\v 22 The \add worst\add* liars are the ones who deny that Jesus is the Messiah\f + \ft Or: the one whom God chose to rescue us \f*. They are \add the ones that we told you about\add*, the ones who oppose Christ. They refuse to acknowledge, Or: admit that \add God is\add* the Father and that \add Jesus is his\add* Son \f + \ft Or: the one who is also God \f*.
\v 23 Those who refuse to acknowledge\f + \ft Or: admit \f* that \add Jesus is God's\add* Son do not have a relationship with the Father. But those who acknowledge\f + \ft Or: admit \f* that \add Jesus is God's\add* Son \add not only have a relationship with God's Son, but they\add* have a relationship with the Father also.

<usfm>
\v 22 The worst liars are the ones who deny that Jesus is the Christ. All who do this are against Christ, because they refuse to believe in the Father and the Son.
\v 23 Those who refuse to acknowledge that Jesus is God's Son are in no way joined with the Father, but those who acknowledge that Christ is the Son of God are also joined with Father.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? That person is the antichrist, since he denies the Father and the Son.
\v 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever acknowledges the Son also has the Father.
