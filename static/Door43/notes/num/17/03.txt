\v 3 You must write Aaron's name on Levi's staff. There must be one staff for each leader from his ancestors' tribe.
\v 4 You must place the staffs in the tent of meeting in front of the covenant decrees, where I meet with you.
\v 5 It will happen that the staff of the man whom I choose will bud. I will cause the complaints from the people of Israel to stop, which they are speaking against you."
