===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **A song of ascents** - Possible meanings are 1) "song people sang while going up to Jerusalem for a celebration" or 2) "song people sang while going up the steps into the temple" or 3) "song whose words are like steps." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:120:001|120:1]]
  * **Jerusalem, our feet are standing within your gates!** - The writer briefly stops speaking to his audience and speaks directly to the city of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is spoken to as if it was a person who could hear the writer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **our feet are standing** - Here "feet" refers to the whole person. AT: "we are standing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **within your gates** - Here "gates" refers to the city. AT: "inside you, Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
