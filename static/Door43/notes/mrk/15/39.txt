  * **(the mother of James ... and of Joses)** - "who was the mother of James ... and of Joses." This can be written without the parentheses.

  * **Joses** - This Joses was not that same person as the younger brother of Jesus. See how you translated the same name in [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:06:01|6:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

This is background information about the women who watched the crucifixion from a distance. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **came up with him to Jerusalem** - Jerusalem was higher than almost any other place in Israel, so it was normal for people to speak of going up to Jerusalem and going down from it.
