===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Bring Agag ... to me.** - Samuel is having to do Saul's job of executing Agag.
  * **As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.** - Both of these phrase have similar meaning and are combined here for emphasis. This is a polite way of saying that he will die. AT: "Since you have killed people, you will also die." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
