\v 7 It happened that after ten days, the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah.
\v 8 So Jeremiah called to Johanan son of Kareah and all the army commanders with him, and to all the people from the least to the greatest.
\v 9 Then he said to them, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me so I might lay your pleas before him. Yahweh says this,
\v 10 'If you go back and live in this land, then I will build you and not tear you down; I will plant you and not pull you up, for I will turn back the disaster that I have brought on you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It happened that** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01|1:2]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **to all the people from the least to the greatest** - This is a way to refer to people from every social status. Here "least" and "greatest" represent those who are least important and those who are most important. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:42:01|42:1]]. AT: "to all the people from every social status" or "to all the people, including the least important and the most important people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **to all the people** - Most likely not every individual in the town went. This is a generalization that means very many people went. AT: "to many other people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **I might lay your pleas before him** - "I would present your urgent request to him." Telling the people's request to Yahweh is spoken of as if Jeremiah laid their requests in front of Yahweh. AT: "I might tell him your requests" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will build you and not tear you down** - Yahweh refers to the people of Israel like a wall that can be built or torn down. AT: "I will cause you to prosper and I will not destroy you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will plant you and not pull you up** - Yahweh uses another example to express how he will cause the people of Israel to prosper and not be destroyed. He refers to them like a plant in the same way he referred to them as a wall. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I will turn back the disaster that I have brought on you** - A disaster is here spoken of as something that a person can put onto someone else. AT: "I will prevent the disaster that I have caused to happen to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
