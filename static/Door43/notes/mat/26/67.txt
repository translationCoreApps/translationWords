===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then they** - Possible meanings are 1) "Then some of the men" or 2) "Then the soldiers."
  * **spat in his face** - This was done as an insult.
  * **Prophesy to us** - Here "Prophesy to us" means to tell by means of God's power. It does not mean to tell what will happen in the future.
  * **you Christ** - Those hitting Jesus do not really think he is the Christ. They call him this to mock him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
