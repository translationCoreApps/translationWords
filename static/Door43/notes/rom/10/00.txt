====== Romans 10 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 10:8,18-20, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== God's righteousness ==

Paul teaches here that while many Jews were earnest in the beliefs, they did not gain righteous. God's righteousness cannot be earned, it must be given by Christ through faith. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical questions ==
Paul uses many rhetorical questions to convince his reader that, because salvation is not restricted to the Hebrew people, Christians must be ready to go and share the gospel with the whole world. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:obe:kt:save]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "I will provoke you to jealousy by what is not a nation" ==

This prophecy explains that one function of the church is to provoke the Hebrew people to jealousy so they would return to worshiping God. This will happen in the future. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:jealous]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
