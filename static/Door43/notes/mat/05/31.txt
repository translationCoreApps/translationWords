\v 32 But \add now listen to what\add* I say to you: \add A man\add* may \add divorce his wife\add* only if she has committed adultery, \add and not for any other reason\add*. If a man divorces his wife \add for any other reason, and he has sex with another woman\add*, he makes his wife become one against whom he has committed adultery, \add because in God's estimation she still is his wife\add*. Also, if a man marries a woman who is divorced \f + \ft Or:whose husband has divorced her \f*, \add God considers\add* him\add guilty of\add* committing adultery."

\v 31 "God has said in the scriptures, 'If a man is divorcing his wife, he should write a document on which he states that he is divorcing her.'
\v 32 But now listen to what I say to you: a man may divorce his wife only if she has committed adultery. If a man divorces his wife for any other reason, she commits adultery if she marries someone else. And the man who marries her also commits adultery."

\v 31 It was also said, 'Whoever sends his wife away, let him give her a certificate of divorce.'
\v 32 But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress. Whoever marries her after she has been divorced commits adultery.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to teach about how he has come to fulfill the Old Testament law. Here he begins to speak about divorce.

  * **It was also said** - God is the one who "said." Jesus uses the passive here to make it plain that it is not God or God's word that he disagrees with. Rather, he is saying that a divorce is just only if it occurs for the right reason. A divorce can be unjust even if the man obeys the command to give a written notice. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **sends his wife away** - This is a euphemism for divorce. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **let him give** - "he must give"
  * **But I say** - The "I" is emphatic. This indicates that what Jesus says is equally important to the original commands from God. Try to translate this phrase in a way that shows that emphasis. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:21|5:22]].
  * **makes her an adulteress** - It is the man who divorces the woman improperly who "causes her to commit adultery." In many cultures it would be normal for her to remarry, but if the divorce is improper, such a remarriage is adultery.
  * **her after she has been divorced** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "her after her husband has divorced her" or "the divorced woman" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
