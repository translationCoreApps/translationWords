===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 All the kings of the people-groups to the west of the Jordan River and all the kings of the groups who were descendants of Canaan and who lived close to the \add Mediterranean\add* Sea heard about how Yahweh had dried up the water of the Jordan \add River\add* until all we Israelite people had crossed over. So they became very dismayed. They no longer had the courage to fight us.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 All the kings of the Amorites on the west of the Jordan River and all the kings of Canaanites, who lived close to the Mediterranean coast, heard about how Yahweh had dried up the water of the Jordan River until all the people of Israel had crossed over. They were so afraid that they became too afraid to fight the Israelites, because they had heard all about them.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 As soon as all the kings of the Amorites on the west side of the Jordan, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were along the coast of the Great Sea, heard that Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan until the people of Israel had crossed over, their hearts melted, and there was no longer any spirit in them because of the people of Israel.
\f + \ft Some modern versions have: \fqa until the people of Isreal had crossed over, \fqb and others have, \fqa until we had crossed over. \fqb The Hebrew text has \fqa we, \fqb but a note in the margin instructs readers to say \fqa they. \fqb Translators can decide for themselves. \f*
