===== translationNotes: =====

  * **My life is among lions** - The psalmist speaks of his enemies as if they were lions. AT: "I live among fierce enemies" or "Fierce enemies surround me like lions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **those who are ready to devour me** - Destroying is spoken of as devouring or eating something up. Some versions understand the Hebrew text to mean "fiery beasts." Both images speak of his enemies as if they were wild beasts. AT: "those who are ready to destroy me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **people whose teeth are spears and arrows** - The enemies' spears and arrows are spoken of as if they were lions' teeth. The psalmist continues to speak of his enemies as if they were  lions. AT: "people who kill others with spears and arrows as lions kill with their sharp teeth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **spears and arrows** - Since both of these terms are weapons, if your culture knows only one, it is acceptable to use it alone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **whose tongues are sharp swords** - The tongue represents what someone says, and the enemies' cruel words are spoken of as if they were swords. AT: "whose cruel words are like sharp swords" or "who cause terrible trouble for me by what they say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Be exalted, God, above the heavens** - The psalmist is asking God to show that he is exalted. Being exalted above the heavens represents being great. AT: "God, show that you are exalted above the heavens" or "God, show that you are great in the heavens" (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **let your glory be above all the earth** - The psalmist is asking God to show his glory. AT: "show your glory over all the earth"
