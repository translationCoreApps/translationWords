===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will wipe away mankind ... from the surface of the earth** - The writer speaks of God killing people as if God were wiping dirt off a flat surface. AT: "I will destroy mankind ... so that there will not be any people on the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will wipe away mankind whom I have created** - Some languages would need to translate this as two sentences. AT: "I created mankind. I will wipe them away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])
  * **wipe away** - "completely destroy." Here "wipe away" is used in a negative sense, for God is talking about destroying the people because of their sin.
  * **Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh** - "Yahweh looked favorably on Noah" or "Yahweh was pleased with Noah" (UDB)
  * **in the eyes of Yahweh** - Here "eyes" stands for sight or thoughts. AT: "in Yahweh's sight" or "in Yahweh's thoughts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
