  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

  * **Then he must kill the bull** - Here "he" refers to the one making the offering. It can be stated in second person. AT: "Then you must kill the bull" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **before Yahweh** - "in the presence of Yahweh"
  * **will present the blood** - It is implied that the priests would catch the blood in a bowl as it drained out of the animal. Then they would bring the bowl with the blood in it and present it to Yahweh at the altar. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Then he must skin the burnt offering and cut it to pieces** - As indicated in 1:9, the person must also wash the inner parts and the legs of the animal with water. The person would do this before giving the pieces to the priests so they could place them on the altar. As in the UDB, you can state here the instructions to was the inner parts and legs.
