===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to Zion. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])

  * **I have inscribed your name on my palms** - Yahweh speaks of his unwavering devotion to Zion as if he had written her name on the palms of his hands. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your walls are continually before me** - Yahweh speaks of always thinking about Zion as if her walls were always before him. The word "walls" is a metonym for the city. AT: "I am continually thinking about your walls" or "I am always thinking about you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Your children are hurrying back** - Yahweh speaks of the people who are returning to live in Jerusalem as if they were the city's children. AT: "Your inhabitants are hurrying back" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **As surely as I live** - This is an oath formula that Yahweh uses to guarantee the truth of what he is saying.
  * **declaration of Yahweh** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "declaration" is expressed as the verb "declared" or "solemnly said." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:14:21|14:22]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh declared" or "this is what Yahweh solemnly said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **you will surely wear them like jewelry; you will put them on, like a bride** - Yahweh speaks of the inhabitants of Zion as if they were jewelry that the city wears to show her beauty and joy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you will put them on, like a bride** - The last part of the phrase can be clarified from the previous line. AT: "you will put them on, like a bride wears jewelry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
