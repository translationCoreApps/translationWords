===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They came against me on the day of my distress but Yahweh was my support** - Here "They" refers to the strong enemies in v. 17. The word "distress" describes the condition of one who has many troubles.  AT: "Strong enemies attacked me on a day when I already had many troubles, but Yahweh protected me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
