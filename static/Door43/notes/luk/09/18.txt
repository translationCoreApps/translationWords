===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus is praying, alone with his disciples, and they begin to talk about who Jesus is. Jesus tells them of his death and resurrection that will follow and urges them to follow him no matter what happens.

  * **It came about** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new event. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])
  * **praying by himself** - "praying alone." The disciples were with Jesus, but he was praying personally and privately by himself. 
  * **John the Baptist** - It may be helpful to restate part of the question here. AT: "Some say you are John the Baptist" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **that one of the prophets from long ago has risen** - It may be helpful to clarify how this answer relates to Jesus' question. AT: "that you are one of the prophets from long ago and have risen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **has risen** - "has come back to life"
