  * **Would a person rob God?** - This question implies that the idea of robbing God is very wicked. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "A man should certainly not rob God." or "No one should ever rob me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **How have we robbed you?** - This question implies that the people do not think they have robbed God. AT: "We have certainly not robbed you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **In tithes and offerings** - This reply from Yahweh implies a fuller answer. AT: "You have robbed me by withholding from me your tithes and offerings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **You are cursed with a curse** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I have certainly cursed you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
