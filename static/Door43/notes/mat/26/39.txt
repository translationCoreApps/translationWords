\v 39 After going a little farther, he threw himself facedown on the ground. He prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, do not make me suffer in the way I know I will have to. But do not do as I want. Instead, do as you want!"
\v 40 Then he returned to the three disciples and saw that they were sleeping. He woke Peter and said to him, "I am disappointed that you men fell asleep and were not able to stay awake with me for just a short time!
\v 41 You must keep alert and pray so that you can resist when anyone tempts you to sin. You want to do what I tell you, but you are not strong enough to actually do it."

\v 39 He went a little farther, fell on his face, and prayed. He said, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will."
\v 40 He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "What, could you not watch with me for one hour?
\v 41 Watch and pray that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **fell on his face** - He purposely lay face down on the ground to pray. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **My Father** - This is an important title for God that shows the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **let this cup pass from me** - Here "cup" is a metonym that stands for the cup and the contents within it. The contents in the cup are a metaphor for the suffering that Jesus will have to endure. Jesus is asking the Father if it is possible for him not to have to suffer and die in the way Jesus knows he will in Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yet, not as I will, but as you will** - This can be expressed as a full sentence. AT: "But do not do what I want, but do what you want" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **he said to Peter, "What, could you not watch** - Jesus is speaking to Peter, but the "you" is plural referring to Peter, James, and John. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **What, could you not watch with me for one hour?** - Jesus uses a question to scold Peter, James, and John. AT: "I am disappointed that you could not stay awake with me for one hour!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you do not enter into temptation** - Here the abstract noun "temptation" can be stated as a verb. AT: "no one tempts you to sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak** - Here "spirit" is a metonym that stands for a person's desires. And, "flesh" refers to a human as a whole. Jesus means they may have the desire to do what God wants, but as humans they are weak and will fail. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
