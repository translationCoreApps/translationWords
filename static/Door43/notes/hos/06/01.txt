<usfm>
\v 1 The people say, "Come, let us return to Yahweh.
\q1 He has torn our flesh to pieces as a lion tears up his victim.
\q2 He did this, but he will heal our wounds. 
\q1 He has hurt us and made us fall down,
\q2 but he will treat our wounds and bind them up so they will heal.
\q1
\v 2 After the second day he will restore our strength;
\q2 and on the third day he will raise us up,
\q2 so we will live close to him.
\q1
\v 3 Try to know Yahweh;
\q2 do all you can to be faithful to him.
\q1 It is as certain as tomorrow's sunrise
\q2 that he will come to us; he will come to us like the rain,
\q1 like the rain comes in the spring on our fields."

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The people of Israel confess their need to repent.

  * **he will heal us ... he will bandage our wounds** - Israel believes that God will be merciful to them when they repent, and he will deliver them from their troubles. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **After two days he will revive us; he will raise us up on the third day** - This represents a short period of time. Israel believes God will quickly come to rescue them from their enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **two days ... third day** - "2 days ... 3rd day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **Let us know Yahweh** - Here "know" means not only learn God's character and laws, but also to become faithful to him. (See UDB)
