====== 1 Corinthians 04:10-11 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Many people consider us to be \f + \ft irony \f* fools because \add we preach about\add* Christ, but you proudly \add think \f + \ft irony \f* that\add* you are wise because of your close relationship with\f + \ft Or: you belong to \f* Christ. Many people \add consider us\add* \f + \ft irony \f* to be unimpressive, but you \add proudly think that you\add* impress others. People respect you, but they do not respect us.
\v 11 Up to this present time we have often been hungry. We have often been thirsty. We have ragged clothes. Often we have been beaten \f + \ft Or:others have beaten us \f*. We \add have traveled so much that we\add* have no regular homes to live in.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Others think of us apostles as fools because we live for Christ, and yet you see yourselves as wise people. We appear weak, but you seem to be the strong ones! You praise and honor yourselves, but we apostles are the ones whom other people hate.
\v 11 Up to this present time we apostles go around hungry and thirsty. We have been so poor we could not afford our own clothing. Officials have brutally beaten us again and again. We have no place to call our home.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we are held in dishonor.
\v 11 Up to this present hour we are hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed, we are brutally beaten, and we are homeless.
