===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will place mere youths** - Here the word "I" refers to Yahweh. This can also be translated as "He will appoint boys" (UDB) or "The Lord says, 'I will place mere youths.'"
  * **I will place mere youths as their leaders, and the young will rule over them** - Possible meanings are 1) "I will place young people as their leaders and those young people will rule over them" or 2) "youths" is a metaphor for simple and foolish men, AT: "I will place over them leaders who are immature, like young people, and those bad leaders will rule over them."  These phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that bad leaders will rule Judah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The people will be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Everyone will be cruel to others and will mistreat his neighbor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the degraded** - "the people who are without honor"
  * **the honorable** - "the people with honor"
