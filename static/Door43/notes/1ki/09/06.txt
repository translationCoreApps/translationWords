<usfm>
\v 6 But if you turn away, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have placed before you, and if you go and worship other gods and bow down to them,
\v 7 then will I cut off Israel from off the ground that I have given them; and this house that I have set apart to my name, I will cast it out of my sight, and Israel will become an example to be mocked and an object of ridicule among all peoples.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my commandments and my statutes** - Here the words "commandments" and "statutes" mean basically the same thing and emphasize all that Yahweh has commanded. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **worship other gods and bow down to them** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **set apart to my name** - Here the word "name" is a metonym for the person who possesses something. AT: "set apart for myself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will cast it out of my sight** - The abstract noun "sight" can be expressed with the verb "see." Looking at something is a metaphor for protecting it. AT: "I will put it where I no longer have to see it" or "I will get rid of it so I no longer have to protect it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
