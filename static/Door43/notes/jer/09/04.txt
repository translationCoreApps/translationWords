\q
\v 4 Each of you, be on guard against your neighbor and do not trust in any brother.
\q For every brother is certainly a deceiver, and every neighbor walks in slander.
\q
\v 5 Each man mocks his neighbor and does not speak the truth.
\q Their tongues teach deceitful things. They are exhausted from committing iniquity.
\q
\v 6 Your dwelling is in the midst of deception; in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me. This is Yahweh's declaration."
