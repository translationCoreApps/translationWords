===== translationNotes: =====

  * **To whom then will you compare me, whom do I resemble?** - Yahweh uses two similar rhetorical questions to emphasize that there is no one like him. AT: "There is no one to whom you can compare me. There is no one whom I resemble." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Who has created all these stars?** - This is a leading question that anticipates the answer, Yahweh. AT: "Yahweh has created all these stars!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **He leads out their formations** - Here the word "formations" refers to military formations. The prophet speaks of the stars as if they were soldiers whom Yahweh commands to appear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **By the greatness of his might and by the strength of his power** - The phrases "the greatness of his might" and "the strength of his power" form a doublet that emphasizes Yahweh's power. AT: "By his great might and powerful strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **not one is missing** - This negative statement emphasizes the positive. AT: "every one is present" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
