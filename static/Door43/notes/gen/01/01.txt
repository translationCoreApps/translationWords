  * **In the beginning** - This refers to the start of the world and everything in it.
  * **the heavens and the earth** - "the sky, the ground, and everything in them"
  * **heavens** - This refers here to the sky.
  * **without form and empty** - God had not yet put the world in order.
  * **the deep** - "the water" or "the deep water" (UDB) or "the vast water"
