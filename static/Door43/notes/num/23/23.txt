===== translationNotes: =====

  * **There is no sorcery that works against Jacob ... no fortune-telling harms Israel** - These two lines mean the same thing, that no curse that anyone puts on the nation of Israel will be effective. Here "Jacob" is a metonymy that refers to Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **it must be said** - This can be stated in active form. "people must say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Look what God has done!** - It is implied that what God did for them was good. AT: "Look at the good things God has done for them!"
