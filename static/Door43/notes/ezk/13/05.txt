\v 5 Because you were listening to them, you have not repaired breeches or strengthened your walls. That needs to be done so that the walls will be strong when I, Yahweh, send your enemies to attack you.
\v 6 The visions and prophecies of those prophets are false. They say, 'Yahweh told me this.' I have not sent them to you to be my prophets, but you expect that what they prophesy will truly happen!
\v 7 They say that they have seen visions, but those visions are false, and the things that they prophesy are lies. They say, 'Yahweh told me this,' but I have told them nothing!

\v 5 You have not gone to the breaks in the wall around the house of Israel in order to repair it, in order to resist in battle on the day of Yahweh.
\v 6 The people have false visions and make false predictions, those who say, "Such and such is Yahweh's declaration." Yahweh has not sent them, but they nevertheless have made people hope that their messages would come true.
\v 7 Have you not had false visions and made false predictions, you who say, "Such and such is Yahweh's declaration" when I myself have not spoken?'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the wall around the house of Israel** - This refers to the wall surrounding the city of Jerusalem.
  * **house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **resist in battle** - You can supply the implicit information here. AT: "resist the enemy armies" or "defend the city" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the day of Yahweh** - This refers to the time when Yahweh will judge his people by means of an enemy army. AT: "the day of Yahweh's judgment" or "the day when Yahweh judges you by sending enemy armies to attack you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Have you not had false visions ... when I myself have not spoken?** - Yahweh uses a question to rebuke the false prophets. AT: "You have had false visions ... because I myself have not spoken." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **had false visions and made false predictions** - Since the false prophets have not really received a message from Yahweh, what they predict about the future is not true.
  * **Such and such** - This is a phrase used to refer to anything the prophet may have said. Your language may have another way to say this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Yahweh's declaration** - "is what Yahweh has declared"
