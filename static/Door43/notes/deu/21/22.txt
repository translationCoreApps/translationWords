\v 22 If someone is executed for having committed a crime for which he deserves to die, and you hang his corpse on a post,
\v 23 you must not allow his corpse to remain there all night. You must bury it on the day that he died, because if you keep the corpse on a post, God will curse the land. \add You must bury the corpse that day\add*, in order that you do not defile the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you."

\v 22 If a man has committed a sin worthy of death and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree,
\v 23 then his body must not remain all night on the tree. Instead, you must surely bury him the same day; for whoever is hanged is cursed by God. Obey this commandment so that you do not defile the land that Yahweh your God is giving you as an inheritance.
