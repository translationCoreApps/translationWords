\v 32 To them, you are only a man who sings love songs with a beautiful voice and you play a musical instrument well. They hear what you say, but they do not do what you tell them to do.

\v 32 For you are like a lovely song to them, a beautiful sound that is well played on a stringed instrument, so they will listen to your words, but none of them will obey them.
\v 33 So when all of this happens—behold! it will happen!—then they will know that a prophet has been among them."
