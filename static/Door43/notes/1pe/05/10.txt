<usfm>
\v 10 God is the one who kindly helps us in every situation, and he is the one who chose us to share his eternal glory in heaven because we are joined to Christ. And after you have suffered for a while because of things that people do to harm you, he will remove your spiritual defects, he will strengthen you to trust him more, and he will support you in every way.
\v 11 I pray that he will rule powerfully forever. May it be so!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is the end of Peter's letter. Here he gives his final remarks about his letter and his closing greetings.

  * **for a little while** - "for a short time"
  * **the God of all grace** - Here the word "grace" may refer either to the things that God gives or to God's character. Possible meanings are 1) "the God who always gives us what we need" or 2) "the God who is always gracious."
  * **who called you to his eternal glory in Christ** - "who chose us to share his eternal glory in heaven because we are joined to Christ" (UDB)
  * **perfect you** - "restore you" or "make you well again"
  * **establish you, and strengthen you** - These two expressions have similar meanings, that is, that God will enable the believers to trust in him and to obey him regardless of any suffering they may experience. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
