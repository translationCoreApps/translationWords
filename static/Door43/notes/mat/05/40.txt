===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. All "you" and "your" are singular, as are the commands "let," "go," "give," and "do not turn away," but you may have to translate them as plurals. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **coat ... cloak** - The "coat" was worn close to the body, like a heavy shirt or a sweater. The "cloak," the more valuable of the two, was worn over the "coat" for warmth and also used as a blanket for warmth at night.
  * **let that person also have** - "give also to that person"
  * **And whoever** - "And if a person." It is implied that this is a Roman soldier. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **one mile** - This is one thousand paces, which is the distance a Roman soldier could legally force someone to carry something for him. If "mile" is confusing, it can be translated as "one kilometer" or "a far distance."
  * **with him** - This refers to the one who compels you to go.
  * **go with him two** - "go the mile he forces you to go, then go another mile." If "mile" is confusing, you can translate it as "two kilometers" or "twice as far."
  * **and do not turn away from** - "and do not refuse to lend to." This can be stated in a positive form. AT: "and lend to"
