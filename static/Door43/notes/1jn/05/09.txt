<usfm>
\v 9 We  \add usually\add* believe what  \add other\add* people say. But what God says is more  \add reliable\f + \ft Or: trustworthy \f* than what people say\add*. So  \add we must believe\add* what God has said is true  \add about\add* his Son\f + \ft Or: the one who is also God \f*.
\v 10 Those who trust in the Son of God know within their inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f* that  \add what God\add* says  \add about his Son is true. But\add* those who refuse to believe that  \add what\add* God says is true are saying that God is a liar, because they refuse to believe what God has said about his Son\f + \ft Or: the one who is also God \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 We usually believe what other people tell us. But we can certainly trust much more in what God says. And he has certainly testified about his Son.
\v 10 Those who trust in the Son of God know within their inner beings what is true about him. But those who do not believe what God says call him a liar, because they have refused to believe what God has testified about his Son.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For the testimony of God is this, that he has borne witness concerning his Son.
\v 10 Anyone who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Anyone who does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because he has not believed the witness that God has given concerning his Son.
