<usfm>
\q
\v 8 Nineveh is like a leaking pool of water, with its people fleeing away like rushing water.
\q Others shout, "Stop, stop," but no one looks back.
\q
\v 9 Take the silver plunder, take the gold plunder, for there is no end to it,
\q to the splendor of all Nineveh's beautiful things.
\q
\v 10 Nineveh is empty and ruined. Everyone's heart melts, everyone's knees strike together,
\q and anguish is in everyone; their faces are all pale.
