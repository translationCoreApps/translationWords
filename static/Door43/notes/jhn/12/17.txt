\v 17 The crowd that was with him continued to tell other people that he called Lazarus to come out of the tomb, \add and that Lazarus had then become alive again\add*.
\v 18 Because of that, many people, because they heard \add others say\add* that he had performed this miracle, went to meet him.
\v 19 So the Pharisees said to each other, "It is obvious that we are making no progress \add in trying to stop him! It looks like\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f* everyone \f + \ft metonymy \f* is becoming his disciple!"

\v 17 The crowd that was following along with Jesus kept telling others what they had seen: that Jesus had called Lazarus out of the tomb and had made him alive again.
\v 18 The other crowd of people, those who went out of the city gate to meet Jesus, did so because they heard he had done great things to show them his power.
\v 19 So the Pharisees said to each other, "See! We are gaining no advantage here. Look! The whole world is following him!"

\v 17 Now the crowd that had been with him when he had called Lazarus out from the tomb and had raised him up from the dead ones, testified.
\v 18 It was also for this reason that the crowd went out to meet him because they heard that he had done this sign. 
\v 19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "Look, you can do nothing; see, the world has gone after him."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main narrative. Here John explains that many of the people came to meet Jesus because they heard others say that he had raised Lazarus from the dead. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]]) 
  * **they heard that he had done this sign** - "they heard others say that he had done this sign"
  * **this sign** - A "sign" is an event or occurrence that proves something is true. In this case, the "sign" of raising Lazarus proves that Jesus is the Messiah.
  * **Look, you can do nothing** - The Pharisees imply here that it might be impossible to stop Jesus. AT: "It seems like we can do nothing to stop him!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **see, the world has gone after him** - This is an exaggeration that the Pharisees used to express their shock when so many people came out to meet Jesus. AT: "It looks like everyone is becoming his disciple!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **the world** - Here "the world" is a metonym that represents (in exaggeration) all of the people in the world. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
