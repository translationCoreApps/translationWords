<usfm>
\v 8 Other nations have destroyed Israel's power.
\q2 Now Israel is like an old, broken pot that no one wants. 
\q1
\v 9 They asked the king of Assyria for help; 
\q2 they were like a wild donkey wandering off by itself.
\q1 The people of Israel have tried to pay other nations to protect them.
\q1
\v 10 Although they do this,
\q2 I will soon gather them up to destroy them.
\q2 They will begin to become poor because they will have to pay money to Assyria's king.

\q
\v 8 Israel is swallowed up;
\q now they lie among the nations like something useless.
\q
\v 9 For they went up to Assyria
\q like a wild donkey all alone.
\q Ephraim has hired lovers for herself.
\q
\v 10 Even though they have hired lovers among the nations,
\q I will now gather them together.
\q They will begin to waste away
\q because of the oppression of the king of princes.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking.

  * **Israel is swallowed up** - This can be stated in active form. "swallowed" means to be defeated and taken into exile. AT: "The enemies of Israel have taken the Israelites away to other lands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **like a wild donkey all alone** - People often think of donkeys as being stubborn. This means the people of Israel refused to listen to Yahweh but instead went to the people of Assyria for help. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Ephraim has hired lovers for herself** - Ephraim's alliances with other nations are spoken of as if they had paid them to become prostitutes for Ephraim. AT: "The people of Israel have tried to pay other nations to protect them" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **because of the oppression of the king of princes** - That is, because the Assyrian king, also called "the Great King," will make the people suffer.
