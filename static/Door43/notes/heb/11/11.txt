<usfm>
\v 11 It was because Abraham trusted God that God gave Abraham strength so that he \add was\add* able to produce a son. Even though his wife Sarah was beyond the time \add when women bear children\add*, \add God\add* promised \add that he would give her a son\add*, and Abraham considered that God would do what he promised to do.
\v 12 So, although Abraham was too old to have children, from that one man people descended who are as many in number as the stars in the sky and are as countless as the grains of sand along the shore, \add just like God promised him\add*.

\v 11 It was by faith, even though Sarah herself was barren, that Abraham received power to conceive. This happened even though he was too old, since they considered as faithful the one who had given them a promise.
\v 12 Therefore, from this one man, who was almost dead, were born those who were like the stars in the sky for their multitude and like the grains of sand along the seashore, which are uncountable.
