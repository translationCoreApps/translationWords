\v 16 Judah replied, "Sir, what can we say? How can we prove that we are innocent\f + \ft Or: did not steal the cup \f*? God has paid us back\f + \ft Or: punished us \f* for the sins we committed many years ago. So now we will become your slaves—both we and the one in whose sack the cup was found."
\v 17 But Joseph replied, "No, I could never do anything like that. Only the man in whose sack the cup was found will become my slave. The rest of you can return to your father peacefully."

\v 16 Judah said, "What can we say to my master? What can we speak? Or how can we justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Look, we are my master's slaves, both we and he also in whose hand the cup was found."
\v 17 Joseph said, "Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup was found, that person will be my slave, but as for you others, go up in peace to your father."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **What can we say to my master? What can we speak? Or how can we justify ourselves?** - All 3 questions mean basically the same thing. They use these questions to emphasize that there is nothing they can say to explain what happened. AT: "We have nothing to say, my master. We cannot speak anything of value. We cannot justify ourselves." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **What can we say to my master ... my master's slaves** - Here "my master" refers to Joseph. This is a formal way of speaking to someone with greater authority. It can be stated in second person. AT: "What can we say to you ... your slaves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **God has found out the iniquity of your servants** - Here "found out" does not mean God just found out what the brothers did. It means God is now punishing them for what they did. AT: "God is punishing us for our past sins"
  * **the iniquity of your servants** - The brothers refer to themselves as "your servants." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with greater authority. It can be stated in first person. AT: "our iniquity" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **and he also in whose hand the cup was found** - Here "hand" stands for the whole person. Also, "was found" can be stated in active form. AT: "and the one who had your cup" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Far be it from me that I should do so** - Something that a person would never do is spoken of as if it were an object the person wants put far away from him. AT: "It is not like me to do something like that" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The man in whose hand the cup was found** - Here "hand" stands for the whole person. Also, "was found" can be stated in active form. AT: "The man who had my cup" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
