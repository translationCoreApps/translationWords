\v 8 But I will allow some of you to remain alive. They will escape being killed when your enemies scatter you among many other nations.
\v 9 When that happens, in those nations to which you have been forced to go, those of you who have escaped from being killed will think about me. You will remember that I was very grieved because of your turning away from me [IDI] with your inner beings, and because you very much desired [IDI] to worship your idols. You will hate\f + \ft Or: be very displeased with \f* yourselves because of the evil and detestable things that you have done.
\v 10 And \add you will realize that\add* I, Yahweh, \add have punished you\add*. \add You will realize that\add* when I threatened to punish you, I surely intended \f + \ft litotes \f* to do that.

\v 9 When that happens, in those nations to which you have been forced to go, those of you who have escaped death will think about me. You will remember that I was very grieved because you turned away from me, because you were disloyal to me, and because you desired to worship your idols. You will hate yourselves because of the evil and detestable things that you have done.
\v 10 And you will realize that I, Yahweh, have punished you. You will realize that when I threatened to punish you, I surely intended to do that.

\v 8 But I will preserve a remnant among you, and there will be some who escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered throughout the countries.
\v 9 Then those who escape will think of me among the nations where they will be held captive, that I was grieved by their promiscuous heart that turned away from me, and by their eyes that whored after their idols. Then they will show loathing on their face for the wickedness which they have committed with all their abominations.
\v 10 So they will know that I am Yahweh. It was for a reason that I said I would bring this evil to them.
