\v 50 \add As a result, I\add* will consider that many of you people \add who have observed my Son's ministry\add* will be guilty \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add of murder, as if you had\add* killed all the prophets that other people have killed, from the time I created the world,
\v 51 starting from \add Adam's son Cain\add* killing \add his brother\add* Abel and continuing until they killed the prophet Zechariah \add in the holy place\add* between the altar and the temple.' Yes, what I am saying \add is true\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. \add God\add* will punish you people who have observed my ministry whom \add he\add* considers to be guilty \f + \ft metonymy \f* for \add killing\add* all those prophets!

\v 49 So God, who is very wise, had said, 'I will send prophets and apostles to guide my people. But they will cause them to suffer greatly and will even kill some of them.'
\v 50 As a result, many of the people living now at this time will be considered guilty of the murder of all God's prophets from the time the world was created,
\v 51 starting from when Abel was killed by his brother and continuing until the prophet Zechariah was killed in the temple between the altar and the holy place. Yes, the people living at this time will be considered guilty for all those murders of the prophets!

<usfm>
\v 49 For this reason also, God's wisdom said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles, and they will persecute and kill some of them.'
\v 50 This generation, then, will be held responsible for all the blood of the prophets shed since the world began,
\v 51 from Abel's blood to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I say to you, this generation will be held responsible.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For this reason** - This refers back to the previous statement that the teachers of the law burdened people with rules. 
  * **God's wisdom said** - "wisdom" is treated as if it was able to speak for God. AT: "God in his wisdom said" or "God wisely said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **I will send to them prophets and apostles** - "I will send prophets and apostles to my people." God had declared beforehand that he would send prophets and apostles to the ancestors of the Jewish audience to whom Jesus was speaking. 
  * **they will persecute and kill some of them** - "my people will persecute and kill some of the prophets and apostles." God had declared beforehand that the ancestors of the Jewish audience to whom Jesus was speaking would persecute and kill the prophets and apostles. 
  * **This generation, then, will be held responsible for all the blood of the prophets shed** - The people to whom Jesus was speaking will be held responsible for the murder of the prophets by their ancestors. AT: "Therefore, God will hold this generation responsible for all the deaths of the prophets that people have killed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the blood of the prophets shed** - The "blood ... shed" refers to the blood spilled when they were killed. AT: "the murder of the prophets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Zechariah** - This was probably the priest in the Old Testament who rebuked the people of Israel for idolatry. This was not the Father of John the Baptist.
  * **who was killed** - This could be stated in active form. AT: "that the people killed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
