===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus appears to the disciples. When the two men previously arrived at the house where the Eleven were, Jesus was not with them.

  * **Jesus himself** - The word "himself" focuses on Jesus and the surprise of Jesus actually appearing to them. Most of them had not seen him after his resurrection. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
  * **in the midst of them** - "among them"
  * **Peace be to you** - "May you have peace" or "May God give you peace!" (UDB) The word "you" is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **But they were terrified** - "But" indicates a strong contrast. Jesus told them to be at peace, but they were very afraid instead.
  * **terrified and filled with fear** - "startled and afraid" (UDB). These two phrases mean about the same thing, and are used together to emphasize their fear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **supposed that they saw a spirit** - "thought that they were seeing a ghost." They did not yet truly understand that Jesus was really alive.
  * **a spirit** - Here it refers to the spirit of a dead person.
