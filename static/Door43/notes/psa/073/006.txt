===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Asaph continues to describe how he sometimes wants to complain to God about those who are "arrogant" and "wicked" ([[:en:bible:notes:psa:073:001|73:3]]).

  * **Pride adorns them like a necklace around their neck; violence clothes them like a robe** - This means the wicked show everyone how proud and violent they are as if they were wearing a necklace or beautiful robe. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **necklace ... robe** - things that rich and important people wear
  * **necklace** - a chain usually made of gold or jewels that goes around the neck
  * **Out of such blindness comes sin** - Because they are like blind people who cannot see where they are going, they sin without knowing it. Being blind is a metaphor for a person being unable to see how wicked he is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **evil thoughts pass through their hearts** - The psalmist speaks of what people think as if it were people and of the inner beings of wicked people as if they were a building through which those people could walk. "in their inner beings they are always thinking about more evil things to do" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
