\v 73 After a little while those who were standing by came and said to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for the way you speak gives you away."
\v 74 Then he began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man," and immediately a rooster crowed.
\v 75 Peter remembered the words that Jesus had said, "Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times." Then he went outside and wept bitterly.
