===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **circumcise your heart** - This is not a literal removal of flesh. It means God will remove their sin and enable them to love and obey him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **with all your heart and with all your soul** - The idiom "with all ... heart" means "completely" and "with all ... soul" means "with all your being." These two phrases have similar meaning. AT: "with all your being" or "with all your energy" Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:04:29|4:29]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **obey the voice of Yahweh** - Here "voice" means what Yahweh says. AT: "obey what Yahweh says" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **will put all these curses on your enemies** - Moses speaks of curses as though they were a load or a cover that someone could physically put on top of a person. AT: "will cause your enemies to suffer from these curses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
