====== 1 Timothy 05:14-16 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 So I advise that \add instead of putting the names of younger widows on the list, they\add* marry again, that they bear\f + \ft Or: have \f* children, that they manage their homes \add well\add*, and that they do nothing about which an enemy can say bad things about \add them\add*.
\v 15 \add I say this\add* because some \add younger widows\add* have stopped \add obeying Christ\add* in order to obey Satan.
\p
\v 16 If any woman who believes \add in Christ\add* has widows \add in her household\f + \ft Or: family \f*\add*, she should take care of them. The congregation should not be burdened by having \f + \ft Or:She should not depend on the congregation \f* to take care of their \add needs\add*. The congregation should take care of the widows who truly \add have no one to care for them\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 So I prefer that younger widows get married, have children, and run their households, so that Satan, the enemy, gets no opportunity to accuse them of doing wrong.
\v 15 I write these things because some younger widows have already left the way of Christ to follow Satan.
\p
\v 16 If any believing woman has widows among her relatives, let her help them, so those widows will not be a burden to the church. In this way the church will be able to help real widows.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I therefore want younger women to marry, to bear children, to manage the house, in order to give the adversary no opportunity to accuse us of doing evil.
\v 15 For some have already turned aside after Satan.
\v 16 If any believing woman has widows, let her help them, so that the church will not be weighed down, so that it might help the real widows.
