\q
\v 4 For the arrows of the Almighty are in me,
\q my spirit drinks up the poison;
\q the terrors of God have arranged themselves in array against me.
\q
\v 5 Does the wild donkey bray in despair when he has grass?
\q Or does the ox low in hunger when it has fodder?
\q
\v 6 Can that which has no taste be eaten without salt?
\q Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's intense suffering as the grounds for his complaint. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 

  * **For the arrows of the Almighty are in me** - This is a metaphor for Job's suffering. He compares his many troubles to arrows that that God has shot his body with. AT: "It is as though the Almighty has shot arrow into my body" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
  * **my spirit drinks up the poison** - "my spirit drinks up the arrow's poison." This continues the metaphor of the arrows, by implying that they had tips of poison and that Job feels the pain in his spirit. He speaks of feeling this pain as if his spirit drank the poison. AT: "I feel the pain of their poison in my inner being" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the terrors of God have arranged themselves in array against me** - Job speaks of the terrible things that have happened to him as if they were soldiers that God had lined up to attack him all at once.
