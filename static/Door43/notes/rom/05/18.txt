\v 18 So, because one man, Adam, disobeyed God's law, all people deserve to be punished. Similarly, because one man, Jesus, acted righteously by obeying God while he lived and died, God offers to put everyone right with himself, for them to live forever.
\v 19 It was because one person, Adam, disobeyed God that many people became sinners. Similarly, it is because one person, Jesus, obeyed God when he died that he will put many right with himself.

\v 18 So then, as through one trespass all people came to condemnation, even so through one act of righteousness came the justification of life for all people.
\v 19 For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one will the many be made righteous.
