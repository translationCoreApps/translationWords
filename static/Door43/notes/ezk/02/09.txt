===== translationNotes: =====

  * **a hand was extended out to me** - It was as if 1) a person in the heavens had extended his hand out toward Ezekiel and all Ezekiel could see was from the hand to the elbow or shoulder or 2) the "one who looked like a man" ([[:en:bible:notes:ezk:01:26|1:26]]) extended his hand.
  * **a written scroll** - "a scroll that had writing on it"
  * **He spread it out** - The word "He" refers to the "one who looked like a man" ([[:en:bible:notes:ezk:01:26|1:26]]).
  * **it had been written on both its front and back** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "someone had written on both its front and its back" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **written on it were lamentations, mourning, and woe** - The abstract nouns "lamentations," "mourning," and "woe" can be translated as adjectives. AT: "someone had written on it that these people would lament, be sad the way they would be if someone they loved had died, and have bad things happen to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
