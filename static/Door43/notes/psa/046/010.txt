===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Be quiet and know that I am God** - Here, God begins to speak.
  * **Be quiet** - In this context, these words are likely a command to the nations to stop their wars. AT: "Stop fighting" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **know that I am God** - Here the word "know" means to understand and to confess that Yahweh is the true God.
  * **I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted on the earth** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the people of every nation in the world will exalt God. This can be stated in active form. AT: "People from every nation will exalt me; people all over the earth will exalt me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Yahweh of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge** - The writer speaks of God as if he were a place where people can go for safety. See how you translated these lines in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:046:006|46:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
