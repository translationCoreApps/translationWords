  * **How will he punish you, and what more will he do to you, you who have a lying tongue?** - The writer asks this as a leading question to explain what God will do to liars. AT: "This is how God will punish you, and this is what he will do to you, you who have a lying tongue." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you who have a lying tongue** - Here "a lying tongue" represents the person who speaks lies. AT: "you who tell lies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **He will punish you with the arrows of a warrior** - The writer speaks of God severely punishing liars as if God were shooting them with arrows. AT: "He will punish you severely, as if he were shooting you with warrior's arrows" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **sharpened over burning coals of the broom tree** - This refers to how people forged the tip of the arrow in a fire. This can be stated in active form. AT: "that he sharpened over burning coals of the broom tree" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
