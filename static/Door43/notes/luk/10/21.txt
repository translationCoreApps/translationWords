\v 21 Right then, Jesus was filled with great joy from the Holy Spirit. He said, "Father, you are Lord over everything in heaven and on earth. Some people think that they are wise because they are well educated. But I praise you that you have prevented them from knowing these things. Instead, you have revealed them to people who accept your truth readily as little children do. Yes, Father, you have done that because it pleased you to do so."

\v 21 At that same time he rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you concealed these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to those who are untaught, like little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well pleasing in your sight."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **Lord of heaven and earth** - "heaven" and "earth" represent everything that exists. AT: "Master over everyone and everything in heaven and earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **these things** - This refers to Jesus' previous teaching about the authority of the disciples. It may be best to simply say "these things" and let the reader determine the meaning.
  * **the wise and understanding** - "from people who are wise and have understanding." Because God had concealed truth from them, these people were not actually wise and understanding, even though they thought they were. AT: "from people who think they are wise and educated" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **those who are untaught** - This refers to those who may not have much education, but who are willing to accept Jesus' teachings. AT: "people who may have little eduction, but who listen to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **like little children** - "as little children." People who know that they are not wise and knowledgeable are willing to be taught, as children are willing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **for so it was well pleasing in your sight** - "for it pleases you to do this"
