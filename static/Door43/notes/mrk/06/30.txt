===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - After the disciples return from preaching and healing, they go somewhere to be alone, but there are many people who come to hear Jesus teach. When it becomes late, he feeds the people and then sends everyone away while he prays alone.

  * **a deserted place** - a place where there are no people
  * **many were coming and going** - This means that people were continually coming to the apostles and then going away from them. 
  * **they did not even** - The word "they" refers to the apostles.
  * **So they went away** - Here the word "they" includes both the apostles and Jesus.
