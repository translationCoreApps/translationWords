<usfm>
\v 20 At that time, you will see Zion Hill, the place where we celebrate our festivals;
\q2 You will see that Jerusalem has become a place that is calm and safe.
\q2 It will be \add secure\add*,
\q1 like \f + \ft simile \f* a tent \add that cannot be moved because\add* its ropes are tight
\q2 and its stakes are firmly in the ground.
\q1
\v 21 Yahweh will be our mighty God;
\q1 he will be like \f + \ft simile \f* a mighty river that will protect us
\q2 because our enemies will not be able to cross it;
\q2 no one will be able to row across it
\q2 and no ships will be able to sail across it.

\v 20 At that time, you will see Mount Zion, the place where we celebrate our festivals;
\q2 You will see that Jerusalem has become a place that is calm and safe.
\q2 It will be secure,
\q1 like a tent that cannot be moved because its ropes are tight
\q2 and its stakes are firmly in the ground.
\q1
\v 21 Yahweh will be our mighty God;
\q1 he will be like a mighty river that will protect us
\q2 because our enemies will not be able to cross it;

<usfm>
\q1
\v 20 Look at Zion, the city of our feasts; 
\q1 your eyes will see Jerusalem as a quiet habitation, a tent that will not be removed, 
\q1 whose stakes will never be pulled up nor will any of its cords be broken.
\q1
\v 21 Instead, Yahweh in majesty will be with us, in a place of broad rivers and streams. 
\q1 No warship with oars will travel it, and no large ships will sail by.

  * **a tent that will not be removed** - This can be stated in active form. It may be translated as a new sentence. AT: "It will be like a tent that no one will ever remove" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **whose stakes will never be pulled up nor will any of its cords be broken** - This can be translated in active form. This can be translated as a new sentence.

  * **Yahweh in majesty will be with us, in a place of broad rivers and streams** - Here "us" refers to Isaiah and includes the people of Judah. This compares the safety of living with Yahweh to a place that has rivers around it so that enemies cannot attack them.
