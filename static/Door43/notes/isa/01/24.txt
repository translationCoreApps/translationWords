===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Therefore** - "For that reason"
  * **this is the declaration of the Lord** - "thus declares the Lord"
  * **I will take vengeance against my adversaries, and avenge myself against my enemies** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. AT: "I will punish those who opposed me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I will turn my hand against you** - Here "hand" refers to God's power which he would use to punish his people. AT: "I will turn my power against you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **refine away your dross as with lye** - Here the process in which God removes his people's sin is spoken of as if metal were being refined. The expression "as with lye" is used to intensify the expression, even though lye is used in soap, not in refining metal. AT: "and like fire removing the dirt from silver, I will remove all the evil from among you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **take away all your dross** - This expression continues the same metaphor.
