\v 1 One day, Naomi said to Ruth, "My daughter, I think that I should try to arrange for you to have a home and a husband who will provide for you.
\v 2 Boaz is a close relative of ours, and he has been very kind by letting you gather grain with his servant girls. Listen carefully. Tonight he will be at the place where they thresh the barley. He will be separating the grain from the chaff.

\v 1 Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, "My daughter, should I not seek a place for you to rest, so that things may go well for you?

  * **a place for you to rest** - Possible meanings are 1) literally in finding a house for her to live in or 2) figuratively in finding a husband to care for her. Naomi probably had both senses in mind. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
