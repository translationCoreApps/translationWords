\v 5 "I myself made the earth by my great strength and my raised arm. I also made the people and animals on the earth, and I give it to anyone who is right in my eyes.
\v 6 So now, I myself am giving all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, my servant. Also, I am giving the living things in the fields to him to serve him.
\v 7 For all the nations will serve him, his sons, and his grandsons until the time for his land to end comes. Then many nations and great kings will subdue him.
