\v 7 Then \add your ancestors\add* pleaded with me to help them. So he caused darkness\f + \ft Or: a very dark cloud \f* to come between your ancestors and the Egyptian army, so that the Egyptian army could not see your ancestors. I separated the water so that your ancestors could cross it, but when the Egyptian army tried to cross in the same way to pursue them, I caused the water to come back and cover them, and the Egyptian soldiers all drowned, as your ancestors watched and were amazed [IDI]. But after that, you lived in the desert for many years.

<usfm>
\v 7 Joshua continued to speak: "When you pleaded to Yahweh for help, he caused darkness to come between the nation of Israel and the Egyptian army, and he covered the Egyptian army with the waters of the sea so that your enemies were drowned. This is what Yahweh says: 'You saw what I did in Egypt. You lived in the desert for many years.
