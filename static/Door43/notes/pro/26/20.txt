\v 20 If there is no more firewood \add to put on the fire\add*, the fire will go out;
\q2 similarly \f + \ft simile \f*, if there are no people who gossip\f + \ft Or: tell people things that are not true \f*, quarreling will end.
\b
\q1
\v 21 Putting charcoal on burning coals or putting wood on a fire causes the fire to keep burning;
\q2 similarly, people who like to quarrel cause people to keep arguing.

\q1
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 The fire goes out when there is no more wood to burn;
\q2 and so arguments stop when no one is gossipping.

\q1
\v 21 As charcoal can ignite into burning coal and a log of wood into a fire;
\q2 so the one who argues sets anger ablaze.

\q1
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 20 For lack of wood, the fire goes out;
\q and where there is no gossiper quarreling ceases.
\q
\v 21 As charcoal is to burning coals and wood is to fire,
\q so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife.
