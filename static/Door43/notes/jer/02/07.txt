<usfm>
\v 7 But when I, Yahweh, brought you into a very fertile land,
\q2 in order that you could enjoy all the fruit and other good things that you would harvest,
\q1 you caused the land that I promised to give to you to be unfit for me
\q2 and to become disgusting to me.
\q1
\v 8 Your priests also did not ask
\q2 if I was still with them.
\q1 Those who teach God's laws are not faithful to me themselves!
\q2 And your leaders have rebelled against me.
\q1 Your prophets gave you messages from their god Baal,
\q2 and they worship worthless idols.

<usfm>
\q
\v 7 But I brought you to the land of Carmel, to eat its fruit and other good things!
\q Yet when you came, you defiled my land, you made my inheritance an abomination!
\q
\v 8 The priest did not say, 'Where is Yahweh?' and the experts in the law did not care about me!
\q The shepherds transgressed against me. The prophets prophesied for Baal and walked after unprofitable things.
