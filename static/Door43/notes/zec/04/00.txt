====== Zechariah 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is written mainly in prose about the fifth vision about the golden lampstand and olive trees. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 4:6-7, 9-14, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Visions ==
This chapter shows a conversation between Zechariah and the angel of Yahweh. It is important for each of these visions to keep their meanings and not be interpreted to mean any specific thing.
