\v 7 All things on this earth will soon come to an end. Therefore, keep thinking sensibly, and control what you think so that you can pray well.
\v 8 Most importantly of all, love each other sincerely, because if we love others we will not try to find out what they have done wrong.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The end of all things is coming** - This refers to the end of the world at Christ's second coming.
  * **is coming** - will soon happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **be of sound mind, and be sober in your thinking** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Peter uses them to emphasize the need to think clearly about life since the end of the world is near. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **be sober in your thinking** - Here the word "sober" refers to mental clarity and alertness. AT: "control your thoughts" or "be careful about what you think." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1pe:01:13|1:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Above all things** - "Most importantly of all" (UDB)
  * **for love covers a multitude of sins** - Peter describes "love" as if it were a person who places a cover over the sins of others. Possible meanings are 1) "for a person who loves will not try to find out if another person has sinned" or 2) "for a person who loves will forgive the sins of other people, even if those sins are many" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Be hospitable** - show kindness to and welcome guests and travelers
