===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. He continues to quote Yahweh's words. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **I will heap disasters on them** - Yahweh speaks of bad things that would happen to the Israelites as if they were something like dirt that he could pile up on top of the Israelites. AT: "I will make sure that many bad things happen to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will shoot all my arrows at them** - Here Yahweh compares the bad things he will make sure happen to the Israelites to someone shooting arrows from a bow. AT: "I will do all I can do to kill them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They will be wasted by hunger** - This can be stated in active form. The abstract noun "hunger" can be translated as the verb "be hungry." AT: "They will grow weak and die because they are hungry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **They will ... hunger and devoured by burning heat and bitter destruction** - Possible meanings are the Israelites will suffer from 1) fevers and plagues or 2) the heat during a drought or famine. This can be stated in active form. AT: "They will ... hunger, and burning heat and terrible disasters will devour them" or "They will ... hunger, and they will die from the burning heat and terrible disasters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I will send on them the teeth of wild animals, with the poison of things that crawl in the dust** - The teeth and the poison are synecdoche for the animals that use these things to kill. AT: "I will send wild animals to bite them, and things that crawl in the dust to bite and poison them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
