====== Ephesians 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 5:13, which is a reference to the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Inheritance of the kingdom of Christ ==
This is a difficult concept to understand. Because all of these sins can be forgiven, it should be obvious the inheritance talked about here is not eternal life. Some scholars though believe those who continue to practice these things will not inherit eternal life. It seems to be more natural to see "inheriting the kingdom" as referencing a future kingdom. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:forgive]], [[:en:obe:kt:eternity]], [[:en:obe:kt:life]] and [[:en:obe:kt:inherit]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Wives, submit to your husbands ==
Scholars are divided over how to understand this passage in light of its historical and cultural context. Some scholars believe men and women are perfectly equal in all things (known as "egalitarianism"). Other scholars believe men and women were created to distinct and to serve in different roles in marriage and the church (known as "complementarianism"). One understanding of this issue will likely affect how this passage is translated.
