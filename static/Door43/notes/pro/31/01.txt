===== translationNotes: =====

  * **King Lemuel** - This is the name of a king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **oracle** - message from God. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:30:01|30:1]].
  * **What, my son? What is it, son of my womb? What do you want, son of my vows?** - Possible meanings of the rhetorical question "What" are 1) "What are you doing?" or "You should not be doing what you are doing"  or 2) "What shall I tell you?" or "Listen to what I am telling you" or 3) "Do not do the things I am about to warn you against." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **my son ... son of my womb ... son of my vows** - The speaker wants the hearer to notice carefully and to respect the one who is talking to him.
  * **son of my womb** - The womb is a synecdoche for the person. It is best to use a polite term for the body part in which babies grow before they are born.
  * **son of my vows** - The "vows" could be 1) the mother's marriage vows or 2) a vow after she married that if God allowed her to have a child she would dedicate him to God.
  * **Do not give your strength to women** - "Do not work hard trying to have sex with women," either outside of marriage or with concubines.
