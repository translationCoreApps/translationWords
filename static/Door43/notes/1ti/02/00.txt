====== 1 Timothy 02 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Peace ==
Paul encourages the Christians to live peaceful live by exercising discipline and self-control. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:discipline]])

== Women in the church ==
Paul is probably instructing the women how to use their freedom in Christ in such a way that it does not upset the normal cultural standards for women. Because of the potential for controversy, extra care should be taken in translating these passages. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings" ==
There is some overlap in meaning to these terms. It is not necessary to view these as perfectly distinct categories.
