====== Isaiah 46 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

== Yahweh and the false gods ==
This chapter is set up to compare Yahweh with various false Gods whom the Israelites worship. There really is no comparison; Yahweh alone is God. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]])
