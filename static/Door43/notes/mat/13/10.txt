\v 10 The disciples approached Jesus later and asked him, "Why do you use parables when you speak to the crowd?"
\v 11 He answered, "God is revealing to you what he did not reveal before, about how he is ruling from heaven. But he has not revealed it to these other people.
\v 12 Those who are able to think about what I say and understand it, God will enable them to understand more. But those who are not able think carefully about what I say will forget even what they already know.

\v 10 The disciples came and said to Jesus, "Why do you talk to the crowd in parables?"
\v 11 Jesus answered and said to them, "You have been given the privilege of understanding mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
\v 12 Because whoever has, even more will be given. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
