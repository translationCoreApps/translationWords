===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus clearly tells Peter he will deny him. Peter and all of the disciples are certain they will not deny Jesus.

  * **I am raised up** - This means that God will raise Jesus from the dead. This can be written in active form. AT: "God raises me from the  dead" or "God makes me alive again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I will go ahead of you** - "I will go before you"
  * **Even if all fall away, I will not** - "I will not" can be fully expressed as "I will not fall away." The phrase "not fall away" is a double negative and carries a positive meaning. This can be expressed in the positive if needed. AT: "Even if everyone else leaves you, I will stay with you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
