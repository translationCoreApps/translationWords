\v 9 When you harvest your grain, leave the grain at the very edge of the field, and do not pick up the grain that has fallen on the ground.
\v 10 And when you harvest your grapes, do not go back a second time to try to harvest some more, and do not pick up the grapes that have fallen on the ground.

\v 9 When you reap the harvest of your land, you must not completely reap the corners of your field, neither will you gather all the produce of your harvest.
