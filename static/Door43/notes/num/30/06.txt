\v 6 If her father overrules her on the day he hears all the vows she made and her solemn promises with which she has bound herself, then they will stand. Yahweh will forgive her because her father had overruled her.

\v 6 However, if her father hears all the vows she made and her solemn promises with which she has bound herself, and if he overrules her on that same day, then they will not remain in force. Yahweh will forgive her because her father had overruled her.
\v 7 If she marries a man while she is under those vows, or if she makes rash promises with which she obligates herself, those obligations will remain in force.
