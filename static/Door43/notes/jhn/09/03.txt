\v 3 Jesus replied, "It was not that either this man or his parents sinned. He was born blind so that today people may see the powerful work God would do in him.
\v 4 We must do the works of the one who sent me while it is still day. Night is on the way and when it arrives, no one will be able to work.
\v 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."

  * **light of the world** - Here "light" is a metaphor for the true revelation of God. AT: "the one who shows what is true just as light allows people to see what is in the darkness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
