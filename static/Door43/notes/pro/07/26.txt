===== translationNotes: =====

  * **brought down** - On the one hand it is an idiom for "ruined" (UDB) or "destroyed", but it also begins the metaphor of entering Sheol which is always described as down. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Her house** - AT: "She" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Her house is on the road to Sheol ... it goes down** - AT: "Her destination is Sheol; she is going down"
  * **the rooms of death** - This expression pictures the dead as lying in many different rooms in Sheol. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **on the road to Sheol ... down to the rooms of death** - These two phrases basically mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize that the adulteress will be destroyed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
