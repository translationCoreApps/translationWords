\v 33 So now sell the things that you own. Give the money to those who do not have the food and clothing they need or a place to live. Get yourselves wallets that do not wear out, and you will store up treasure in heaven where it will always be safe. There, no thief can come near to steal it, and no moths can destroy your clothing.
\v 34 Whatever it is that you treasure, that is what you will think about and spend your time on.

\v 34 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
