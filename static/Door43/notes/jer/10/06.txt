===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah has just been talking about idol worship.

  * **Who does not fear you, king of the nations?** - Jeremiah does not expect an answer to this question. It is more like a statement. AT: "Everyone should fear you, king of the nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **what you deserve** - "what you have earned"
