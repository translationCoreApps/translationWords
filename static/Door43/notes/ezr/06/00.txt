====== Ezra 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The completion of story of the building of the temple and re-establishment of the temple worship occurs in this chapter. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:temple]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Temple taxes ==
The king said the Jews were right and ordered money from his taxes be used to help them with their sacrifices. 


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===
== Darius ==
Assyria's King Darius was king of Persia. Since Persia had conquered Babylon, which had conquered Assyria, he was also the king of Assyria. Here it is probably used in contrast to the former times when Assyria was cruel to the Jews or that they conquered the northern tribes of Israel.
