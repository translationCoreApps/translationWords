\v 10 Noah waited seven more days. Then he sent the dove out of the boat again.
\v 11 This time the dove returned to him in the evening and, surprisingly, there was a leaf from an olive tree that the dove had just plucked in its beak. Then Noah knew that the water had truly receded from the surface of the ground.
\v 12 Noah waited seven more days. Then he sent the dove out again, but it did not return to him again.

\v 10 He waited another seven days and again he sent out the dove from the ark.
\v 11 The dove returned to him in the evening. Look! In her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had gone down from the earth.
\v 12 He waited another seven days, and sent out the dove again. She did not return again to him.
