====== Revelation 13 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 13:10, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== A lethal wound ==
Many scholars believe this is a prophecy about the death of the antichrist. They believe the antichrist will mimic or counterfeit the resurrection of Jesus. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:antichrist]] and [[:en:obe:kt:resurrection]])
=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== The beast ==
Many scholar believe this is a metaphorical way to refer to the antichrist. This is very significant for proper understanding of this passage. This is used on contrast to the lamb, which is a reference to Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_apocalypticwriting]])

== Another beast ==
Many scholars believe this second beast is a prophet or priest of the antichrist. He is capable of performing many wondrous miracles and gets many people to worship the antichrist. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Unknown animals ==
This chapter uses a great number of unknown animals. Many of these animals are used in a symbolic way but their meaning is imprecise. This will cause great difficulties for translators. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
