\v 6 \add Later\add* the high priests \add found\add* the coins. They picked them up and said, "This is money that we paid\add to have a man killed\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and our law does not allow\add such money\add* to be put \f + \ft Or:us to put \add such money\add* \f* into the \add Temple treasury\add*."
\v 7 So they decided to use that money to buy the field where clay was dug for making pots \f + \ft Or:men dug ground for making pots \f*. \add They made that field\add* a place where they buried strangers \add who died in Jerusalem\add*.
\v 8 That is why that place is still called \f + \ft Or:why they still call that place \f* 'The field of blood.'

\v 6 The high priests picked up the coins and said, "This is money that we paid for a man to die, and our law does not allow us to put money like this into the temple treasury."
\v 7 So they decided to use that money to buy a field that was called the Potter's Field. They made that field a place where they buried strangers who died in Jerusalem.
\v 8 That is why that place is still called "The Field of Blood."

\v 6 The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, "It is not lawful to put this into the treasury, because it is the price of blood."
\v 7 They discussed the matter together and with the money bought the potter's field in which to bury strangers.
\v 8 For this reason that field has been called, "The Field of Blood" to this day.
