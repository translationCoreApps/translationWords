====== Ezekiel 20:23-24 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 I lifted up my hand and solemnly declared to them in the desert that I would cause them to be scattered among many nations \f + \ft doublet \f*,
\v 24 because they had rejected and disobeyed all my laws \f + \ft doublet \f* and desecrated the Sabbath days, and they had eagerly desired \add to worship\add* the idols that their parents \add had worshiped\add*.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 So I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among many people groups,
\v 24 because they had rejected and disobeyed all my laws, and because they were treating the Sabbath days like any other dayâ€”and because they were eager to worship the idols that their parents had worshiped.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 I myself also lifted up my hand to swear to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands.
\v 24 I decided to do this since they had not obeyed my decrees, and since they had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths. Their eyes were longing after their fathers' idols.
</usfm>
