====== Acts 11 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "The Gentiles also had received the word of God" ==
In the early church, christians were almost exclusively Jewish. Many Gentiles then started to believe in Jesus. This is what it means to "receive the word of God." 

== "Baptism in the Holy Spirit" ==

Many scholars believe this indicates the Spirit began to indwell them, or live inside their heart, in order to guide them when they believed in Jesus. Others believe this gave them the ability to speak in tongues, in addition to indwelling them, and is an event that occurs after salvation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:believe]] and [[:en:obe:kt:save]])
