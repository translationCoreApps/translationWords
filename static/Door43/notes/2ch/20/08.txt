<usfm>
\v 8 We have lived here and have built a temple for us people to worship you \f + \ft metonymy \f*. We said,
\v 9 "If we experience disasters, either from our enemies attacking us \f + \ft metonymy \f* or from you punishing \f + \ft metonymy \f* us, or if we experience a plague or a famine, we will stand in your presence in front of this temple that is built to honor you \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and we will cry out to you when we are distressed\f + \ft Or: suffering \f*, and you will hear us and will rescue us.
\pi

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Our ancestors lived here and built a temple at which to worship you. At that time they prayed:
\v 9 'If we experience disasters, either from our enemies attacking us, or from disease or hunger, we will assemble at this temple in your presence, for you agreed to be present here. We will plead with you because of the things we are suffering, and you will hear us and will rescue us.'


\pi

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 They lived in it and built you a holy place in it for your name, saying,
\v 9 'If disaster comes on us—the sword, judgment, or disease, or famine—we will stand before this house, and before you (for your name is in this house), and we will cry to you in our affliction, and you will hear us and save us.'
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa judgment \fqb , some ancient and modern versions read \fqa flood \fqb . \f*
