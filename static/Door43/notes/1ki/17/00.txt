== Baal worship ==
Ahab had introduced the worship of Baal, the god people thought brought rain, to Israel. Because of this, God caused a drought. Elijah told Ahab that it would not rain or dew until he, Elijah, said so. Elijah had to hide so Ahab would not kill him for bringing the drought. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]])
