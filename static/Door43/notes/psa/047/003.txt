===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He subdues peoples under us and nations under our feet** - These two phrases are parallel and mean that God enabled Israel to conquer their enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **subdues** - to conquer and place under the authority of another
  * **under us ... under our feet** - The writer speaks of conquering other nations as if it were putting those nations underneath their feet. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He chooses our inheritance for us** - The writer speaks of the land of Israel as if it were an inheritance that God has given the people as a permanent possession. AT: "He chooses this land as an inheritance for us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the glory of Jacob** - Here the word "glory" refers to a source of pride and represents the land that God has given to his people as an inheritance. AT: "the land in which Jacob takes pride" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Jacob whom he loved** - The word "Jacob" refers to the nation of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **God has gone up with a shout** - The writer speaks of God's conquering the nations as if God were a king ascending his throne, which was located in the temple. AT: "God has gone up into the temple as people shouted" (UDB) or "God has ascended to his throne as people shouted" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
