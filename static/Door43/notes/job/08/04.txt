  * [[:en:obe:kt:children]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:sin]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:god]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:almighty]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **for he gave them into the hand of their sins** - Here "hand" represents the power or results of sin. Bildad implies that God killed Job's children because of their sin. AT: "for God caused the consequences of your children's  sins to kill them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **But suppose you diligently sought God and presented your request to the Almighty** - Bildad is saying what would have happened if Job had correctly spoken to God, but Bildad does not believe that Job really did this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **diligently sought God ... presented your request to the Almighty** - These two phrases both refer to Job asking God for help or pleading with God for mercy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **diligently sought God** - "earnestly asked God for help"
