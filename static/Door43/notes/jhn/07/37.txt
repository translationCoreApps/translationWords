<usfm>
\v 37 \add On each of the seven days of the celebration, the high priest poured out some water on the altar in the Temple to remember how God provided water for the people in the desolate area long ago. But the water he poured did not help anyone who was thirsty. So\add* on the last day of the festival, which was the most important day, Jesus stood up \add in the Temple courtyard\add* and said with a loud voice, "Those who are thirsty should come to me to drink \add what I will give them\add*.
\v 38 Just like the Scriptures teach, streams of water shall flow out from the inner beings of those who believe in me, and that water will cause them to live \add eternally\add*."
