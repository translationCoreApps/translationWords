=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The battle against the Philistines ==

Jonathan took his armor bearer to where the Philistines were on the top of the hill. He said God could use a few people just as easily as he could use many people to win his battles. He and his armor bearer started killing the Philistines and suddenly the Philistines began fighting each other or running away. The rest of Israel, who had hidden came, and chased the Philistines. Even though Israel has a king, God is still in control of the nation of Israel.


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===
