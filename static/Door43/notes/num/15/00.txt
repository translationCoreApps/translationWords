====== Numbers 15 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== Purifying the people ==
As the people travel through the wilderness, Yahweh is purifying them. He is doing this so that they are able to enter into the Promised Land. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:purify]] and [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Prostitution ==

The imagery of prostitution is commonly used in Scripture to indicate that Yahweh alone is to be worshiped. The people are compared to the prostitute because a husband is to only have a sexual relationship with his wife. Both the prostitute and the worship of other gods are violations of this exclusive relationship. Many cultures will struggle with this imagery because of a desire to use euphemisms. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
