<usfm>
\v 33 Some people try to hide their sins,
\q2 but I have never done that;

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 33 If, like mankind, I have hidden my sins
\q by hiding my iniquity in my heart,
\q
\v 34 and if I did this because I stood in great fear of the multitude,
\q because the contempt of families terrified me,
\q so that I kept silent and would not go outside, 
\q then bring charges against me!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])

  * **because I stood in great fear of the great multitude, because the contempt of families terrified me** - These mean the same thing. They emphasize that a person may hide his sin because he fears what other people may say. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
