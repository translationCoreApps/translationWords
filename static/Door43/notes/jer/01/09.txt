===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then Yahweh reached out with his hand, touched my mouth** - Possible meanings are 1) this is a metaphor representing Yahweh giving Jeremiah special authority to speak. AT: "Then it was as though Yahweh touched my mouth" (UDB) or 2) Jeremiah was seeing a vision and Yahweh actually did this as a symbolic act of giving Jeremiah authority to speak. AT: "Then Yahweh touched my mouth with his hand" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **I have placed my word in your mouth** - This phrase represents giving Jeremiah his message. AT: "I have given you my message for you to speak to the people" or "I have enabled you to tell the people my message" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * I am appointing you ... to uproot and break down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and plant" - Jeremiah would do these things to various nations by saying that they would happen.
  * **to uproot and break down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and plant** - He would uproot, break down, destroy and overthrow some nations, and he would build and plant other nations. 
  * **to uproot** - God speaks of Jeremiah destroying the nations by what he says as if the nations were plants and he were to pull them up out of the ground. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to destroy and overthrow** - Jeremiah uses these words, which mean almost the same thing, to show that this will certainly happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **to build and plant** - God speaks of Jeremiah causing nations to become strong as if they were a building and he would build them, and as if they were plants and he would plant them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
