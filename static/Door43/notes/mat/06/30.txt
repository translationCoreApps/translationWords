But you are more important to God than wild plants are, and you live much longer\add*.

\v 30 God makes the wild plants very beautiful, but they grow in the field for only a short time. One day they grow, and the next day people will throw them into an oven to burn them. But you are more important to God than wild plants are, and you live much longer. So trust in God, you who have so little faith!
\v 31 So do not worry and say, 'Will we have anything to eat?' or 'Will we have anything to drink?' or 'Will we have clothes to wear?'

\v 30 If God so clothes the grass in the fields, which exists today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith?
\v 31 Therefore do not be anxious and say, 'What will we eat?' or, 'What will we drink?' or, 'What clothes will we wear?'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of "you" and "your" are plural.

  * **so clothes the grass** - This is a metaphor that means God makes the flowers beautiful. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **grass** - If your language has a word that includes "grass" and the word you used for "lilies" in the previous verse, you can use it here. 
  * **is thrown into the oven** - The Jews at that time used grass in their fires to cook their food. This can be stated in active form. AT: "someone throws it into a fire" or "someone burns it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **how much more will he clothe you ... faith?** - Jesus is using a question to teach the people. AT: "he will certainly clothe you ... faith" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you of little faith** - "you who have such little faith." Jesus is scolding the people because they have little faith in God.
  * **Therefore** - "Because of all of this"
