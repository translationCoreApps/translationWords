===== translationNotes: =====

  * **when my sword will have drunk its fill in heaven** - Yahweh describes himself as a warrior bearing a sword. The phrase "drunk its fill" speaks of Yahweh's sword as if it were a person who has eaten and become satisfied. Yahweh uses this imagery to emphasize that there will be a lot of destruction in heaven and to state its completion. AT: "when I am finished destroying things in heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **look** - This word is used here to draw the listener's attention and to have them imagine the things being said. AT: "listen" or "and then" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **it will now come down on Edom, on the people I am setting apart for destruction** - The word "it" refers to Yahweh's sword. This continues the metaphor about Yahweh destroying things with a sword. AT: "I will come to punish the people of Edom, the people whom I have set aside for me to destroy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **on Edom** - Edom refers to the people who live there. AT: "on the people of Edom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The sword of Yahweh is dripping with blood and covered with fat ... of rams** - This speaks of Yahweh killing the people as if he were a priest sacrificing animals. He does this by describing the sword of a priest. AT: "Yahweh sacrifices them as a priest sacrifices animals, whose sword drips with the blood and fat of lambs, goats, and rams" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom** - The words "sacrifice" and "slaughter" may be expressed here as verbs. AT: "For Yahweh will sacrifice many people in Bozrah and kill many people in the land of Edom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Bozrah** - This is an important city in Edom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
