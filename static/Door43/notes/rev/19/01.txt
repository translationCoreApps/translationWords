\v 1 After these things I heard what sounded like a loud voice of a large number of people in heaven saying,
\q "Hallelujah. 
\q Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God.
\q2
\v 2 His judgments are true and just, 
\q for he has judged the great prostitute
\q2 who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality. 
\q He has taken revenge for the blood of his servants, 
\q2 which she herself shed."
