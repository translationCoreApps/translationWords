===== translationNotes: =====

  * **five kings** - "5 kings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Jarmuth ... Lachish ... Eglon** - These are the names of cities. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **They set up their positions against Gibeon** - This means they set up their camp around their city. This was a way of weakening those in the city. It prevented people from escaping the city, and it prevented others from bringing food and water to them in the city.
