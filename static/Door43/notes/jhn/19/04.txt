\v 4 Once more Pilate came outside and said to the crowd, "Look! I am bringing him out to you so that you may know that I do not find that he has done anything for which we should punish him \add anymore\add*."
\v 5 When Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "Look at this \add wretched\add* man!"
\v 6 When the chief priests and Temple guards saw him, they shouted, "Command your soldiers to kill him by nailing him to a cross! Crucify him!" Pilate, \add knowing that they could not legally do it themselves\add*, said to them, "You yourselves take him and nail him to a cross! As for me, I do not find that he has done anything for which we should punish him."

\v 4 Pilate came outside again and said to the people, "Look, I am bringing him out to you so that you can know that I find no reason to punish him."
\v 5 So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, "Look, here is the man!"
\v 6 When the chief priests and temple guards saw him, they shouted, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and crucify him! As for me, I find no reason to punish him."

\v 4 Then Pilate went outside again and said to them, "See, I am bringing him outside to you so that you will know that I find no guilt in him."
\v 5 So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, "Look, here is the man!"
\v 6 When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw Jesus, they cried out and said, "Crucify him, crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I find no guilt in him** - Pilate states this twice to say he does not believe Jesus is not guilty of any crime. He does not want to punish him. AT: "I see no reason to punish him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **crown of thorns ... purple garment** - The crown and the purple robe are things only kings wear. The soldiers dressed Jesus in this manner to mock him. See [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:19:01|19:2]].
