\v 4 While you have struggled against \add being tempted to\add* sin, you have not yet bled \add and died because of resisting evil, as Jesus did\add*.
\v 5 Do not forget \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* these words \add that Solomon spoke to his son, that are the same as God\add* would exhort you as his children:
\q My child, pay attention \f + \ft litotes \f* when the Lord is disciplining you,
\q and do not be discouraged when the Lord punishes you \f + \ft doublet \f*,
\q
\v 6 because it is everyone whom he loves whom the Lord disciplines,
\q and he punishes everyone whom he accepts as his child.

\v 4 While you have struggled against being tempted to sin, you have not yet bled and died because of resisting evil, as Jesus did.
\v 5 Do not forget these words that Solomon spoke to his son, which are the same with which God encourages you as his children:
\q "My son, pay attention when the Lord is disciplining you,
\q and do not be discouraged when the Lord punishes you,
\q
\v 6 because everyone the Lord loves he also disciplines,
\q and he severely corrects everyone he calls his own."

\p
\v 4 You have not yet resisted or struggled against sin to the
point of blood;
\v 5 and you have forgotten the encouragement that instructs you as sons:
\q "My son, do not think lightly of the Lord's discipline,
\q nor grow weary when you are corrected by him."
\q
\v 6 For the Lord disciplines everyone whom he loves,
\q and he punishes every son whom he receives.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The author of Hebrews has been comparing the Christian life to a race.

  * **You have not yet resisted or struggled against sin** - Here "sin" is spoken of as if it were a person whom someone fights in a battle. AT: "You have not yet had to endure attacks of sinners" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **to the point of blood** - Resisting opposition so much that one dies for it is spoken of as if one reached a certain place where he would die. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **of blood** - Here "blood" refers to death. AT: "of death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the encouragement that instructs you** - Old Testament scripture is spoken of as if it were a person who could encourage others. AT: "what God has instructed you in the scriptures to encourage you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **as sons ... My son ... every son** - These refer to everyone who belongs to God whether male or female. AT: "as children ... My child ... every child" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
  * **My son ... corrected by him** - Here the author is quoting from the book of Proverbs in the Old Testament.
  * **do not think lightly of the Lord's discipline, nor grow weary** - This can be stated in positive form. AT: "take it very seriously when the Lord disciplines you, and do not grow weary" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **do not grow weary** - "do not become discouraged"
  * **you are corrected by him** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "he corrects you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **every son whom he receives** - "everyone whom he accepts as his child"
