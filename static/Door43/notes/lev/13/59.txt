  * **mildew in a garment ... made with leather** - Translate these words in the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:13:47|13:47-48]].
  * **so that you may pronounce it** - "so that a priest may declare it"
  * **clean or unclean** - Something that God has declared to be fit for people to touch is spoken of as if it were physically clean and something that God has declared to be unfit for people to touch is spoken of as if it were physically unclean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
