\v 33 The Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* replied, "We are \add wanting to\add* throw stones at you not because you performed a great miracle. Instead, \add we are wanting to do it\add* because you are dishonoring God. You are just a man, but you are saying that you are God!"

\v 32 Jesus said to them, "You have seen me do many good works, things that my Father had told me to do. For which of them are you going to stone me?"
\v 33 The Jewish opponents replied, "We are wanting to take your life, not because you did any good work, but because you, just a man, are insulting God and are making yourself God!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father** - Jesus performed the miracles by the power of God. The word "Father" is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **For which of those works are you stoning me?** - This question uses irony. Jesus knows the Jewish leaders do not want to stone him because he has done good works. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]]) 
  * **The Jews answered him** - The word "Jews" is a synecdoche that represents the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus. AT: "The Jewish opponents replied" or "The Jewish leaders answered him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **making yourself God** - "claiming to be God"
