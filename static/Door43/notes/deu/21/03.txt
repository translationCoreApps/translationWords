\v 3 And the city that is nearest to the killed manâ€”its elders must take a heifer from the herd, one that has never been put to work, that has not borne the yoke.
\v 4 The elders of that city must bring the heifer down to a valley with running water, a valley that has been neither plowed nor sown, and must break the heifer's neck there in the valley.
