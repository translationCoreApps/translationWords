\v 13 When the king heard about that, he sent still another officer with fifty more soldiers. They went to where Elijah was; the officer prostrated himself in front of Elijah and said to him, "Prophet, I plead with you, be kind to me and my fifty soldiers, and do not kill us!
\v 14 We know that two times fire came down from the sky and killed officers and the soldiers with them. So now, please be kind to me!"

\v 13 Yet again the king sent a third group of fifty warriors. This captain went up, fell on his knees before Elijah, and implored him and said to him, "You, man of God, I ask you, let my life and the life of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight.
\v 14 Indeed, fire came down from heaven and consumed the first two captains with their men, but now let my life be precious in your sight."
