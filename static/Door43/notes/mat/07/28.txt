\v 28 When Jesus finished saying all those things, the crowd \add who had heard him was\add* amazed at the \add new\add* teaching that he had taught them.
\v 29 The reason they were amazed was that he was teaching as a person does who has \add his own\add* authority. He was not teaching like the men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws, \add who just repeated what other people had taught them\add*.

\v 28 When Jesus finished teaching all those things, the crowds who had heard him were amazed by how he taught.
\v 29 He taught like a teacher who relies on what he himself knows. He did not teach like those who taught the Jewish laws, who repeated the different things that other men had taught.

\v 28 It came about that when Jesus finished speaking these words, the crowds were astonished by his teaching,
\v 29 for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
