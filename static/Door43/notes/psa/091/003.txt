===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For he will rescue you from the snare of the hunter and from the deadly plague** - The words that have been left out can be put in. AT: "For God will rescue you from the snare of the hunter and he will rescue you from the plagues that can kill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the snare of the hunter** - "from the snare that the hunter has set to catch you"
  * **He will cover you with his wings, and under his wings you will find refuge** - God's protection is here referred to as "wings" which a bird uses to cover its' young from danger. "Cover you with his wings" and "under his wings" mean basically the same thing. AT: "He will keep you safe and protect you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **His trustworthiness is a shield and protection** - God's trustworthiness is here referred to as a "shield" which can protect people who rely on him. AT: "You can trust him to protect you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **protection** - No one knows for sure what this word means. Possible meanings are 1) a small shield strapped to the forearm that soldiers used to defend themselves against arrows and swords or 2) a wall of stones set in a circle inside which soldiers could hide and shoot arrows.
