\v 12 Listen to this carefully: \add You\add* who trust in me will do the \add kinds of\add* miracles \add that I have done\add*. \add Because of what I will do for you\add* (OR\add , Because I will send God's Spirit to you\add*) after I go to my Father, you will be able to do \add miracles\add* that will be greater than \add the ones I have done\add*.
\v 13 And whatever you, using my authority, ask me to do, I will do it, in order that I can show \add you\add* how great \add my\add* Father is.
\v 14 Anything that you ask \add my Father to do, anything that you ask\add* with my \add authority\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, I will do."

<usfm>
\v 12 I am telling you the truth: whoever trusts in me will also do the things that I do. He will do even greater works because I am going to be with the Father.
\v 13 Whatever you ask in my name, that I will do. I will do this in order that everyone might honor the Father and that they might know the Father because of everything that I, his Son, do.
\v 14 If you ask the Father for anything because you belong to me, I will do it.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me will do the works that I do, and he will do greater works than these because I am going to the Father.
\v 13 Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it so that the Father will be glorified in the Son.
\v 14 If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.
