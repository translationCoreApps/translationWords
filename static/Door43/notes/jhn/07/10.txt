===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The setting of the story has changed, Jesus and his brothers are now at the festival.

  * **when his brothers had gone up to the festival** - These "brothers" were the younger brothers of Jesus.
  * **he also went up** - Jerusalem is at a higher elevation than Galilee where Jesus and his brothers were previously.
  * **not publicly but in secret** - These two phrases mean the same thing. The idea is repeated for emphasis. AT: "very secretly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) 
  * **The Jews were looking for him** - Here the word "Jews"is a synecdoche for "the Jewish leaders." The word "him" refers to Jesus. AT: "The Jewish leaders were looking for Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
