====== Proverbs 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Chapter 3 continues a collection of proverbs that ends in chapter nine. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== My Son ==
Occasionally, the author addresses a proverb to "my son." This is not intended to restrict the words of that proverb to only males. Instead, it is simply a form used to pass on advice as a father does to his son.

== Wisdom is feminine ==

You may notice that wisdom is referenced using a feminine pronoun. This is a feature that is carried in from the Hebrew language. This may apply well in your language but if it does not, follow the conventions of your language. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:wise]])
