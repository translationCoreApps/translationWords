====== Zechariah 13 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is written partly in prose and partly in poetry. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 13:7-9, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

Zechariah often speaks of the last days by using the phrase "that day" or "in that day." When referencing a future "day," the translator should be aware that it is possible that the author is speaking about the last days. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lastday]])
