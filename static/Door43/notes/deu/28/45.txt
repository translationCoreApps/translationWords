\v 45 All these curses will come on you and will pursue and overtake you until you are destroyed. This will happen because you did not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, so as to keep his commandments and his regulations that he commanded you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **All these curses will come on you and will pursue and overtake you until you are destroyed** - Moses describes the curses as a person who would attack them by surprise or chase and catch them. AT: "Yahweh will curse you like this in ways that will completely surprise you, and it will be as if he is chasing you and you cannot escape having him curse you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **will come on you ... and overtake you** - Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:28:01|28:2]].
  * **to the voice of Yahweh your God** - Here the words "voice of Yahweh" are a metonym for what Yahweh said. AT: "to what Yahweh your God said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **his commandments and his statutes** - The words "commandments" and "statutes" are a doublet for "all that Yahweh has commanded you to do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
