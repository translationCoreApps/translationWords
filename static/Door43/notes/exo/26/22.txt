===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to tell Moses what the people must do.

  * **These frames must be separate at the bottom, but joined at the top** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Separate these frames at the bottom, but join them at the top" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **silver bases** - These were silver blocks that had a slot in them to keep the frame in place. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:26:19|26:19]].
  * **in all** - "total"
  * **and so on** - This means that what was said about the first two frames should be done for the rest of the frames. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:26:19|26:21]]. AT: "and two bases for each of the rest of the frames" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
