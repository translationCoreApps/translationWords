\v 3 Their children remember these places on the hills. So I will allow your enemies to capture the mountain where you worship and the area around it,

\q2 because of the sins that you people have committed throughout your land, and they will kill you.

<usfm>
\q
\v 3 My mountain in the open country and all your wealth along with all of your treasures,
\q I will give as plunder to others.
\q That is the price of your high places
\q and the sin that is throughout all your territories.

\q
\v 4 You will lose the inheritance that I gave to you.
\q I will enslave you to your enemies in a land that you do not know,
\q for you have ignited a fire in my wrath, which will burn forever."
