\v 3 Hepher's son Zelophehad had no sons, but he had five daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
\v 4 They went to Eleazar the supreme priest, and to Joshua and to the other Israelite leaders. They said, "\add We want you to give us some land, because\add* Yahweh told Moses that he should give to us some land, just like you gave to the men." So Eleazar did what Yahweh had commanded, and he allotted to them some land, just like he allotted to their uncles.

\v 3 Now Zelophehad son of Hepher, a descendant of Gilead, who had been the son of Makir and grandson of Manasseh, had no sons. He had only daughters, and their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
\v 4 These women went to Eleazar (the leader of all the priests), and to Joshua and the other Israelite leaders. They said, "We want you to give us some land, because Yahweh told Moses that he should give to us some land, just as you have given to the men in our tribe." So Eleazar did what Yahweh had commanded: He assigned some land to them, just as he had done for their uncles.
