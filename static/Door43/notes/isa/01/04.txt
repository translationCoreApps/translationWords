===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The words in 1:4-10 were probably spoken by Isaiah.

  * **Nation, sinners** - Possible meanings are 1) Isaiah is saying two different things about them or 2) he is saying only one thing about them, "Nation of sinners" (UDB).
  * **a people weighed down with iniquity** - This compares their many sins to something very heavy that a person might carry. AT: "their sin is like a heavy bag on their shoulders that makes it hard for them to walk" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They have abandoned Yahweh** - "They have turned away from Yahweh" 
  * **they have despised the Holy One of Israel** - "they have rejected the Holy One of Israel" or "they have been disrespectful to the Holy One of Israel" 
  * **they have estranged themselves from him** - "they have separated themselves from him." AT: "they have treated him as a stranger"
