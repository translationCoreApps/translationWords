\v 17 In order to \add help you do that\add*, I have sent\f + \ft Or: will \f* be sending Timothy to you. I love him \add as though he were\add* my son. He serves the Lord faithfully. He will remind you of the way I conduct my life \add as one who\add* has a close relationship with\f + \ft Or: belongs to \f* the Lord. The way I conduct my life is the same as how I teach \add others to live\add* in all the congregations \add to whom I have spoken\add*.


\p
\v 18 Some of you have become proud, thinking that I will not come there \add to rebuke your congregation about what they are doing\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 That is why I sent Timothy to you. I love him, and he is my faithful child. He will remind you of how I live as I am joined to Christ. I teach the same things everywhere we go and in every church we visit. 
\p
\v 18 Some of you have become proud. You live as though I might not come back to you soon.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 That is why I sent you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ, just as I teach them everywhere and in every church.
\v 18 Now some of you have become arrogant, acting as though I were not coming to you.
