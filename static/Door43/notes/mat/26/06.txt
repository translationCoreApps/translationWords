\v 6 Now while Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,
\v 7 as he was reclining at table, a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it upon his head.
\v 8 But when his disciples saw it, they became angry and said, "What is the reason for this waste?
\v 9 This could have been sold for a large amount and given to the poor."
