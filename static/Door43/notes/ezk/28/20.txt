\v 20 Then Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 21 "Son of man, turn toward the city of Sidon, and announce the terrible things that will happen to it.
\v 22 Give the people of Sidon this message from Yahweh the Lord. Tell them:
\q1 'I am your enemy, you people of Sidon.
\q2 By what I do to you,
\q1 I will show you how great I am,
\q2 and you will know that it is Yahweh who punishes you and judges you with justice.
\q2 You will know that I am different from you, and that I will be honored by what I do to you!

\v 20 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 21 "Son of man, set your face against Sidon and prophesy against her.
\v 22 Say, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am against you, Sidon! For I will be glorified in your midst so your people will know that I am Yahweh when I execute justice within you. I will be shown to be holy in you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **set your face against Sidon** - Sidon was far away, so Ezekiel could not see  it, but staring in that direction would be a symbol of harming the people there. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:01|6:2]]. AT: "Turn toward Sidon and stare" or "stare toward Sidon so that the people there will be harmed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **prophesy against** - "prophesy about the bad things that will happen to." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:06|4:7]].
  * **Behold!** - "Look!" or "Listen!" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you!"
  * **I will be glorified in your midst** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will reveal my glory among you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **know that I am Yahweh** - When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]]. AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **when I execute justice within you** - The abstract noun "justice" can be translated using the verb "judge." AT: "when I judge you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **I will be shown to be holy in you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will use you to show you that I am holy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
