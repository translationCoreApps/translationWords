====== Habakkuk 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:1-17, which are extended quotations.

This chapter is arranged in a series of questions and answers between Yahweh and Habakkuk.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Injustice ==

Habakkuk sees great injustice, especially in the defeat of Israel by the Assyrians. He cries out to Yahweh to ask him to put an end to it. He is questioning Yahweh, but he trusts in him. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:unjust]] and [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])

== Chaldeans ==
Yahweh will raise up the Chaldeans to bring justice to the Hebrew people. They will defeat the Assyrians. At this time, the Chaldeans were an insignificant city and people group. This was probably intended to show the power of Yahweh.
