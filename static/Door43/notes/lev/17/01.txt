\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 "Speak to Aaron and to his sons, and to all the people of Israel. Tell them what Yahweh has commanded:
\v 3 'Any man from Israel who kills an ox, lamb, or goat in the camp, or who kills it outside the camp, in order to sacrifice itâ€”
\v 4 if he does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it as a sacrifice to Yahweh before his tabernacle, that man is guilty of bloodshed. He has shed blood, and that man must be cut off from among his people.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **before his tabernacle** - "before Yahweh's tabernacle"
  * **that man must be cut off from among his people** - A person being excluded from his community is spoken of as if he had been cut off from his people, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree. This can be translated in active form. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:07:19|7:20]]. AT: "that person may no longer live among his people" or "you must separate that person from his people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
