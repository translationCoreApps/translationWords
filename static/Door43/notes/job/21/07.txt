===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Job continues speaking to his friends.

  * **Why do wicked people continue to live, become old, and grow mighty in power?** - Job uses this question to show that his friends are wrong to think evil men always suffer. AT: "Wicked people indeed continue to live, become old, and become wealthier." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Their descendants are established with them in their sight ... their offspring are established before their eyes** - This two clauses mean the same thing and emphasize that this is true. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **in their sight ... before their eyes** - These phrases mean the same thing because "eyes" refers to sight. Wicked people get to watch their descendants grow strong and wealthy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Their houses** - Here "houses" refers to the family members that lives in them. AT: "Their families" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **rod of God** - This refers to God's punishment. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
