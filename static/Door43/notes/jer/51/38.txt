\v 38 The people of Babylon will all roar like young lions;

\q1
\v 39 But while they are extremely hungry,
\q2 I will prepare a different kind of feast for them.
\q1 I will cause them to drink wine until they are very drunk,
\q2 with the result that they will fall asleep.
\q1 But they will never wake up from that sleep!
\q1
\v 40 I will bring them down to a place where they will be slaughtered,

<usfm>
\q
\v 38 The Babylonians will roar together like young lions. They will growl like lion cubs.
\q
\v 39 When they become hot with greed, I will make a feast for them; I will make them drunk so they become happy,
\q and then sleep an unending sleep and not wake up—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q
\v 40 I will send them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with male goats.
