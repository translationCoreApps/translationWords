\v 41 So, they made an image \add out of gold that looked like\add* a calf. Then they sacrificed \add animals and offered other things\add* to \add honor\add* that idol, and they sang and danced to honor the idol that they themselves had made.
\v 42 So God rejected them. He abandoned them to worship the sun, moon and stars in the sky. This agrees with the words that one of the prophets wrote that God said,
\q You Israelite \add people\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, when you \add repeatedly\add* killed animals and offered them as sacrifices during those forty years \add that you were\add* in the desert, you \add most certainly\add* were not offering them to me!\f + \ft Or: what makes you think that you were offering them to me? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 41 So they made an image that looked like a calf. Then they offered sacrifices to honor that idol, and they sang and danced because of what they themselves had made.
\v 42 So God stopped correcting them. He abandoned them to worship the sun, moon and stars in the sky. This agrees with the words that one of the prophets wrote: 
\q God said, 'You Israelite people, when you repeatedly killed animals and offered them as sacrifices during those forty years that you were in the wilderness, were you offering them to me?

\v 41 So they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced because of the work of their hands.
\v 42 But God turned and gave them up to worship the stars in the sky, as it is written in the book of the prophets,
\q 'Did you offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices
\q for forty years in the wilderness, house of Israel?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Stephen's quotation here is from the prophet Amos.

  * **they made a calf** - Stephen's audience knew the calf they made was a statue. AT: "they made a statue that looked like a calf" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a calf ... the idol ... the work of their hands** - These phrases all refer to the same statue of the calf.
  * **God turned** - "God turned away." This action expresses that God was not pleased with the people and no longer helped them. AT: "God stopped correcting them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **gave them up** - "abandoned them" (UDB)
  * **the stars in the sky** - Possible meanings for the original phrase are 1) the stars only or 2) the sun, moon, and stars.
  * **the book of the prophets** - This was apparently a collection of the writings of several of the Old Testament prophets into one scroll. It would also have included the writings of Amo.
  * **Did you offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices ... Israel?** - God asked this question to show Israel they did not worship Him with their sacrifices. AT: "You did not honor me when you offered slain beasts and sacrifices ... Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **house of Israel** - This refers to the whole nation of Israel. AT: "all you Israelites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
