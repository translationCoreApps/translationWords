===== translationNotes: =====


  * **that man must be cut off from his people** - A person being excluded from his community is spoken of as if he had been cut off from his people, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree. This can be translated in active form. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:07:19|7:20]]. AT: "that person may no longer live among his people" or "you must separate that person from his people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
