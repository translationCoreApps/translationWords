===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues telling the Levites and the people what they must say. 

  * **May the man be cursed** - This may be stated in active form. AT: "May Yahweh curse the man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **uses force to take away the justice due to a foreigner ... widow** - Moses speaks of justice as if it were a physical object that a stronger person can violently pull away from a weaker person. Your language might have one word that means "use force to take away." AT: "treats a foreigner ... widow unfairly" Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:24:17|24:17]].
  * **fatherless** - There are children whose parents have both died and do not have relatives to care for them.
  * **widow** - This means a woman whose husband has died and has no children to care for her in her old age.
