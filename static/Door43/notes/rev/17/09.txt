\v 9 People need to think wisely to understand this: The seven heads of the beast on which the woman sits symbolize the seven hills of the city that the woman represents. They also symbolize seven rulers.
\v 10 Five of those rulers have died. One is still alive. The seventh ruler has not yet come. When he comes, he must remain for only a short time.

<usfm>
\v 9 This calls for a mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman is seated. 
\v 10 They are also seven kings. Five kings have fallen, one exists, and the other has not yet come; when he comes, he can remain only for a little while.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The angel continues speaking. Here he explains the meaning of the seven heads of the beast that the woman is riding.

  * **This calls for** - "This makes it necessary to have"
  * **This calls for a mind that has wisdom** - The abstract nouns "mind" and "wisdom" can be expressed with "think" and "wise" or "wisely." Why a wise mind is needed can be stated clearly. AT "A wise mind is needed in order to understand this" or "You need to think wisely in order to understand this" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **The seven heads are seven hills** - Here "are" means "stands for," "represents."
  * **Five kings have fallen** - The angel speaks of dying as falling. AT: "Five kings have died"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **one exists** - "one is king now" or "one king is alive now"
  * **the other has not yet come; when he comes** - Not having existed yet is spoken of as not yet having come. AT: "the other has not yet become king; when he becomes king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he can remain only for a little while** - The angel speaks of someone continuing to be king as if he were remaining in a place. AT: "he can be king only for a little while" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
