\v 28 But none of the rest of us who were sitting there knew why Jesus said that to him.
\v 29 Since Judas took care of the money \add people gave us to help us\add*, some thought Jesus was telling him to \add go and\add* buy some things we needed for the \add Passover\add* celebration. \add Some thought he was telling him\add* to give some money to poor people.
\v 30 As soon as Judas had eaten the bread, he left. It was dark \add outside\add*, and it was dark \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add in his soul, too\add*.

\v 28 No one else at the table knew why Jesus had said that to him.
\v 29 Some thought that because Judas had the money bag, Jesus was telling him to go and buy some things needed for the Passover Festival. Others thought Jesus was telling Judas to give something to the poor.
\v 30 After receiving the bread, immediately Judas went out. It was night.

\v 28 Now no one who was laying at the table knew why he said this to him.
\v 29 Some thought that, since Judas had the money bag, Jesus said to him, "Buy what we need to have for the feast," or that he should give something to the poor.
\v 30 After Judas received the bread, he went out immediately. It was night.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **that he should give something to the poor** - You can translate this as a direct quote: "Go and give some money to the poor."
  * **he went out immediately. It was night** - John seems to draw attention here to the fact that Judas will do his evil or "dark" deed in the darkness of the night. AT: "he went out immediately into the dark night" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background|Background Information]])
