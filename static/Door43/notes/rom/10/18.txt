\v 18 But if someone said to those people, "Of course the Israelites have heard this message," I would say, "Yes, indeed! It is like what the scriptures say:
\q
"The people living all over the world have seen the creation, and what it proves about who God isâ€”even the people living in the most remote places in the world have understood this!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But I say, "Did they not hear?" Yes, most certainly** - Paul uses a question for emphasis. You can translate this as a statement. AT: "But, I say the Jews certainly have heard the message about Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **Their sound has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world** - Both of these statements mean basically the same thing and Paul uses them for emphasis. The word "their" refers to the sun, moon, and stars. Here they are described as human messengers that tell people about God. This refers to how their existence shows God's power and glory. You can make explicit that Paul is quoting Scripture here. AT: "As the Scriptures record, 'The sun, moon, and the stars are proof of God's power and glory, and everyone in the world sees them and knows the truth about God'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
