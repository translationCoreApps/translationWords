AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **Wail** - "Cry out with grief." This command is to Egypt and the nations around Egypt.
  * **Woe is the coming day** - This exclamation expresses the fear that people would feel about a certain day when terrible and frightening things will happen. AT: "Oh that day" or "Oh, what a frightening day is coming" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclamations]])
  * **The day is near** - "That day is soon" or "It will soon be that day"
