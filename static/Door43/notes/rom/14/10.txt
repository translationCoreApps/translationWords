<usfm>
\v 10 It is disgraceful that you who obey certain rules say that God will punish your fellow believers who do not obey them. For God will judge each one of us.
\v 11 We know this because it is written in the scriptures:
\q "Everyone will bow down before me! 
\q And everyone will praise me."

\v 10 But you, why do you judge your brother? And you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.
\v 11 For it is written,
\q "As I live," says the Lord, "to me every knee will bend,
\q and every tongue will give praise to God."

===== translationNotes: ===== 

  * **why do you judge your brother? And you, why do you despise your brother?** - By using these questions, Paul is demonstrating how he might need to scold individuals among his readers.  AT: "it is wrong for you to judge your brother, and it is wrong for you to despise your brother!" or "stop judging and despising your brother!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **brother** - Here this means a fellow Christian, male or female.
  * **For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God** - The "judgment seat" refers to God's authority to judge. AT: "For God will judge us all" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **For it is written** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "For someone has written in the Scriptures:" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **As I live** - This phrase is used to start an oath or solemn promise. AT: "You can be certain that this is true" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **to me every knee will bend, and every tongue will give praise to God** - Paul uses the words "knee" and "tongue" to refer to the whole person. Also, the Lord uses the word "God" to refer to himself. AT: "every person will bow and give praise to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
