===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Verses 6-12 repeat for a second time and give more detail about how Noah went into the ark with his family and the animals in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:07:01|7:1-5]]. This is not a new event.

  * **clean animals** - These were animals that God allowed people to eat and to give to him as sacrifices.
  * **unclean animals** - These were animals that God did not allow people to eat or to give to him as sacrifices.
  * **two by two** - The animals entered the boat in pairs of one male and one female.
  * **It came about that** - This phrase is used here to mark an important event in the story: the start of the flood. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **after the seven days** - "after seven days" or "seven days later"
  * **the waters of the flood came upon the earth** - The implicit information, "it started to rain" can be made explicit (UDB). AT: "it started to rain and the waters of the flood came upon the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
