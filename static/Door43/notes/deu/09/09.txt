\v 9 When I went up the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that Yahweh made with you, I stayed on the mountain for forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water.
\v 10 Yahweh gave to me the two tablets of stone written with his finger; on them was written everything just like all the words that Yahweh announced to you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire on the day of the assembly.

  * **General Information:** - Moses is reminding the people of Israel what happened in the past.

  * **the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that Yahweh made with you** - Here the second phrase clarifies that "the tablets of stone" are the ones on which God wrote the Ten Commandments. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **forty days and forty nights** - "40 days and 40 nights" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **on them was written everything just like all the words that Yahweh announced to you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh wrote on them the same words he had said to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Yahweh announced ... out of the middle of the fire** - It was as if Yahweh were a person standing in the middle of a fire and speaking with a loud voice.
  * **on the day of the assembly** - The abstract noun "assembly" can be expressed as the verb "gather together." AT: "on the day when you Israelites all came and met together in one place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
