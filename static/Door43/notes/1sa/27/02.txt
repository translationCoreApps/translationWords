\v 2 David arose and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish son of Maoch, the king of Gath.
\v 3 David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each man with his own household, and David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
\v 4 Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, so he looked for him no longer.
