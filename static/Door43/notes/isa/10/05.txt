===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Woe** - This word marks the beginning of God's announcement about a severe punishment against Assyria.
  * **the Assyrian** - This refers to the king of Assyria.
  * **the club of my anger, the rod by whom I wield my fury** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. Yahweh compares the king of Assyria to a weapon a person holds in his hand and hits other people with. It emphasizes that the king of Assyria and his army are a tool that Yahweh uses to punish Israel. AT: "who will be like a weapon in my hands that I will use to show my anger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I send him ... I order him** - The word "him" here also refers to the king of Assyria. But it does not mean God is only sending the king; he is sending with him the army of Assyria. AT: "I send the army of Assyria ... I order them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **against an arrogant nation and against the people who bear my overflowing wrath** - "to attack a nation full of proud people who have made me very angry"
  * **who bear my overflowing wrath** - Yahweh speaks of his wrath as if it were more liquid than a container could hold; "the people" are trying to carry this container, but it is heavy, and Yahweh keeps pouring liquid in even after it starts to spill out. AT: "at whom I continue to be angry even after I have punished them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to take the spoil** - "to take everything they have"
  * **to take the prey** - to take the people like prey. See how you translated "prey" in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:05:29|5:29]].
  * **trample them like mud** - Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh compares the army of Assyria attacking Israel to people stomping through mud who do not care what happens to the mud. AT: "trample them until they become like mud" or 2) the people are stomping on other people so they are lying in the mud and unable to rise. This is a metaphor for completely defeating them. AT: "completely defeat them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
