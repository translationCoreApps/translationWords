\v 3 I myself will gather the remnant of my flock from all of the lands where I have driven them, and I will return them to a grazing place, where they will be fruitful and increase.

  * **to a grazing place** - Yahweh refers to the land of Israel as if it were good pasture for his people. This good pasture is a metonym for provision for their needs. AT: "to good pasture" or "to where all their needs will be supplied" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they will be fruitful and increase** - The word "increase" explains how they will be "fruitful." AT: "they will increase greatly in number." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **I will raise up** - "I will appoint"
  * **they will no longer fear or be shattered** - The words "be shattered" mean that someone has caused them to be afraid and mean basically the same thing as "fear." This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one will me them afraid anymore" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **None of them** - "None of my people"
