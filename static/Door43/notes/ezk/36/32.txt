====== Ezekiel 36:32-34 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 But I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that I want you to know that it is not for your sake that I will do those things. You Israelite people ought to be ashamed of your behavior.
\p
\v 33 This is also what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: At the time that I forgive you for all the sins that you have committed, I will enable you to live in your towns again and to build houses where there are now only ruins.
\v 34 People who walk through your country will see that your land is again cultivated instead of being desolate\f + \ft Or: having nothing growing in them \f*.
</usfm>

<usfm>
\v 32 But I, the Lord Yahweh, tell you this: It is not for your sake that I will do those things. You Israelite people ought to be ashamed of your behavior.
\p
\v 33 I, the Lord Yahweh, also tell you this: At the time that I cleanse you from all the sins that you have committed, I will enable you to live in your cities again and to build houses where there are now only ruins.
\v 34 People who walk through your country will see that you are once again cultivating your land, and that your people are living in it again.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 32 I am not doing this for your sake—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—let this be known to you. So be ashamed and disgraced because of your ways, house of Israel.
\v 33 The Lord Yahweh says this: On the day that I purify you from all your iniquity, I will cause you to inhabit the cities and to rebuild the ruined places.
\v 34 For you will plow the ruined land until it is no longer a ruin before the eyes of all who pass by.
