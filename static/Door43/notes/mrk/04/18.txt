\v 18 \add Some people are like\add* the \add soil that had roots of\add* thorny weeds in it. \add Although\add* those people hear \add God's\add* message,
\v 19 they desire to be rich, and they desire to own many other things. So they worry \add only\add* about material things. The result is that they forget \add God's\add* message and they do not do \add the things that God wants them to do\add*.
\v 20 \add But some people\add* are like the good soil. They hear \add God's\add* message and they accept it \add and they believe\add* it, \add they do the things that God wants them to do. They are like the good plants that produced\add* 30, 60 or 100 \add grains\add*."

\v 18 Some people are like the soil that has thorny weeds in it. Those people hear God's message,
\v 19 but they desire to be rich and they want to own many other things. So they only worry about what they have and they forget God's message and they do not do the things that God wants them to do.
\v 20 But some people are like the good soil. They hear God's message and they accept it and they believe it, and they do the things that God wants them to do. They are like the good plants that produced thirty, sixty, or one hundred grains."

\v 18 And others are the ones sown among the thorns. They hear the word,
\v 19 but the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires of other things, enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
\v 20 Then there are those who are the ones sown in the good soil. They hear the word and receive it and produce fruit: some thirty, and some sixty, and some a hundred."
