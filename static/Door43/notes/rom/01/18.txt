\v 18 God in heaven makes it clear that he is angry with all who show no respect for him and who do wicked things. He shows them that they deserve for him to punish them. Because they do wicked things, they also keep other people from knowing what is true about God.


\p
\v 19 All non-Jews can clearly know what God is like, because God himself has revealed this to everyone.
