====== Introduction to Haggai ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of Haggai ===

  - The Temple must be completed if Yahweh's blessings are going to be restored to the nation (1:1–15)
  - The smaller and less impressive Temple will be more glorious than the first (2:1–9)
  - Disobedience causes failure in worship; sinful selfishness leads to crop failures (2:10–19)
  - A promise made to Zerubbabel (2:20–23) 


=== What is the Book of Haggai about? ===

The purpose of Haggai was to encourage the returning exiles to construct a second temple in Jerusalem. His short prophetic ministry lasted only a few months, but his words of encouragement were so effective that the work was quickly completed. The people's disobedience was the reason for economic hardship and crop failures. Obedience to the law of Yahweh could solve these problems. Also, he accused the Levites of failing in their service to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]])

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 
Translators may decide to translate this traditional title "The book of Haggai" in a way that is more clear to the readers. They may decide to call it, "The sayings of Haggai." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Haggai? ===

The prophet Haggai wrote this book, but very little is known about him. The book is written after the exiles returned from Babylon and occurs during the reign of Darius I in Persia. The prophecies of Haggai probably all occurred during a 4 month timeframe. Haggai lived at the same time as the prophet Zechariah.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What does "consider your ways" mean? ===

The Lord tells the people to "consider your ways" several times in this book. This is a call to a renewed relationship with Yahweh; it probably seeks a renewal of the covenant. The people responded positively to this command. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]])
