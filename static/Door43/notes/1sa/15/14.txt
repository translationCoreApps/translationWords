\v 14 Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?"
\v 15 Saul replied, "They have brought them from the Amalekites. For the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God. The rest we have completely destroyed."
\v 16 Then Samuel said to Saul, "Wait, and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me tonight." Saul said to him, "Speak!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Samuel questions why Saul did not utterly destroyed the Amalekites.

  * **bleating of sheep ... lowing of the oxen** - These are the sounds that these animals make. Your language may have different terms for these.
  * **in my ears ... that I hear** - These two phrases mean the same thing. Here "in my ears" refers to hearing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **They have brought ... the people spared** - The word "they" and the phrase "the people" here both represent Saul's army. Saul is blaming the people rather than himself.
  * **to sacrifice to Yahweh your God** - Saul is arguing that animals for sacrifice were an exception to Yahweh's command to destroy everything. 
  * **Yahweh your God** - Saul here does not describe Samuel's God as his own God.
