  * **whether uncleanness of man, or of unclean beast** - Here "man" means humans in general. AT: "whether of a person or a beast"
  * **or of some unclean and disgusting thing** - "or of some unclean thing that disgusts Yahweh"
  * **that person must be cut off from his people** - A person being excluded from his community is spoken of as if he had been cut off from his people, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree. This can be translated in active form. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:07:19|7:20]].
