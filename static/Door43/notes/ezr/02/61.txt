\v 62 The people in that group searched in the documents that had the names of the ancestors of all the clans, but these men's names were not found. So they were not permitted do the work that priests did.
\v 63 The governor told them that they would need to ask a priest to consult Yahweh by casting the sacred lots\f + \ft Or: throwing the sacred stones that had been marked \f*, to determine if those men were truly Israelites. When the priests did that, \add if the stones showed that those men were Israelites\add*, they would be permitted to eat the shares of the sacrifices that were given to the priests.

\v 61 The descendants of the priests in this group included people belonging to Habaiah's clan, Hakkoz's clan, and Barzillai's clan. Barzillai had married a woman who was a descendant of Barzillai from the region of Gilead, and he had taken for himself the name of his father-in-law's clan.

\v 61 Also, from the priest's descendants: the descendants of Habaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai (who took his wife from the daughters of Barzillai of Gilead and was called by their name).
\v 62 They searched for their genealogical records, but could not find them, so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean. 
\v 63 So the governor told them they must not eat any of the holy sacrifices until a priest with Urim and Thummim approved.

  * **their genealogical records** - the records that told who their ancestors were
  * **could not find them** - "could not find their names in the records of the priests"
  * **they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean** - This can be translated in active form. The abstract noun "priesthood" can be translated as the verb "work as priests."
