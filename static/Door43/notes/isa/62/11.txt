===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Look** - "Take notice!"
  * **the ends of the earth** - The places on the earth that are very far away are spoken of as if they were the places where the earth ends. This phrase also forms a merism and refers to everywhere in between the ends. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:40:27|40:28]]. AT "the farthest places of the earth" or "the entire earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **the daughter of Zion** - "Daughter" represents the people of Jerusalem (Zion). See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:07|1:8]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **See, his reward is with him, and his recompense is going before him** - These clauses represent the same idea for emphasis. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:40:09|40:10]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **you will be called** - This can be stated actively, "they will call you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
