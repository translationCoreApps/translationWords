\v 27 All people must die once, and after that God will judge them for their sins.
\v 28 Likewise, when Christ died, God offered him once to be a sacrifice, to punish him in the place of the many people who had sinned. He will come to earth a second time, not in order to sacrifice himself again for those who have sinned, but in order to save us who wait for him and expect him to come.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 Every person is destined to die once, and after that comes judgment.
\v 28 In the same way, Christ also, who was offered once to take away the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but for the salvation of those who are waiting patiently for him.

  * **Christ also, who was offered** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Christ also, who offered himself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **to take away the sins** - The act of making us innocent rather than guilty for our sins is spoken of as if our sins were physical objects that Christ could carry away from us. AT: "so that God would forgive the sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the sins** - Here "sins" mean the guilt that people have before God because of the sins they committed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
