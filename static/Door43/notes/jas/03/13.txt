\v 13 If any of you thinks that you are wise and know much, you should always act in a good way to show people that your good deeds are the result of your being truly wise. Being wise helps us to act gently toward others.
\v 14 But if you are very envious of other people and lie against them and do them wrong, you should not pretend that you are wise. By boasting like that you are saying that what is true is actually false.

\v 13 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let that person show a good life by his works in the humility of wisdom.
\v 14 But if you have bitter jealousy and ambition in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth.

  * **Who is wise and understanding among you?** - James uses this question to teach his audience about proper behavior. The words "wise" and "understanding" are similar.

  * **show a good life** - One's course of action is spoken of as if it were an object that someone could show to others. AT: "demonstrate living a good life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **by his works in the humility of wisdom** - "with his good deeds and humility that come from having true wisdom"
  * **have bitter jealousy and ambition in your heart** - The word "heart" refers to emotions or thoughts. AT: "strongly desire what other people own and experience, and you seek your own interests regardless of other people's interests" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **bitter jealousy and ambition** - These emotions are spoken of as if they were objects that could exist in someone's inner self. Ambition in this context is the desire to succeed better than other people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
