===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 The Jews rejected the good news about Christ and now God treats them as his enemies. But that has helped you non-Jews. But because they are the people whom God chose, God still loves them because of what he promised to do for their ancestors.
\v 29 He still loves them, because he never changed his mind about what he has promised to give them, and about how he has called them to be his own people.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 On the one hand concerning the gospel, they are enemies on your behalf. On the other hand according to God's choice, they are beloved because of the ancestors.
\v 29 For the gifts and the call of God are unchangeable.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **On the one hand ... On the other hand** - This is a pair of phrases used to compare two different facts about a subject. Paul uses these phrases to explain that God has rejected the Jews, but he also still loves them. 
  * **concerning the gospel** - You can make explicit that God treated the Jews as enemies because they rejected Jesus. AT: "because the Jews rejected the good news about Christ" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **they are enemies on your behalf** - God's love for the Gentiles was so great that his love for the Jews seemed like hatred in comparison. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **they are beloved because of the ancestors** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God still loves them because of what he promised to do for their ancestors" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **For the gifts and the call of God are unchangeable** - Paul speaks of the spiritual and material blessings that God promised to give his people as if they were gifts. The call of God refers to the fact that God called the Jews to be his people. AT: "For God never changed his mind about what he has promised to give them, and about how he has called them to be his people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
