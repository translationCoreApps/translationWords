===== translationNotes: =====

  * **one hundred eighty years** - "180 years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Isaac breathed his last and died** - "Isaac took his last breath and died." The phrases "breathed his last" and "died" mean basically the same thing. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:25:07|25:08]]. AT: "Isaac died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **breathed his last** - This is a polite way of saying a person died. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:25:07|25:8]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **was gathered to his ancestors** - This means that after Isaac died, his soul went to the same place as his relatives who died before him. This can be stated in active form. AT: "he joined his family members who had already died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **an old man full of days** - The phrases "old man" and "full of days" mean basically the same thing. They emphasize that Isaac lived a very long time. AT: "after he had lived a very long time and was very old" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
