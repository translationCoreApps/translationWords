====== Ezekiel 09:9-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 He replied, "The sins of the people \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Israel and Judah are extremely great. People are murdered \f + \ft metonymy \f* everywhere \add in this country\add*, and this city is full of people who act unjustly. They say, 'Yahweh has abandoned this country, and he does not see \add what we are doing\add*.'
\v 10 So I will not pity them or act mercifully toward them. I will do to them the evil things that they have done to other people."
\p
\v 11 Then the man wearing the linen robe returned, saying, "I have done what you commanded me to do."

\v 9 He replied, "The sins of the people are numerous and severe! There is murder everywhere in this country, and this city is full of people who act unjustly. They say, 'Yahweh has abandoned this country, and he does not see what we are doing.'
\v 10 So I will not pity them or act mercifully toward them. I will do to them the evil things that they have done to other people."
\p
\v 11 Then the man wearing the linen robe returned, saying, "I have done what you commanded me to do."

\p
\v 9 He said to me, "The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is full of blood and the city full of perversions, since they say, 'Yahweh has forgotten the land,' and 'Yahweh does not see!'
\v 10 So then, my eye will not look with compassion, and I will not spare them. I will instead bring it all on their heads."
\v 11 Behold! The man dressed in linen who had the scribe's equipment by his side came back. He reported and said, "I have done all that you have commanded."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **exceedingly great** - "very great"
  * **The land is full of blood** - The word "blood" is a metonym for murder. AT: "the land is full of murder" or "All over the land people are killing innocent people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **the city full of perversions** - The city is spoken of as if it were a container, and perversion is spoken of as if it were something that could fill that container. The abstract noun "perversions" can be written as a verb. AT: "all the people in the city do wicked things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **my eye will not look with compassion** - "I will not look on them with compassion" or "I will not be compassionate to them." The eye here refers to how he regards people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
