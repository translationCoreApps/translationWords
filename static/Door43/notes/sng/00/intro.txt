===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How many characters are in The Song of Solomon? ===

The two main characters in this book are the man and the woman, who love each other. There is also the group of women to whom the young woman speaks, and who also themselves make comments, but that group of women might be imaginary, existing only in the young woman's mind.

Some interpreters believe there may be more characters than these, but this is not certain. The interpretation adopted by the ULB and UDB recognize only the man, the woman, and the group of women.

=== How should one translate The Song of Solomon if the readers will view certain terms as course, vulgar or improper? ===

There are many images or forms appearing in the Song of Solomon that, when translated, may be considered improper. The translator should try to avoid offensive language if possible, by using expressions that will not cause offence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])

=== How do I translate metaphors in this book? ==
There are many metaphors in this book. These metaphors are often ambiguous. If they have sexual meanings, metaphors describing feelings or emotions are often used as euphemisms in order to avoid offense by veiling their meaning. However, since their meanings are often very unclear, ambiguity in translation is encouraged. You might choose to translate the words as they are written in order to avoid committing to a specific meaning or defining their precise intended meaning.
