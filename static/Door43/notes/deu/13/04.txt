<usfm>
\v 4 You will walk after Yahweh your God, honor him, keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and you will worship him and cling to him.
\v 5 That prophet or that dreamer of dreams will be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and who redeemed you out of the house of bondage. That prophet wants to draw you out of the way in which Yahweh your God commanded you to walk. So put away the evil from among you.
