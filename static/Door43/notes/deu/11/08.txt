===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **possess the land** - "take the land"
  * **where you are going over to possess it** - The phrase "are going over" is used because the people of Israel will have to cross the Jordan River to enter into Canaan.
  * **prolong your days** - Long days are a metaphor for a long life. Translate these words as they are in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:04:25|4:26]]. AT: "be able to live a long time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a land flowing with milk and honey** - This is an idiom. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:06:03|6:3]]. AT: "a land where plenty of milk and honey flow" or "a land that is excellent for cattle and farming" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
