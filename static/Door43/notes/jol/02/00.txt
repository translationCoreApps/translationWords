====== Joel 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter continues in the poetic form with striking imagery of armies and soldiers. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Locusts ==

This book starts very dramatically with the imagery of the locusts and the devastation they produce. There are five different kinds of locusts that appear to come and progressively destroy the vegetation including the crops, vineyards and even the trees of Israel.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

This chapter uses simile to a great extent as Joel tries to describe this army. (See:  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])

== Metaphor ==
The drought, or severe lack of rain, Joel describes is probably be a real drought. It might also be a picture of either enemy invaders or of Yahweh himself coming to punish his people and the other nations. Translators should translate simply, presenting the scenes of locusts and drought as Joel describes them, and not worry about the various possible meanings. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
