\v 38 Pilate said to him, "\add How can anyone know\add* what the truth is?"
\p After he said that, he went outside and talked to the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* again. He said to them, "I do not find that he has done anything at all for which I should punish him.
\v 39 But you \add Jews\add* customarily, \add every year\add* during the Passover \add celebration\add*, ask me to release for you \add someone who is in prison\add*. So would you like for me to release for you the \add man who you\add* Jews \add say is your\add* king?"
\v 40 They shouted again, "No, do not \add release\add* this man! Instead, \add release\add* Barrabas!" But Barrabas was \add in prison because he was\add* a revolutionist!

\v 38 Pilate asked him, "What is true?"
\p After Pilate asked that question, he went outside and talked to the Jewish leaders again. He said to them, "I find he has broken no law.
\v 39 However, you Jews have a custom where every year during the Passover Festival, you ask me to release one man who is in prison. So would you like for me to release to you the King of the Jews?"
\v 40 They shouted again, "No, do not release this man, but release Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.

\v 38 Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, "I find no guilt in this man.
\v 39 But you have the custom that I release one person to you at the Passover. So do you want me to release the King of the Jews to you?"
\v 40 Then they cried out again and said, "Not this man, but Barabbas." Now Barabbas was a robber.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **What is truth?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to reflect Pilate's belief that no one really knows what truth is. The irony here is that Jesus is the truth. AT: "No one can know what is true!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]]) 
  * **the Jews** - Here "Jews" is a synecdoche that refers to the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Not this man, but Barabbas** - This is an ellipsis. You can add the implied words. AT: "No! Do not release this man! Release Barabbas instead!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]]) 
  * **Now Barabbas was a robber** - Here John provides background information about Barabbas. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
