===== translationNotes: =====

  * **So the men whom ... complain against Moses** - The information in [[:en:bible:notes:num:14:36|14:36-37]] has been rearranged so its meaning can be more easily understood. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])
  * **died by the plague before Yahweh** - "died by the plague in his presence." Because it says that they died in his presence, it is implied that he caused them to die. AT: "died in Yahweh's presence by the plague that he caused" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
