=== Structure and formatting ===

The section on King Rehoboam continues in this chapter.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Strengthening their defenses ==
Rehoboam strengthened the defenses of Judah. Without the help of the northern tribes, the kingdom of Judah did not really have much power to defend itself from outside attacks. Therefore, Rehoboam felt it necessary to strengthen Judah's military defenses.

== Israel ==
When the author speaks about Israel, he is now referring almost exclusively to the northern kingdom of Israel and not the united nation of Israel.
