===== translationNotes: =====

  * **If you return, Israel** - "If you will come back to me, people of Israel or "If you will change your behavior, people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **then it should be to me that you return** - Possible meanings are that 1) this is a repetition of the first phrase: "if you will return to me," AT: "then come back to me" or "then start worshiping me again," or 2) this is a command, "then return to me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **If you remove your detestable things from before me** - This phrase refers to idols as things that deserve strong hatred. AT: "Remove your disgusting idols from my presence" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **do not wander from me again** - "Wander" is a metaphor for being unfaithful. AT: "remain faithful to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Plow your own ground, and do not sow among thorns** - Yahweh tells the people to prepare their lives like a farmer prepares the ground for planting. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
