== Reuben and Gad's inheritance ==

Reuben and Gad were given the land conquered east of the Jordan River because they had many sheep, goats and cattle and this land had good pastures. It would have been sinful because they had not yet entered into the Promised Land, except they promised to help the rest of the tribes fight for their land. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]], [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland]] and [[:en:obe:kt:promise]])
