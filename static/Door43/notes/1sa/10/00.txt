====== 1 Samuel 10 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

This is the first chapter about King Saul.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== Saul as the New King ==
Samuel told Saul God had chosen him to be king and on the way home he would meet some prophets. Saul would then begin prophesying and God would give him the Holy Spirit to help him to know what to do. Samuel told everyone to come to Mizpah where he told them; God had chosen Saul to be their king. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:holyspirit]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical question ==
  
This chapter uses Rhetorical Questions to express different ideas: to state a fact ("Has not Yahweh anointed you to be a ruler over his inheritance?"), to express surprise ("And who is their father?"), to say he is someone very special ("Do you see the man that Yahweh has chosen?") and to express contempt ("How can this man save us?"). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

== Idiom ==

Samuel frequently uses idioms when prophesying: "going to God" meaning going to worship God, "take it from their hands" meaning accept their gift. "rush upon you" meaning control you, "hand finds to do" meaning what you think you should do, "God is with you" meaning God is directing you, "another heart" meaning a different way of thinking, "came to pass" meaning happened, "before Yahweh" meaning to do work for Yahweh, "hearts God had touched" meaning God had made them want to help Saul. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
