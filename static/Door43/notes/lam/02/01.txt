===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - A new poem begins. The writer of Lamentations uses many different ways to express that the people of Israel have lost God's favor. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] â€‹and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 

  * **cloud of his anger** - Possible meanings are 1) God is threatening to harm the people of Jerusalem or 2) God has already harmed the people (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]). 
  * **daughter of Zion ... daughter of Judah** - These are poetic names for Jerusalem, which is spoken of here as if it were a woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])

  * **day of his anger** - a general period of time, not one 24-hour day AT: "at the time when he displayed his anger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
