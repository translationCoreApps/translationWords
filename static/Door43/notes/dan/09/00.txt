====== Daniel 09 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Daniel told the future ==
Gabriel told Daniel a prophecy that Jerusalem would be rebuilt. Then later an anointed person would be killed and the worship at the temple stopped. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:anoint]] and [[:en:obe:kt:temple]])

== The unusual expression of numbers in 9:24-26 ==

This passage uses the expressions "Seventy sevens of years," "seven sevens and sixty-two sevens," and "sixty-two sevens of years" to denote ""490 years," "49 years and then 434 years," and "434 years" respectively. The original language uses the idea of "week" to express the idea of a group of sevens, but these numbers are clearly meant to denote years, not weeks. Most translators should use the ways normal in their languages to express these numbers.
