\v 4 One day a very large crowd was gathering, because people were traveling to see Jesus from many different towns. Then he told them this story:
\v 5 "A man went out to his field to plant some grain seeds. As he was scattering them over the soil, some of the seeds fell on the hard pathway. Then people walked on those seeds, and birds ate them.
\v 6 Some of the seeds fell on rocky ground which had very little soil. Therefore, as soon as the seeds grew, the plants dried up because there was no moisture.

\v 4 While a large crowd of people was gathering, and people were coming to him from town after town, he told a parable:
\v 5 "A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell beside the road and it was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.
\v 6 Some fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.
