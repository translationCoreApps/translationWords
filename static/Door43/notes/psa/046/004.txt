===== translationNotes: =====

  * **There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God happy** - "There is a river whose streams make the city of God happy." The imagery of a running river symbolizes peace and prosperity for the city of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **make the city of God happy** - The phrase "city of God" refers to Jerusalem, which the writer speaks of as a person who can be happy. AT: "make the people who live in Jerusalem happy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High** - This phrase describes the "city of God." The plural "tabernacles" intensifies the idea that this is God's special dwelling place. AT: "the holy place where the Most High lives" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **in the middle of her; she will not be moved ... help her** - The words "her" and "she" refer to the "city of God."
  * **she will not be moved** - Here, the word "moved" is the same word translated as "shaken" in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:046:001|v. 2]]. The writer speaks of the destruction of Jerusalem by armies as if an earthquake were to destroy it. This can be stated in active form. AT: "nothing will be able destroy her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
