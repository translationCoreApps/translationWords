\v 10 It will be sharp in order that I can slaughter many people with it;
\q2 I will polish it so that it will flash like lightning.
\q1 The people of Judah will not celebrate about their king's scepter,

\q2 and the right person will then hold it in his hand.
\q1 Now it is sharp; now it shines,
\q2 ready for the killer to use!
