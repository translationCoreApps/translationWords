  * **I am not angry** - It is understood that Yahweh is not angry with his people any longer. AT: "I am not angry with my people any longer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **that there were briers and thorns** - The enemies of the people of Israel are spoken of as if they were briers and thorns growing in the vineyard. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **I would march against them; I would burn them all together** - Here Isaiah combines different images to speak of Yahweh's enemies. He speaks of them as if they are briers and thorns but also as soldiers in an army. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **unless they grasp my protection** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "protection" is expressed as the verb "protect." AT: "unless they ask me to protect them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **and make peace with me; let them make peace with me** - "and they ask to live peacefully with me; I want them to live peacefully with me"
