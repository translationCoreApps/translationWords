===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I will put them in good pastures; the high mountains of Israel will be their grazing places. They will lie down there in good places for grazing, in abundant pastures, and they will graze on the mountains of Israel.
\v 15 I myself will shepherd my flock, and I myself will make them lie down—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—
\v 16 I will seek the lost and restore the outcast. I will bind up the broken sheep and heal the sick sheep but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd with justice.
