\v 5 Look, I have taught you laws and decrees, as Yahweh my God had commanded me, that you should do so in the midst of the land which you are going into in order to possess it.
\v 6 Therefore keep them and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear about all these statutes and say, 'Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Look** - "Pay attention"
  * **that you should do so in the midst of the land** - "that you should obey them when you live in the land"
  * **keep them and do them** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that they are to obey them. AT: "obey them carefully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples** - The words "wisdom" and "understanding" are metonyms for the belief of the peoples that the Israelites were wise and understood what was important. AT: "this is what will show the peoples your wisdom and your understanding" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in the sight of the peoples** - The metonym "in the sight of" means "in the opinion of." This means the other peoples will consider the people of Israel to be wise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **this great nation is a wise and understanding people** - The word "nation" is a metonym for the people of that nation. AT: "the people of this great nation are wise and understanding" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
