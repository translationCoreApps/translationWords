== Uzzah the leper ==
Uzzah was powerful when he followed Yahweh. When he entered the temple to burn incense like a priest; God made him a leper. A leper could not properly worship Yahweh because they were always unclean. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:temple]], [[:en:obe:kt:priest]] and [[:en:obe:kt:unclean]])
