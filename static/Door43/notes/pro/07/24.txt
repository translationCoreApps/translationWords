===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - This is to focus the attention of the speaker's sons on the conclusion of this lesson.
  * **May your heart not turn aside onto her paths** - Here "ways" means the paths that a person chooses to walk on. It represents the person's behavior, the things that he decides to do in life. AT: "Make your heart stay far away from the ways of the adulterous woman" or "Do not let your heart want to do the things that the adulterous woman does" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your heart** - Here "heart" represents what a person desires. AT: "you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **do not be led astray onto her paths** - This means the same as the sentence before it. It strengthens the first warning. AT:  "do not leave the right path in order to go on her paths" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
