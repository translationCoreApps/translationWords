<usfm>
\v 6 So, \add because God's Spirit lives in us\add*, we are always confident \add that God will give us new bodies\add*. We know that as long as we live in our bodies here on \add earth\add*, we are not yet \add living together\add* with the Lord \add Jesus in heaven\add*.
\v 7 While we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* live \add here, we\add* do not have our \add new bodies, but we are\add* trusting \add that God will give them to us\add*.
\v 8 \add As I said\add*, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are confident \add that he will give us new bodies\add*. We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* would much prefer to leave these bodies \add in which we are now living\add*, and be with the Lord \add Jesus in our\add* home in \add heaven\add*.

<usfm>
\v 6 So you should always be certain that as long as we live in our bodies on the earth, we are away from Lord, who is in heaven
\v 7 (we live our lives by trusting in him, and not by trusting in what we can see).
\v 8 Because we have put our trust in him, we would much rather give up our present bodies so we could be at home with the Lord.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Therefore always be confident. Be aware that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord.
\v 7 For we walk by faith, not by sight.
\v 8 So we have confidence. We would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Because believers will have a new body and have the Holy Spirit as a pledge, Paul reminds them to live by faith that they may please the Lord. He continues by reminding them to persuade others because 1) believers will appear at the judgment seat of Christ and 2) because of love for Christ who died for believers.

  * **while we are at home in the body** - Paul speaks of the physical body as if it were a place where a person dwells. AT: "while we are living in this earthly body" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **we are away from the Lord** - "we are not at home with the Lord" or "we are not in heaven with the Lord"
  * **we walk by faith, not by sight** - "we live according to faith, not according to what we see"
  * **We would rather be away from the body** - Here the word "body" refers to the physical body.
  * **at home with the Lord** - "at home with the Lord in heaven"
