===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the house of Yahweh** - The "house" was actually a tent, but it would be best to translate "house" here.
  * **my son** - Eli was not Samuel's true father. Eli speaks as if he were Samuel's father to show Samuel that he is not angry but that Samuel needs to answer him. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:01:05|1:6]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
