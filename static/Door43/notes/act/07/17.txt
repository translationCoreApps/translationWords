\v 17 As the time of the promise approached, the promise that God had made to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
\v 18 until there arose another king over Egypt, a king who did not know about Joseph.
\v 19 This same king deceived our people and treated our fathers so badly, they had forced our fathers to expose their infants to danger, so they would not be kept alive.
