===== translationNotes: =====

  * **his command runs very swiftly** - The writer describes God's command as if it were a messenger that moves quickly to deliver God's message. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **He makes the snow like wool, he scatters the frost like ashes** - These emphasize how easy it is for him to do these things. He covers the ground with snow as easily as a person covers something with a wool blanket. And, he removes the frost as easily as the wind blows ashes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
