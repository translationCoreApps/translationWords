===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Now the writer writes the words that Yahweh spoke.

  * **harden your heart** - "become stubborn"
  * **Meribah, ... Massah** - These are places in the desert that Moses named because the Israelites rebelled against God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **tested me ... tried me** - These two phrases are both metaphors for the people seeing how much evil they could do before Yahweh would punish them. The phrases say basically the same thing and can be combined. AT: "tested me" or "wanted to see if they could do evil things without my punishing them ... tested whether I would continue to be patient with them" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **my deeds** - "the amazing things I had done"
