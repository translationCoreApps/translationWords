\v 13 Now it is to you non-Jews that I am saying what follows. I am the one who is the apostle to non-Jews such as you, and I highly value this work that God appointed me to do.
\v 14 But I also hope that by my labors I will make my fellow Jews jealous, with the result that some of them will believe and thus be saved.

\v 13 And now I am speaking to you Gentiles. As long as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry.
\v 14 Perhaps I will provoke to jealousy those who are of my own flesh. Perhaps we will save some of them.
