====== John 15:5-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 I am \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a vine. You are \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the branches. All those who have a close relationship with me and with whom I have a close relationship will \add do much that pleases God, like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add a vine that\add* bears much fruit. \add Remember that\add* you can do nothing \f + \ft hyperbole \f* \add that truly pleases God\add* without my \add help\add*.
\v 6 \add A gardener cuts off and\add* throws away useless branches. Then, after they dry up, \add he\add* picks them up and throws them into a fire and burns them \f + \ft simile \f*. Similarly, everyone who does not remain having a close relationship with me, \add God\add* will get rid of.
\v 7 If you remain having a close relationship with me and you keep \add living in accordance with\add* my message, you can ask \add God to do\add* anything for you, and he will do it.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain joined to me and I remain joined to you, you will bear much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing at all.
\v 6 Everyone who does not stay joined to me and draw his life from me will be thrown away like a dead branch. Those branches are gathered together and thrown into the fire and burned.
\v 7 If you stay joined to me and live by my message, you can ask God for anything, and he will do it.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 I am the vine, you are the branches. He who remains in me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for without me you can do nothing.
\v 6 If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown away like a branch and dries up, and they gather the branches and throw them into the fire, and they are burned up.
\v 7 If you remain in me, and if my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I am the vine, you are the branches** - The "vine" is a metaphor that represents Jesus. The "branches" is a metaphor that represent those who trust in Jesus and belong to him. AT: "I am like a vine, and you are like branches that are attached to the vine."(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He who remains in me and I in him** - Here Jesus implies that his followers are joined to him as he is joined to God. AT: "He who stays joined to me, as I stay joined to my Father" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **he bears much fruit** - The implied metaphor here is the fruitful branch that represents the believer who pleases God. Just as a branch that is attached to the vine will bear much fruit, those who stay joined to Jesus will do many things that please God. AT: "you will bear much fruit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he is thrown away like a branch** - Here the implied metaphor is the unfruitful branch that represents those who do not stay joined to Jesus. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "the vinedresser throws him away like a branch" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]).
  * **they are burned up** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "the fire burns them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **ask whatever you wish** - Jesus implies that believers must ask God to answer their prayers. AT: "ask God whatever you wish" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **it will be done for you** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "he will do it for you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
