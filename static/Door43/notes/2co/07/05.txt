\v 5 Now \add I will write more about what I was saying about Titus\add*. When I \add left Troas and\add* came \add here to\add* Macedonia \add province\add*, I still did not get rest for my body. Everywhere we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* went, \add people were constantly\add* causing us trouble. \add And not only were\add* people \add constantly causing us\add* trouble, but I was greatly concerned \add about you all\add*.
\v 6 But God, who always encourages his people when they are discouraged, encouraged us by \add sending\add* Titus back to us.
\v 7 I was encouraged by\add seeing\add* Titus\add , but when I heard how\add* you had encouraged him, that encouraged me even more. He told me how much you wanted \add to see me. He told me\add* that you were very sorry \add that you had made me so unhappy. He also told me\add* that you are very eager for me \add to continue to serve as your apostle. When Titus told me those things\add*, I was very, very happy.

\v 5 When we came to you in Macedonia, we were exhausted. We had troubles on every sideâ€”we faced hardships that other people caused, and we feared many things.
\v 6 But God always comforts us when we are discouraged, and he comforted us at that time by sending Titus to be with us.
\v 7 Titus's coming was a great comfort, but you also comforted him when you were with him. When he came to us, he told us of your deep love for us, and how you were sorry for us in our sufferings. He also told us about how you were deeply concerned for me, so I rejoiced even more because of you.

\v 5 When we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest. Instead, we were troubled in every way by conflicts on the outside and fears on the inside.
\v 6 But God, who comforts the discouraged, comforted us by the arrival of Titus.
\v 7 It was not only by his arrival that God comforted us. It was also by the comfort that Titus had received from you. He told us of your great affection, your sorrow, and your deep concern for me. So I rejoiced even more.
