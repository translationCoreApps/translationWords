\v 1 Obeying what Yahweh commanded, all the Israelite people moved from the wilderness of Sin. They traveled from one place to another. They camped at a place called Rephidim, but there was no water there for the people to drink.
\v 2 So the people complained to Moses again, saying, "Give us water to drink!" Moses replied to them, "Why are you speaking against me? And why are you trying to test whether Yahweh has the power to give you what you need?"
\v 3 But the people were very thirsty, and they continued to complain to Moses. They were saying, "Why did you bring us up out of Egypt? Did you bring us here to cause us and our children and animals to die from thirst?"

\v 1 The whole community of the Israelites journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, following Yahweh's instructions. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
\v 2 So the people blamed Moses for their situation and said, "Give us water to drink." Moses said, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?"
\v 3 The people were very thirsty, and they complained against Moses. They said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt? To kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **wilderness of Sin** - The word "Sin" here is the Hebrew name of the wilderness. It is not the English word "sin." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:16:01|16:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  * **Rephidim** - This means "the resting place," a place to rest on long journeys through the wilderness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?** - Moses uses these questions to scold the people. AT: "You should not quarrel with me! You should not test Yahweh!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **To kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?** - The people use this question to accuse Moses of wanting to kill them. AT: "You only brought us out here to kill us and our children and cattle by not letting us have any water to drink!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
