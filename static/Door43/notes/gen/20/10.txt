\v 10 Abimelech asked Abraham, "What was your reason for doing this?"
\v 11 Abraham replied, "I said that because I thought, 'They will certainly not respect God in this place. If they don't respect God, they will not respect relationships with others. \add If I say she is my sister, they will try to pay me a bride price\add* to get her. But if I say she is my wife, they will kill me to get her.'
\v 12 Besides, she really \add can be considered\add* my sister, because she is the daughter of my father, although she is not the daughter of my mother. She is the daughter of another woman, and I married her.

\v 10 Why did you do this?"
\v 11 Abraham replied, "I said that she was my sister because I thought, 'The people in this place certainly do not respect God. Certainly they do whatever wrong things they wish. So they will kill me to get my wife.'
\v 12 Besides, Sarah really can be considered my sister, because she is the daughter of my father, although she is not the daughter of my mother. She is the daughter of another woman, and I married her.

\v 10 Abimelech said to Abraham, "What prompted you to do this thing?"
\v 11 Abraham said, "Because I thought, 'Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'
\v 12 Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
