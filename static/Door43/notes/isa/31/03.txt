===== translationNotes: =====

  * **When Yahweh reaches out with his hand** - The term "hand" is often used in reference to God's power and action. AT: "When Yahweh uses his power against them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **both the one who helps will stumble, and the one who is helped will fall** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Stumbling and falling are metaphors of failing. This can be stated in active form. AT: "these two things will happen: I will destroy Egypt, who helps you, and I will destroy you, whom Egypt helps" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **the one who is helped** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the one who is seeking help" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
