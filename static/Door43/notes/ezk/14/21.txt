===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to cut off both man and beast from her** - Yahweh speaks of killing people and animals as if it were cutting them off, like a person would cut a branch from a tree. The word "her" refers to Jerusalem. AT: "to kill both man and beast in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
