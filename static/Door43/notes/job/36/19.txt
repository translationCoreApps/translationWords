\v 19 Can your wealth benefit you, so that you will not be in distress,
\q or can all the force of your strength help you?

\v 20 Do not desire the night, to commit sin against others,
\q when peoples are cut off in their place.
\q

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Can your wealth benefit you ... can all the force of your strength help you?** - Elihu asks these questions to emphasize that money and power will not be able to help Job if he acts unjustly. AT: "Your wealth cannot benefit you ... all the force of your strength cannot help you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **all the force of your strength** - "all of your great strength" or "all of your mighty efforts"
  * **when peoples are cut off in their place** - Possible meanings are 1) that "peoples" refers to people in general and "cut off in their place" is a metaphor for oppressing others by dragging them away from their homes. AT: "when people drag others away from their homes" or 2) that "peoples" represents nations and "cut off in their place" is a metaphor for nations being destroyed. AT: "when nations will perish" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you are being tested by suffering** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God is testing you by making you suffer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
