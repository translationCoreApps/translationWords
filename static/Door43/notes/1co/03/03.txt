====== 1 Corinthians 03:3-5 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 3 because you are still controlled by your self-directed nature. Some of you are jealous and quarreling. That shows that your self-directed nature is controlling you!\f + \ft Or: Does not that prove your self-directed nature is controlling you? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* It shows that \add you are acting like\add* unbelievers act. \v 4 By some of you saying, "I am \add loyal to\add* Paul," and others saying, "I am \add loyal to\add* Apollos," you show that \add you are acting like\add* unbelievers.\f + \ft Or: does not it show that \add you are acting like\add* unbelievers? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\p \v 5 \add So what you really ought to think about\add* Apollos and me \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* is that we(dl) are merely men who serve God. As a result of our \add telling you the message about Christ\add*, you trusted in him. Both of us\add (dl)\add* are merely doing the work that the Lord appointed us to do. </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 3 I say this because you are still acting as unbelievers even though you are Christians. I know you are not ready because many of you are jealous and quarreling with each other, and you are judging things just as if you were still unbelievers. \v 4 Some of you say you are following what I, Paul, have taught; others say they are following what Apollos has taught. You are acting the way unbelievers act. \p \v 5 Compared to the great work that God has done in your lives, Apollos is not important. Neither is Paul important. We are both servants, and we serve the same God in the ways that he has assigned to us. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 3 For you are still fleshly. For where jealousy and strife exist among you, are you not living according to the flesh, and are you not walking by human standards? \v 4 For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another says, "I follow Apollos," are you not living as human beings? \v 5 Who then is Apollos? Who is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, to each of whom the Lord gave tasks. </usfm>
