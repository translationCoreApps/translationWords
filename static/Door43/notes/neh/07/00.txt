====== Nehemiah 07 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Genealogy ==

The people who returned from Persia were counted according to their families. Nehemiah ensured that those who lived in Jerusalem had a completely Jewish ancestry.

== Different lists ==
This list is paralleled in [[:en:bible:notes:ezr:02:01|Ezra 2]]. The lists do contain some differences in numbers. This is probably due to the timing of their counting. They were likely counted at different times.
