\v 3 But the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and ask them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?
\v 4 Therefore Yahweh says, "You will not come down from the bed to where you have gone up; instead, you will certainly die."'" Then Elijah left.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh** - This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. See the translationWord page about Yahweh concerning how to translate this.
  * **the Tishbite** - This refers to someone from the city of Tishbe. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?** - This rhetorical question is asked as a rebuke for consulting Baal Zebub. This may be written as a statement. This is irony because they are definitely aware of the God of Israel. AT: "You fools! You know there is a God in Israel, but you were acting as though you did not know when you sent men to consult Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **consult with Baal Zebub** - The word "consult" means to get the opinion of someone about a question. 
  * **Therefore Yahweh says** - This is Yahweh's message to King Ahaziah. AT: "Therefore Yahweh says to King Ahaziah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **You will not come down from the bed to where you have gone up** - When King Ahaziah was injured, he was placed in a bed. Yahweh said that he will never become well and be able to get out of the bed. AT: "You will not recover and you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
