====== 1 Timothy 01:3-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 \add I urge you now\add*, just like I urged you when I was going to Macedonia \add province\add*, that you remain there in Ephesus \add city\add*. Stay there so that you may command certain persons \add who teach other believers\add* that they not teach false \add doctrines\f + \ft Or: teachings \f*\add*.
\v 4 And tell people to not continually give their attention to stories \add that tell about our ancestors\add*, stories in which there are genealogies\f + \ft Or: lists of our ancestors' names \f* that \add seem to be\add* endless. \add You must command your congregation not to think that these stories are valuable\add*, because \add whenever people think\add* that, they \add just\add* start arguing about things uselessly, instead of \add teaching\add* God's plan, which \add is concerned with\add* what we believe \f + \ft Or: which \add we know because\add* we trust \add in Christ\add* \f*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 The reason that I urged you to remain in Ephesus while I traveled to Macedonia was so that you would command certain men not to teach what is different from what we teach.
\v 4 And command them not to give their time and attention to old useless stories and lists of ancestors that people never stop thinking about. These things only cause people to argue with each other, but do not help them to know God's plan to save usâ€”a plan that we believe by faith.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 3 As I urged you to do when I was leaving for Macedonia, remain in Ephesus so that you can command certain people not to teach a different doctrine.
\v 4 Neither should they pay attention to stories and endless genealogies. These cause arguments rather than helping the plan of God, which is by faith.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul encourages Timothy to reject the wrong use of the law and use good teaching from God. 
  * **General Information:** - The word "you" in this letter is singular and refers to Timothy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **As I urged you** - "As I pleaded with you" or "As I asked you very strongly"
  * **remain in Ephesus** - "wait for me there in the city of Ephesus"
  * **a different doctrine** - The implied information can be stated explicitly. AT: "a different doctrine from what we teach" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Neither should they pay attention** - The understood information can be stated clearly. AT: "And I also want you to command them not to pay attention" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **to stories** - These may have been stories about their ancestors.
  * **endless genealogies** - Paul uses "endless" to emphasize that the genealogies are very long. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **genealogies** - "lists of ancestors." A genealogy is the written or verbal record of a person's parents and ancestors. These were very important in Israel, as they established which tribe one was included in the people of Israel. 
  * **These cause arguments** - "These make people angrily disagree." The people debated about stories and genealogies about which no one could know the truth for certain.
  * **rather than helping the plan of God, which is by faith** - Possible meanings are 1) "rather than helping us to understand God's plan to save us, which we learn by faith" or 2) "rather than helping us to do God's work, which we do by faith."
