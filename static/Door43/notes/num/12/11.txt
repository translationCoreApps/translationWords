===== translationNotes: =====

  * **do not hold this sin against us** - To hold people's sin against them is to say that they are guilty for their sin. Here it represents punishing them for their sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Please do not let her be like a dead newborn whose flesh is half consumed** - Miriam's leprosy would cause her body to decay until she died. The flesh being decayed is spoken of as if it were eaten. AT: "Please do not let her be like a dead newborn baby whose flesh is half decayed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
