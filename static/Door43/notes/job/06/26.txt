===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do you plan to ignore my words, treating the words of a desperate man like the wind?** - Job uses this rhetorical question to scold his friends. He compares his words to the wind to explain that his friends act like his words are empty and useless. AT: "You ignore my words! I am a desperate man, and you treat me words as if they are as useless as the wind." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Do you** - "You" is in second person plural form. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **you cast lots for a fatherless child** - "you would even gamble to win an orphan"
  * **you cast lots ... haggle over your friend** - Here "you" and "your" are in second person plural form. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **and haggle over your friend like merchandise** - This compares how the man would sell his friend to how a person sells merchandise or wares. AT: "bargain to sell your friend for money!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
