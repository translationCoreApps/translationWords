===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues David's song to Yahweh. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Then the water channels appeared ... breath of his nostrils** - When Yahweh shouted in his attack against David's enemies, it is compared to his power to create upheaval in the deepest parts of the ocean and the earth. This shows his great power and fierce anger. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the foundations ... were exposed** - This extreme turbulence was caused by Yahweh's anger.
