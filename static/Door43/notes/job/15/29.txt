====== Job 15:29-30 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 But they will not remain rich very long;
\q2 everything that they own will be taken from them,
\q2 and even their shadow will disappear \add from the earth\add*.
\q1
\v 30 They will not escape from the darkness \add of death\add*;
\q2 they will be like trees whose branches are burned by fire
\q2 and whose blossoms are blown away by the wind.
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 But they will not remain rich very long;
\q2 Others will take everything that they own,
\q2 and even their shadows will disappear from the earth.
\q1
\v 30 They will not escape from the darkness of death;
\q2 they will be like trees whose branches burn up.
\q2 When God gives the command, they will die.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 29 He will not be rich; his wealth will not last;
\q not even his shadow will last on the earth.
\q
\v 30 He will not depart out of darkness;
\f + \ft Several modern versions leave out \fqa He will not depart out of darkness \fqb , because they believe that this expression was mistakenly copied from 15:22. \f*
\q a flame will dry up his stalks;
\q at the breath of God's mouth he will go away.
\f + \ft The Hebrew text has \fqa He will go away by the breath of his mouth \fqb , which some modern versions, including the ULB and UDB, interpret as meaning the breath of God's mouth. However, other modern versions follow an ancient Greek reading, \fqa his flower will fall with the wind \fqb . \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He will not be rich; his wealth will not last** - These two phrases express the same thought and are used together to emphasize that the wicked will not be wealthy. AT: "he will be poor; all his money will disappear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **not even his shadow will last on the earth** - This repeats the idea that all the possessions of the wicked will disappear. Other translations may read: "nor will his possessions spread out on the earth" or "nor will his grain bend down to the ground"
  * **He will not depart out of darkness** - Darkness here represents death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **a flame will dry up his stalks** - Here the flame represents God's judgment and the drying up of his stalks represents either the fact that his possessions disappear, or that he will die. AT: "God will take everything he owns away, like a fire dries out the moist branches of a tree" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the breath of God's mouth** - AT: "God's breath" or "God's judgment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he will go away** - This probably means that he will die (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
