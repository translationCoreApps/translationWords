\v 8 I desire that in every place  \add where believers worship\add*, the men who pray publicly \f + \ft metonymy \f* should be men who are not practicing sin. When they pray, they should not be angry  \add with anyone\add* and they should not doubt  \add that God will answer\add* their prayers \f + \ft Or: should not quarrel with anyone \f*.
\v 9  \add I would like that\add* the clothing that women wear be modest and sensible\f + \ft Or: proper and appropriate \f* \f + \ft doublet \f*. I want them to not fix their hair in fancy, Or: elaborate ways, nor wear gold  \add jewelry\add*, nor pearls, nor expensive clothing  \add in order that they may make themselves attractive\add*.
\v 10 Instead, they should be doing things that women who claim to\f + \ft Or: say that they \f* worship God should do; that is, they should be doing good deeds.

<usfm>
\v 8 Therefore, I want men everywhere to pray and to lift up their hands to God in a way that he will accept. Believers should not pray to show anger or doubt about God.
\v 9 I also want the women to dress themselves carefully. They should control themselves so that they do not dress to show themselves off to others. Instead of braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing,
\v 10 women should dress themselves in what is right for women who do good works and who say that they honor God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul finishes his instructions on prayer then gives some special instructions for women.

  * **I want men in every place to pray and to lift up holy hands** - Here "holy hands" means the entire person is holy. AT: "I want men in every place who are holy to lift up their hands and pray" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **men in every place** - "the males in all places" or "the males everywhere." Here the word "men" refers specifically to males.
  * **lift up holy hands** - It was a normal posture for people to raise their hands while praying.
  * **with modesty and self-control** - Both of these words mean basically the same thing. Paul is emphasizing that women should wear clothes that are appropriate and do not attract improper attention from men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **They should not have braided hair** - During Paul's time, many Roman women braided their hair to make themselves attractive. Braiding is only one way a woman can give undue attention to her hair. If braided hair is unknown, it can be stated in a more general way. AT: "They should not have fancy hairstyles" or "They should not have elaborate hairstyle that attract attention" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **pearls** - These are beautiful and valuable white balls that people use as jewelry. They are formed inside the shell of a certain kind of small animal that lives in the ocean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **who profess godliness through good works** - "who want to honor God by the good things they do"
