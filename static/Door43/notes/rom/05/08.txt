\v 8 Nevertheless, as for God, the way he showed us that he loves us is that Christ died for us while we were still rebelling against God.
\v 9 So it is even more certain that Christ will save us from God's anger about sin since we are right with God because Christ died for us and shed his blood for our sins.

<usfm>
\v 8 But God proves his own love toward us, because while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
\v 9 Much more, then, now that we are justified by his blood, we will be saved by it from the wrath of God.
