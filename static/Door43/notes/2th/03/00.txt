====== 2 Thessalonians 03 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Idleness and Laziness ==
In Thessalonica, there apparently was a problem with people in their church who were able to work but refused to do so. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== What should you do if "your brother sins"? ==

In this chapter, Paul teaches it is important for Christians to live in a way that honors God. Christians should also encourage one another and hold each other accountable for their actions. The church is also responsible for encouraging believers to repent if they sin. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:repent]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])
