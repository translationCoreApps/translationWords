===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **to the voice of Yahweh your God** - Here the metonym "voice of Yahweh" refers to what he says. AT: "to what Yahweh your God says" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **so as to keep** - "and obey"
  * **set you above** - Moses speaks of being important or being great as if it were being physically higher, as on a higher hill. AT: "make you more important than" or "make you greater than"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **All these blessings will come on you and overtake you** - Moses describes the blessings as a person who would attack them by surprise or chase and catch them. AT: "Yahweh will bless you like this in ways that will completely surprise you, and it will be as if you cannot escape having him bless you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
