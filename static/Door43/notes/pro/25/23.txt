===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 When wind blows from the north, it will certainly rain;
\q2 it is just as certain that someone who tells secrets about others will make people angry.
\q1
\v 24 It is better to live alone in the corner of a housetop
\q2 than inside a house with a wife who always wants to argue with you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 23 As surely as the north wind brings rain,
\q so a tongue that tells secrets will result in angry faces.
\q
\v 24 It is better to live on a corner of the roof
\q than in a house shared with a quarreling wife.

  * **the north wind** - In Israel, wind from the north often brought rain. Translators are free to substitute different kinds of wind for the same effect, for example, "a cold wind."
  * **a tongue that tells secrets** - Some versions read "someone who tells secrets."
  * **result in angry faces** - The face is a metonym for the person. AT: "makes other people so angry you can see it in their faces" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a corner of the roof** - Houses in those days had flat roofs. Ancient Israelites spent much time on their roofs, where it was often cooler than inside the house, and sometimes people would build a shelter large enough for a person to sleep in on one corner of the roof. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a quarreling wife** - a wife who often argues or complains
