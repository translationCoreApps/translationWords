<usfm>
\v 8 Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah will be destroyed,

\q1 and they refuse to obey him.
\q2 They rebel against him.
\q1
\v 9 They even show on their faces that \add they oppose Yahweh\add*.
\q1 They are proud about their sins,
\q2 like the people of Sodom were \add long ago\add*;
\q1 they do not try to hide their sins.
\q1 \add Because of their sins\add*, terrible things will happen to them,

<usfm>
\v 8 The people in Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah have disobeyed God,
\q2 because everything that the people do and say there opposes Yahweh,
\q2 the powerful and glorious one,
\q1 and they refuse to obey him.
\q2 They rebel against him.
\q1
\v 9 They even show on their faces that they oppose Yahweh.
\q1 They are proud about their sins,
\q2 like the people of Sodom were long ago;
\q1 they do not try to hide their sins; they talk about them.
\q1 Because of their sins, terrible things will certainly happen to them.

\v 8 For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen,
