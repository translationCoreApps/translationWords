  * **The rest of them were killed by the sword that came out of the mouth of the one who rode on the horse** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The rider of the horse killed the remainder of the beast's armies with the sword that extended from his mouth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the sword that came out of the mouth** - The sword blade was sticking out of his mouth. The sword itself was not in motion. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:01:14|1:16]].
