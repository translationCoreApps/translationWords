====== Judges 15 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The account of Samson continues in this chapter. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 15:16, which is an important quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Samson's strength ==

The Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon Samson. This meant God gave Samson extraordinary strength. Samson's power is the power of Yahweh himself and he enacted the judgment of God on the Philistines. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:holyspirit]] and [[:en:obe:kt:judge]])
