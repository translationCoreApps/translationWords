\v 6 The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
\f + \ft Some versions have \fqa Diphath \fqa* instead of \fqa Riphath \fqa* . However, \fqa Diphath \fqa* was probably a mispelling. Many ancient copies correct it to \fqa Riphath \fqa* in order to make it agree with the same name in Gen. 10:2. \f*
\v 7 The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
