<usfm>
\v 34 Yahweh also said to Moses, "Have an expert perfumer take equal parts of several sweet spices: stacte—a resin from certain gum plants, onycha—from certain shellfish or mollusks, galbanum—another kind of gum resin, and pure frankincense—yet another sort of gum resin.
\v 35 Have him mix them together to make some perfume and add some salt to keep it pure and special for me.
\v 36 Have him beat some of it into a fine powder. Then I want you to take some of it into the sacred tent and sprinkle it in front of the sacred chest. You all must consider this incense to be completely reserved for me.

\v 34 Yahweh said to Moses, "Take spices—stacte, onycha, and galbanum—sweet spices along with pure frankincense, each in equal amounts.
\v 35 Make it into the form of incense, blended by a perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and set apart.
\v 36 You will grind it into a very fine mixture. Put part of it in front of the ark of the covenant decrees, which is in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you. You will regard it as very holy to me.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to tell Moses what to do. Yahweh gives the commands only to Moses: all instances of "you" are singular. However, the words "blended by a perfumer" might mean that Moses could have the perfumer take the spices, blend them, grind them, and give them to Moses so Moses could put part of the mixture in front of the ark, as in UDB.

  * **stacte, onycha, and galbanum** - These are spices. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **Make it into the form of incense, blended by a perfumer** - The phrase with "blended" can be translated in active form. AT: "Make it into the form of incense that a perfumer has blended" or "A perfumer must blend it into a kind of incense" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **blended by a perfumer** - Possible meanings are 1) Moses was to have a perfumer do the work or 2) Moses was to do the work himself the way a perfumer would do it. See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:30:22|30:25]]. 
  * **You will grind it** - "You will crush it." Here "you" refers to Moses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **You will regard** - Here "you" refers to Moses and all the people and so is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
