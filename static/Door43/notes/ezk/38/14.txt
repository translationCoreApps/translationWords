\v 14 Therefore, you human, prophesy about Gog and say to him, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: At that time, when my people of Israel are living safely, you will certainly think about that.
\v 15 So you will come from your place far north \add of Israel\add*, with the armies of many other nations, all riding horses, a huge army.
\v 16 You will march toward my Israelite people, and your soldiers will cover the land like a huge cloud. Gog, I will bring your army to attack the country that belongs to me, but \add what I do\add* for you will show the people of other nations that I am holy.

\v 14 Therefore, Son of man, take my message about Gog and say to him, 'This is what the Lord Yahweh says: At that time, when my people of Israel are living safely, you will certainly think about them.
\v 15 You will come from your place far north of Israel, with the armies of many other nations, all riding horses, a huge army.
\v 16 You will march toward my Israelite people, and your soldiers will cover the land like a huge cloud. Gog, I will bring your army to attack the country that belongs to me, but what I will do to you will show the people of other nations that I am holy.

\v 14 Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: On that day, when my people Israel are living securely, will you not learn about them?
\v 15 You will come from your place far away in the north with a great army, all of them riding on horses, a great company, a large army.
\v 16 You will attack my people Israel like a cloud that covers the land. In the latter days I will bring you against my land, so the nations might know me when I show myself through you, Gog, to be holy before their eyes.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh tells Ezekiel what he is to say to Gog.

  * **son of man** - "son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "mortal person" or "human"
  * **On that day ... learn about them** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that Gog will indeed hear about the people living in Israel. AT: "On that day, when my people Israel are living securely, you will hear about them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **like a cloud that covers the land** - This simile means the army will be so large that it will cover the entire land. Translate this as you did a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:38:07|38:9]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **In the latter days** - This refers to the distant future before the world ends. AT: "In the last days" or "At the end of time" or "In the distant future"
  * **In the latter days ... to be holy before their eyes** - All the nations will understand that Yahweh is holy when they see what he does to Gog.
  * **might know me** - "might know who I am"
