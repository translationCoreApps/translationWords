\v 3 You think that your country is as great as Assyria was.
\q2 Well, Assyria was like a tall cedar tree in Lebanon;
\q1 it had big beautiful branches
\q2 that provided shade for other trees in the forest.
\q1 It was very tall;
\q2 and the branches of the tallest trees made a treetop that was a roof over the forest.
\q1
\v 4 Water came to it from deep springs,
\q2 and as a result that cedar tree grew tall and very green.
\q1 Then water flowed around the base of the tree
\q2 into channels that took water to other nearby trees in the open countryside.

\v 3 Behold! Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches, giving shade to the forest, 
\q and the tallest in height, and the branches formed its treetop. 
\q
\v 4 Many waters made it tall; the deep waters made it huge. Rivers flowed all around its area,
\q for their channels stretched out to all the trees in the field.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These are God's words to Pharaoh about Assyria. God gives his message in the form of a parable about a great cedar tree. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **Behold!** - "Look!" or "Listen!" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you!"
  * **Assyria was a cedar** - In this parable, God speaks about Assyria as if it were a great tree to emphasize how great and powerful the Assyrians were. This parable continues until 31:9. AT: "Assyria was like a cedar" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])
  * **the branches formed its treetop** - "its top was above the branches of the other trees." Some versions of the Bible translate this as "the top of the tree was in the clouds."
  * **Many waters made it tall** - "Because the cedar had a lot of water, it grew very tall"
  * **the deep waters made it huge** - "the water deep in the ground made the cedar grow very big"
  * **for their channels stretched out to all the trees in the field** - "and streams flowed from the rivers to all the trees of the field"
