====== Matthew 13 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 13:14-15, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

This chapter begins a new section. It contains some of Jesus' parables about the kingdom of heaven.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Parables ==

A parable is a short story used to illustrate a moral or religious lesson. In this chapter, the parables, reveal truth about the kingdom of heaven to those who have faith in Jesus. They also conceal these same truths from those who reject Jesus ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:10|13:11-13]]). These parables usually take the form of stories.

==Synecdoche and Merism ==
In this chapter, Matthew references the eyes seeing and the ears hearing. This chapter uses these figures of speech to encourage his reader to understand these parable's lessons.
