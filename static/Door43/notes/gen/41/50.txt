\v 50 Before the seven years of famine started, Joseph's wife Asenath gave birth to two sons.
\v 51 Joseph named the first one Manasseh, which sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'forget,' because he said, "God has caused me to forget all my troubles and all my father's family."
\v 52 He named his second son Ephraim, which means 'to have children,' because he said, "God has given me children here in this land where I have suffered."

\v 50 Joseph had two sons before the years of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.
\v 51 Joseph called the name of his firstborn Manasseh, for he said, "God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household."
\v 52 He called the name of the second son Ephraim, for he said, "God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
