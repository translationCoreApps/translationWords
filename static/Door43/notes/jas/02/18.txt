\v 18 But someone may say \add to me\add*, "\add God saves\add* some people only \add because\add* they trust \add in him\add*, and \add he saves\add* others \add because\add* they do good deeds \add to people\add*." \add I would answer that person\add*, "\add You\f + \ft singular \f* cannot\add* prove to me that people truly trust \add in God if\add* they do not do good deeds \add to others\add*! But by doing good deeds \add to others\add* I will prove to you that I truly trust \add in God\add*!
\v 19 \add Think about it\add*! You believe that there is only one God, and you are right \add to believe that\add*. But the demons also believe that, but they tremble \add because they know that God is going to punish them\add*.
\v 20 Also, you foolish person, I will \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* prove to you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* that \add if someone says\add*, 'I trust \add in God\add*,' but he does not do good deeds, \add what that person says\add* will not benefit him.

\v 18 But someone may say to me, "God saves some people only because they trust in him, and he saves others because they do good deeds for people." I would answer that person, "You cannot prove to me that people truly trust in God if they do not do good deeds for others! But by doing good deeds for others I will prove to you that I truly trust in God!
\v 19 Think about it! You believe that there is only one real God who truly lives, and you are right to believe that. But the demons also believe that, and they tremble because they also know that God truly lives, and that He will punish them.
\v 20 Also, you foolish person, I will give you proof that if someone says, "I trust in God," but does not do good deeds, what that person says does not help him in any way.

\v 18 Yet someone may say, "You have faith, and I have works." Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
\v 19 You believe that there is one God; you do well. But even the demons believe that, and they tremble.
\v 20 Do you want to know, foolish man, that faith without works is useless?
\f + \ft Some older versions read, \fqa Do you want to know, foolish man, how it is that faith without works is dead? \fqb \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yet someone may say** - James describes a hypothetical situation where someone objects to his teaching. James seeks to correct his audience's understanding of faith and works. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo|Hypothetical Situations]])
  * **You have faith, and I have works** - "It is acceptable if one person has faith and another person does good deeds." James is describing how someone may argue against his teaching.
  * **You have faith, and I have works ... Show me your faith** - James speaks of faith and works as objects that one can possess and show to others. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will show you my faith by my works** - James speaks of faith as if it could be seen while one does good works. AT: "I will demonstrate my faith by doing good works" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the demons believe that, and they tremble** - "the demons also believe, but they shake with fear." James contrasts the demons with those who claim to believe and not do good deeds. James states that the demons are wiser because they fear God while the others do not. 
  * **Do you want to know, foolish man, that faith without works is useless?** - This is a rhetorical question used to scold the person who will not listen to James. AT: "You fool! You do not want to listen to me prove that faith without works is useless." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **Do you want to know, ... useless?** - James poses this question to set up his next teaching. AT: "I will show you how, ... useless." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
