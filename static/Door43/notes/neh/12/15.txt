===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Adna was the leader of Harim ... and Nethanel was the leader of Jedaiah** - This continues to list the representatives of each family. 
  * **Meshullam was the leader of Ginnethon** - Ginnethon may be another form of the name Ginnethoi. 
  * **of Miniamin** - The Hebrew text mistakenly leaves out the name of the leader of the family of Miniamin. Some modern versions leave the expression incomplete, as the ULB does. Other versions provide a short explanation to make up for the omission of the leader's name (see UDB).
  * **Moadiah** - Maadiah may be another form of the name Moadiah. 
  * **Adna ... Harim ... Helkai ... Meraioth ... Zechariah ... Iddo ... Meshullam ... Ginnethon ... Zichri ... Abijah ... Miniamin ... Piltai ... Moadiah ... Shammua ... Bilgah ... Jehonathan ... Shemaiah ... Mattenai ... Joiarib ... Uzzi ... Jedaiah ... Kallai ... Sallai ... Eber ... Amok ... Hashabiah ... Hilkiah ... Nethanel ... Jedaiah** - These are all male names.
