\v 4 Do not cause yourself to become very tired by working very hard to become rich;
\q2 be wise and stop doing that,
\q1
\v 5 because as soon as you look \f + \ft metonymy \f* at \add all the money that you have acquired\add*, it will be gone;
\q2 it will disappear as if it suddenly grew wings \f + \ft simile \f*
\q2 and flew up into the sky like an eagle.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Do not work so much that you are always tired, so you can become rich;
\q2 be wise and know when you should stop and rest.
\q1
\v 5 As soon as you look at the money, it will be gone;
\q2 it will be as if it suddenly took up wings
\q2 and flew up like an eagle, up into the sky.

<usfm>
\q
\v 4 Do not work too hard to gain wealth;

\q It will be gone,
\q for it will surely take up wings like an eagle
\q and fly off to the sky.
