\v 24 After Jesus and his disciples left Galilee, they went to the region around the cities of Tyre and Sidon. While he stayed at a certain house, he did not want anyone to know it, but people soon found out that he was there.
\v 25 A certain woman, whose daughter had an evil spirit within her, heard about Jesus. At once she came to him and knelt at his feet.
\v 26 Now this woman was not a Jew. Her ancestors were not Jews. She herself had been born in the area around the region of Phoenicia, in the district of Syria. She pled with Jesus that he force the evil spirit out from her daughter.

\v 24 He got up from there and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. He came into a house and he did not want anyone to know he was there, yet he could not be hidden.
\v 25 But immediately a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, heard about him, came, and fell down at his feet.
\v 26 Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by descent. She begged him to cast out the demon from her daughter.
