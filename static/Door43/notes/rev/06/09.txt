===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Then the Lamb opened the fifth seal, and I saw under the altar in heaven the spirits of God's servants whom others had killed because these servants had believed God's message, the message to which God himself bore witness.
\v 10 They loudly asked God, "Sovereign Lord, you are holy and true. How long will it be before you condemn and punish the people on earth who murdered us?"
\v 11 Then God gave to each of them a white robe, and he told them to be patient a little longer. They should be patient until the number of those who also served the Lord with them—who were their brothers and sisters in Christ—would be killed just like they themselves had been killed because of their faith.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 9 When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed because of the word of God and the testimony which they held.
\v 10 They cried out with a loud voice, "How long, Ruler over all, holy and true, until you judge those who live on the earth, and until you avenge our blood?"
\v 11 Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told that they should wait a little longer until the full number of their fellow servants and their brothers and sisters was reached who were to be killed, just as they had been killed.
