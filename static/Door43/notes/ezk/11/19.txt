<usfm>
\v 19 I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them. I will take out the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,
\v 20 so that they will walk in my statutes, they will carry out my decrees and do them. Then they will be my people, and I will be their God.
\v 21 But to those who walk with affection toward their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their conduct on their own headsâ€”this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration."
