\v 1 Someone might say in reply to what I have written that since God has acted kindly toward us, perhaps we should continue to sin in order that his kindness would be the greater.
\v 2 No, certainly not! We are like people who have died, who can no longer do anything evil. So we should not continue to sin.
\v 3 When we were baptized in union with Christ Jesus, God viewed us as dying with Christ on his cross. Do you not know this?

\v 1 What then will we say? Should we continue in sin so that grace may abound?
\v 2 May it never be. We who died to sin, how can we still live in it?
\v 3 Do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Under grace, Paul tells those who believe in Jesus to live a new life as though dead to sin and alive to God.

  * **What then will we say? Should we continue in sin so that grace may abound?** - Paul asks these rhetorical questions to get the attention of his readers. AT: "So, what should we say about all of this? We certainly should not keep on sinning so that God will give us more and more grace! (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **we say** - The pronoun "we" refers to Paul, his readers, and other people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **We who died to sin, how can we still live in it?** - Here "died to sin" means that those who follow Jesus are now like dead people who cannot be affected by sin. Paul uses this rhetorical question to add emphasis. AT: "We are now like dead people on whom sin has no effect! So we certainly should not keep on sinning!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?** - Paul uses this question to add emphasis. AT: "Remember, when someone baptized us to show that we have a relationship with Christ, this also shows that we died with Christ on the cross! (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
