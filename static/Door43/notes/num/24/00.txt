====== Numbers 24 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The story of Balaam continues in this chapter.

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 24:3-9, 15-24, which are quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Cursing God's people ==

God does not allow others to curse his people. Balaam blesses Israel again and the king is angry and sends him home.  This may be taken as humor or an ironic situation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:curse]] and [[:en:obe:kt:peopleofgod]])
