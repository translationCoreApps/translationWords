====== 1 Corinthians 06:18 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Always run away from\f + \ft Or: avoid \f* committing sexually immoral acts. Other sins that people commit do not affect their bodies, but those who commit sexually immoral acts sin against their own bodies.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 So when you want to commit a sexual sin, run away from it as quickly as you can! People say, "Every sin that a person commits is committed outside the body"â€”except that when one sins sexually, he sins against his own body.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Run away from sexual immorality! Every other sin that a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Run away from** - Paul speaks of a person rejecting sexual sin as if that person were running away from danger. AT: "Get away from" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **immorality! Every other sin that a person commits is outside the body, but** - Possible meanings are 1) Paul is showing that sexual sin is especially bad because it is not only against others but against the sinner's own body or 2) Paul is quoting what some Corinthians were thinking, as he did in [[:en:bible:notes:1co:06:12|6:12-13]] "immorality! Some of you are saying, "Every sin that a person commits is outside the body," but I say that."
  * **commits** - "does"
