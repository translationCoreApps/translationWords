  * **Look** - This word is used here to draw peoples' attention to what is said next. It is also used here to mark a new section in the book. AT: "Listen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **envoys** - "messengers"
  * **the diplomats hoping for peace weep bitterly** - This means they weep because they do not succeed in making peace. AT: "the diplomats hope for peace but they do not succeed and so they weep bitterly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **The highways are deserted; there are no more travelers** - Both of the phrases emphasize that there are no travelers on the highways. These can be combined and stated in active form.

  * **Covenants are broken, witnesses are despised, and mankind is not respected** - This passage may refer to general conditions of corruption in Israel, or it may refer to the nation's inability to make reliable peace treaties with Assyria (see UDB). This can be stated in active form. AT: "People break covenants that they have made, people ignore the testimony of witnesses, and people do not respect one another" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
