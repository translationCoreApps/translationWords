\v 20 When David went home to ask Yahweh to bless his family, his wife Michal came out to meet him. She said to him, "Maybe you, the king of Israel, think that you were acting in an honorable way today, but really, you acted like a fool.

\v 20 Then David returned to bless his family. Michal, the daughter of Saul, came out to meet David and said, "How honored the king of Israel was today, who undressed himself today before the eyes of the slave girls among his servants, like one of the crude fellows who shamelessly undresses himself!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **came out** - Here "came" can be translated as "went." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_go]])
  * **How honored the king of Israel was today** - This is an ironic statement. Michal means the opposite of what she said, and she does not believe David acted honorably. Michal speaks disrespectfully to King David about his dancing attire and behavior. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **before the eyes of the slave girls** - Here "eyes of the slave girls" represents the slave girls. AT: "in front of the slave girls" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) 
  * **crude fellows** - Michal is comparing David to vulgar and foolish men.
